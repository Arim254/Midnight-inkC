    "body": "For years, bedtime was the most stressful part of my day. No matter how early we started or how carefully I planned, evenings always felt chaotic.I've heard the same story from many of the parents I've worked with, and it's understandable. Bedtime is a major emotional transition that most of us were never taught how to navigate.But as a conscious-parenting researcher who has studied over 200 kids, I've noticed a clear pattern: The happiest, most emotionally well-rounded children have parents who follow a predictable routine that lowers anxiety and strengthens connection. Here's what they do differently.1. They let go of controlMany parents head into bedtime expecting resistance, and children can sense that tension almost immediately.Parents who experience smoother evenings aren't attached to how long the routine takes or how perfectly it unfolds. When you soften your grip on the outcome, your child's nervous system will follow.Remember, if bedtime takes 90 minutes instead of 30, but your child falls asleep feeling safe and calm, that's still a win.2. They connect before they disconnectStalling, clinging, tantrums and irritability at bedtime can be signs of separation anxiety. Parents who understand this slow down the final moments of the evening. They offer physical closeness or quiet presence before saying goodnight. Even 10 to 20 minutes of intentional connection can make a difference. From there, you can set clear but warm boundaries: \"I'm here with you now. After two books and a cuddle, it's time to turn the lights out.\"3. They remove pressure around sleepMany bedtime battles are simply about pressure. When children feel they're expected to \"fall asleep\" on command, their nervous systems shift into alert mode, making rest harder. Parents with the easiest nights stop making sleep the goal. They focus on creating calm conditions. This makes it more likely for our bodies to settle naturally.4. They build a bridge from night into morningTo a child, bedtime can feel like an abrupt ending. You can ease this transition by emphasizing what comes next: \"We'll finish this in the morning,\" or, \"We'll snuggle again when the sun comes up.\"This helps children experience bedtime as a pause, not a loss, reducing anxiety and resistance.Some parents also create this bridge by ending the night with a simple point of connection. They might ask, for example, \"What are you most excited for tomorrow?\" 5. They end the night by reinforcing safetySafety is the signal that tells a child's nervous system it can finally stop bracing and start resting. Without it, even the tiredest body stays alert.You can reinforce safety by saying things like: \"Today was hard. Tonight was hard. And I'm still here.\"\"You didn't have to be perfect today. You just had to be you.\"\"I'm here. You can rest.\" 6. They regulate their own emotionsFinally, and this might be the most important one: Emotionally attuned parents regulate themselves. Evenings are when you are most depleted and therefore most likely to react from stress rather than intention.So pause before engaging. Take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself whether you're carrying stress from the day into the moment. Settle yourself first, then support your child.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "US' Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick (R) gestures on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesTwo congressional lawmakers on Sunday called on Howard Lutnick to resign amid revelations that the Commerce secretary had more extensive business and personal dealings with deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein than were previously disclosed.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Lutnick to step down after The New York Times reported the Trump ally interacted \"regularly\" with Epstein, according to files released by the Department of Justice relating to the notorious sex offender. Massie was the lead Republican on the Epstein Files Transparency Act that compelled the release of the Epstein files.\"He should just resign,\" Massie said on CNN's \"Inside Politics Sunday.\" \"Howard Lutnick clearly went to the island if we believe what's in these files; he was in business with Jeffrey Epstein, and this was many years after Jeffrey Epstein was convicted.\" He added: \"He's got a lot to answer for, but really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign.\"Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, took it a step further, calling on Lutnick to resign — or be fired.\"It's now clear that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been lying about his relationship with Epstein. He said he had no interactions with Epstein after 2005, yet we now know they were in business together,\" he wrote in a post late Sunday on X. \"Lutnick must resign or be fired. And he must answer our questions.\"Massie also noted that several British officials have been toppled over appearances in the Epstein files. Morgan McSweeney, the chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, resigned on Sunday over his role in appointing ousted U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was also named in the Epstein files.Lutnick's dealings with Epstein have come under increased scrutiny as dozens of public figures have been named in the files, which the DOJ has been releasing after a law was signed compelling their disclosure. The former chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald said on the podcast \"Pod Force One\" last year that he swore off interactions with Epstein after an initial encounter in 2005.

It was previously reported that Epstein had invited Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean, and that Lutnick had been communicating with Epstein about construction happening across the street from their homes. The two also had drinks in 2011, the files revealed. The Times report also includes new details, including that Epstein's lawyer obtained the resume of Lutnick's nanny and that Epstein donated $50,000 to an event honoring Lutnick. Epstein and Lutnick also invested in the now-defunct company AdFin Solutions, according to the Times report. A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Times that Lutnick had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, and called the report a \"failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments.\"CNBC has reached out to the Commerce Department and the White House for a response.",

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications and meetings involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech executives named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those executives have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. The latest documents reviewed by CNBC contained no indications of criminal wrongdoing or involvement in Epstein's illicit activities.However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "description": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. ",
    "body": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January. Democrats have also considered taking stakes in U.S. industries in the past. But the Trump administration's approach carries risks both for the companies involved and for the broader markets in which they operate. \"It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. \"Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?\" Many of the investments are in smaller critical mineral companies, like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials, but they also include big industrial and tech companies such as U.S. Steel and Intel. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. Historically, the U.S. has taken equity stakes in companies in the context of bailouts with the understanding that the investments were temporary and the government would exit its position when the company was financially viable again, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. President Barack Obama, for example, took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis and President Franklin Roosevelt took stakes in the banking sector during the Great Depression. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. \"I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed,\" Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said.  After the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Lutnick told CNBC that President Donald Trump wants the American taxpayer to benefit when the government gives money to corporations.But the administration's approach creates political, legal and business risks for the companies involved, Harrell and Lincicome said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.Political, legal riskThe Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. The Democrats have typically been the party of industrial policy and intervention in markets.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. The measure ultimately died in the Senate. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. And Biden considered launching a sovereign wealth fund. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. But the legal basis for the Trump administration's investments is a grey area, Harrell said. The administration seems to rely on the rationale that it can take stakes because the law doesn't explicitly forbid it and the companies have agreed to the deals, he said.  The lack of a clear legal basis makes the companies vulnerable to lawsuits from competitors, Harrell said. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said.\"If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in November, a bunch of the CEOs of these companies are going to be hauled up in front of committees to answer questions about how these deals are going,\" he said.Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face \"government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny\" and \"inquiries about conflicts of interest.\" It also warned the deal faces \"the risk of litigation\" and is vulnerable to \"changes in federal administration and related executive and legislative priorities.\"Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. Capital misallocation riskThe equity stakes also raise the question of whether the government can be trusted to make the right bets on companies and technologies that will succeed over the long term, Harrell said. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. \"That's just straight up capital misallocation,\" he said.Business decisions could also become politicized, he said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. In the case of U.S. Steel, the federal government has a governance stake, called a golden share, rather than an economic interest in the company. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois\"That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company,\" Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking \"taking an economic interest\" in its business \"not a governance interest.\" Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights.\"Maybe they don't have formal voting rights,\" Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. \"But they do have a phone and they can pick up the phone and call. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote.\"And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Corporate silenceTop executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. \"When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly conflicted\" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said.\"The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet,\" he said.",

    "body": "The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year.Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute.And the administration's portfolio could keep growing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin.  In the past, the U.S. has taken temporary stakes in companies in the context of bailouts, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. \"With these companies, it's a very different thesis,\" Harrell said. \"The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose.\" U.S. SteelPresident Trump secured a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer.  The golden share is a governance stake that gives the president veto power over key business decisions. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. MP MaterialsMP Materials is a critical minerals company headquartered in Las Vegas that operates the only commercial rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass in California. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion.The Defense Department struck a landmark deal with MP in July 2025 that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an agreement to buy a portion of future output. The Pentagon agreed to buy $400 million of preferred stock and is entitled to a warrant allowing it to purchase additional shares. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. IntelThe Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium AmericasLithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. It has a $1.5 billion market cap. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years.\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE.Trilogy MetalsTrilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials.President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. The investment makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. Trilogy is also headquartered in Vancouver and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. USA Rare EarthUSA Rare Earth is yet another critical minerals startup that is also not generating any revenue yet. It is developing a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma and plans to build a rare earth mine at a deposit called Round Top in Texas. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization.The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding.In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. The government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company, depending on whether the warrants are exercised. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest.\"WestinghouseWestinghouse is a private nuclear reactor developer. It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan ElementsVulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. It will receive a $620 million loan from the Pentagon, $550 million of incentives from the Commerce Department and raise $550 million in private capital.Under the deal, Commerce will receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan and the Pentagon gets warrants in the company. XLightXLight is a private company headquartered in Palo Alto, California that is developing free-electron lasers to manufacture semiconductors. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. In exchange, Commerce would receive a $150 million equity stake in xLight.L3HarrisL3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. It announced a proposed partnership with the U.S. government in December in which the Pentagon would invest $1 billion in its rocket motor business, whose motors are used in missile systems.Under the terms of the investment, L3Harris would launch an initial public offering of its missile business in the second half of 2026, at which point the Pentagon's $1 billion investment would convert into common equity of the spun off division.

    "body": "Apollo Global Management signage in New York on Dec. 5, 2023.Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate credit markets are facing fresh uncertainty as AI-driven tools start to pressure software companies, a major borrower group for private lenders.The software industry came under renewed pressure last week after artificial intelligence firm Anthropic unveiled new AI tools, sparking a sell-off in software data provider shares. The AI tools, developed by Anthropic, are designed to perform complex professional tasks that many software companies currently charge for, raising fresh concerns that AI could weaken traditional software business models.Shares of asset managers with large private credit franchises tumbled this week as investors fretted about how AI could upend borrowers' business models, pressure cash flows and ultimately lift default risks. Ares Management fell over 12% last week, while Blue Owl Capital lost over 8%. KKR declined almost 10%. TPG lost about 7%. Apollo Global and BlackRock fell over 1% and 5%, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 declined by about 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.8%.The moves bring to fore a growing unease around private credit market which now has to brace for the impact from AI-driven disruption to the software sector that is heavily exposed to buyouts financed with opaque, illiquid loans, according to market watchers.Private credit loans to a lot of software companies. If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.Jeffrey HookeJohns Hopkins Carey Business School\"Enterprise software companies have been a favored sector for private credit lenders since 2020,\" PitchBook wrote in a report last week following the fallout, adding that many of the largest-ever unitranche (two or more loans combined into one) loans, the favorite structure of the private credit market, have been to software and tech companies.Software makes up a significant share of loans held by U.S. business development companies, accounting for about 17% of BDC investments by deal count, second only to commercial services, data from PitchBook showed.That exposure could prove costly if AI adoption accelerates faster than borrowers can adapt. UBS Group has warned that, in an aggressive disruption scenario, default rates in U.S. private credit could climb to 13%, significantly higher than the stress projected for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, which UBS estimates could come to around 8% and 4%, respectively.\"Private credit loans to a lot of software companies,\" said Jeffrey C. Hooke, a senior lecturer in finance at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. \"If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.\"Hooke, however, said that strains in private credit pre-date the latest AI concerns, pointing to issues around liquidity and loan extensions. \"A lot of private credit funds have had problems liquidating their loans,\" he said, adding that the recent developments has simply added another layer to a sector already under pressure. watch nowThis slate of new warnings come on the back of recent concerns in the $3 trillion industry over leverage, opaque valuations and the risk that isolated problems may turn out to be systemic issuesJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warned late last year about private credit's 'cockroaches,' cautioning that stress in one borrower can signal more hidden trouble.\"AI disruption could be a credit risk for private credit lenders for some of its Software & Services sector borrowers and perhaps not for others as it depends on which ones are behind the AI curve and which ones are on top of it,\" said Kenny Tang, head of U.S. credit research at PitchBook LCD.Tang added that software and services companies account for the largest share of payment-in-kind (PIK) loans, which refer to arrangements where borrowers can delay paying interest in cash. While PIK structures are often used to give fast-growing companies time to build revenue and cash flow, they become risky if a borrower's finances weaken. In that case, deferred interest can quickly turn into a credit problem, he said. Moody Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi noted that while it is difficult to grasp a complete assessment of risks in the sector given its opacity, the rapid growth in AI-related borrowing, mounting leverage and a lack of transparency are considerable \"yellow flags.\"\"There will surely be significant credit problems, and while the private credit industry is probably currently able to absorb any losses reasonably well, this may not be the case a year from now if the current credit growth continues.\"",

    "body": "watch nowFor years, a growing number of students have been considering alternatives to a four-year degree. Now the trend toward a two-year program or even shorter-term credential — also dubbed \"un-college\" — is gaining steam. Ballooning college costs and the student loan debt that goes along with them are partly to blame. New borrowing limits for 2026 under President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" are another factor. Plus, students are increasingly seeking job training and career-driven pathways to secure a foothold in today's softening labor market. The term \"un-college\" first emerged about a decade ago to describe the rise of college alternative programs. This year, the shift will be striking, experts say.

Enrollment in private four-year nonprofit institutions fell by 1.6% over the same period.\"Overall enrollment is up slightly, but the real story is the shift between sectors,\" Matthew Holsapple, senior director of research at the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, said in a statement. \"Community colleges and public universities are gaining ground, while private colleges are down — a clear departure from the broad-based growth of recent years.\" Golden West College students walk to the GWC Student Union in Huntington Beach on Wednesday, Sept. 3, 2025. Leonard Ortiz | Orange County Register | MediaNews Group | Getty ImagesThe benefits of a two-year degree, vocational program or other types of certifications \"are amplified in an environment of economic uncertainty,\" according to DeRionne Pollard, president and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges. To be sure, the job market for new grads is shakier than it's been in years.As the rise of artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, there are fewer entry-level jobs for those just starting out. Some experts say this is the start of an AI-driven, white-collar recession.New grads face a challenging job marketEmployers are projecting just a 1.6% increase in hiring for the Class of 2026 when compared to the Class of 2025, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers. This year, more employers are also focusing on job applicants' skills rather than academic degrees or grade point averages, NACE's Job Outlook 2026 survey found.At the same time, a shortage of skilled tradespeople is boosting the number of job opportunities and pay in industries like nursing, manufacturing and construction, other research shows. Some in-demand trade jobs have average salaries well over $100,000 a year, according to the job site Indeed. How the 'big beautiful bill' may impact higher educationAmid a challenging job market, Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed last July, will usher in more sweeping changes to higher education. The legislation package establishes, for the first time, a cap on the amount of money that students and their families can borrow from the federal government to pay for college and graduate school. The new limits on federal student loans include a total lifetime borrowing limit of $257,500.Those limits are likely to prompt families to \"increasingly opt for more cost-efficient pathways, such as starting at a two-year college and then transferring to a four-year institution, or choosing in-state public universities over private colleges,\" said Tricia Scarlata, head of education savings at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"Now more than ever, weighing the return on investment … is essential, not optional,\" said Derek Brainard, financial director of education nonprofit AccessLex Institute.Further driving interest in \"un-college,\" the \"big beautiful\" law also includes new provisions for short-term Pell Grants. Beginning in mid-2026, students enrolling in workforce training programs at community colleges may be eligible for Pell funding, a need-based aid program for low-income students. \"The creation of Workforce Pell Grants will increase interest in very short programs that are inexpensive and closely tied to jobs,\" higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz said. The grants are worth up to $7,395 for the 2025-26 academic year. Previously, these funds were only available to degree-seeking undergraduate students.\"The smartest move students can make today is to plan with precision: explore scholarships, compare programs and avoid assuming that federal loans will fill every gap,\" Brainard said. \"Students should be running the numbers early — understanding program costs, federal limits and their long‑term borrowing capacity before committing.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "There are two ways to get back to the level of home affordability Americans had for much of the last decade, according to Realtor.com. Neither looks realistic anytime soon.In 2019, the mortgage payment for a median-priced home took up about 21% of median household income. Today, it accounts for more than 30%, reflecting sharply higher home prices and mortgage rates that have nearly doubled since January 2022, according to a recent analysis from the real estate listings platform.Barring a sharp drop in home prices, Realtor.com calculates that getting monthly payments back to 2019 levels would require one of two things:Household incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 todayMortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% as of Feb. 6Neither option appears likely in the near term. Real median household income has risen only about 17% over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mortgage rates are more likely to ease from their current 30-year fixed rate, though most forecasts still have them hovering near 6% through 2026.Even at that level, affordability gains may be limited. The National Association of Realtors projects that home prices will rise about 4% in 2026 as renewed demand runs up against stubborn supply shortages.\"The U.S. housing market continues to grapple with a persistent mismatch between housing supply and buyer demand,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"If buyer demand strengthens without a corresponding increase in supply, renewed price growth is likely.\"Limited housing supply remains a challengeA chronic shortage of homes continues to weigh on housing affordability. There is a nationwide housing shortfall of nearly 4 million homes, Realtor.com estimates, a gap that helps explain why lower mortgage rates or stronger wage growth alone may not be enough to deliver substantial affordability gains.\"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. For costs to go down, the supply of homes has to better meet demand, he says.Supply has been slow to catch up in part because zoning rules and lengthy permitting processes often limit how much new housing can be built or where it can go, according to a separate Realtor.com report from 2025.Expanding housing supply through additional construction and policy changes remains critical to easing affordability pressures, particularly in supply-constrained markets, according to NAR.At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced bipartisan proposals aimed at zoning, permitting and construction bottlenecks, though most remain in early stages.More change is happening at the state level. Texas and California have passed laws to loosen zoning rules and streamline permitting, but the impact has been mixed so far.The timeline for closing the housing supply gap also varies sharply by region, according to a 2025 Realtor.com report. At the current pace of construction and household formation, the report estimates the supply gap could close within three years in the South and six and a half years in the West. The Midwest would need roughly four decades. In the Northeast, the gap would not close at all under current trends.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowIf you've been online the past month at all, you likely encountered at least one hyper-saturated, neon-colored throwback post captioned somewhat along the lines of: \"2026 is the new 2016.\" What started as a social media meme could be lighting the fire for a broader shift in the cultural zeitgeist that might also boost retail brands synonymous with the era.The trend has dominated the social media cycle the past few weeks. On Jan. 16, a Spotify-linked Instagram account revealed that user-generated \"2016\" playlists soared more than 790% since Jan. 1, with top tracks added including Zara Larsson's \"Lush Life\" and Justin Bieber's \"Sorry.\" The post's caption was: \"2026 is the new 2016.\" A day earlier, the Instagram account for Hollister, a subsidiary brand of Abercrombie & Fitch, posted a heavily filtered carousel depicting emblems of 2016, including Polaroid cameras and the era's quintessential skinny jeans.Meanwhile, relative search volume for \"2016 aesthetic\" worldwide spiked to all-time highs on Google recently, underscoring the trend's growing traction.While the 2016 resurgence is playing out online, the question crossing investors' minds is whether this nostalgia reset could translate into a retail revival for brands that once defined the mid-2010s. One sign that the nostalgia wave is translating into real-world consumer behavior is that young adults are rediscovering the appeal of brick-and-mortar shopping after years of e-commerce dominance.\"Not that they don't buy most of their stuff online, but they like being in the store,\" Jan Kniffen, CEO of J. Rogers Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises, a retail consultant, said in an interview with CNBC.The shift reflects a deeper cultural undercurrent, as younger consumers increasingly find themselves longing for the carefree and familiar comfort of the mid-2010s.Reset shaped by today's economic uneaseJoel Marlinarson, social media strategist and owner of Coldest Creative, first identified the 2016 nostalgia trend in a TikTok post last July that has been viewed 1.1 million times. Marlinarson told CNBC that many Gen-Zers look back at the time as one that was less performative and more authentic, particularly as it relates to social media.\"I think people see this era as a universal feeling of the world being lighter,\" he said.Jamie Cohen, a digital culture expert and assistant professor of media studies at Queens College in New York, told CNBC that this \"consistent retro nostalgia\" is in line with young adults reminiscing about the last period of time before the \"ensh*ttiification\" of social media.\"There's a yearning for that period of simplicity in the aesthetic, of course, that leads into fashion as well,\" he said.Joanne Hsu pointed to a more structural issue — the earlier period was defined by a strong economy post-financial crisis, underpinned by low interest rates and inflation. By contrast, Hsu, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, believes that the revival today is a negative reaction to the volatility of high prices and unsettled politics.\"Consumers are kind of thinking about the current state of the economy relative to what it was before in the years prior to the pandemic,\" she told CNBC. \"Before the pandemic, things felt so much better.\"Hsu added that price pressures often push consumers to pull back on big-ticket purchases while continuing to spend selectively on smaller, feel-good items. She also pointed out that, historically, young adults have tended to be more optimistic views than older populations. But the last couple of years have seen a convergence as younger populations feel just as negative about the economy.\"What's clearer now is that it is not just nostalgia, it's also a form of risk aversion,\" Kniffen wrote in an email to CNBC. \"When society feels unstable to the consumer, they don't innovate aesthetically. They revert to the last era that felt 'manageable.'\"Kniffen told CNBC that retail trends typically last about 18 months. He expects this 2016 nostalgia cycle to have staying power through at least this year's midterm election, and suspects it could last another nine months after that.\"'2026 is 2016' is not just a trend cycle,\" said Kniffen. \"Maybe it's also a coping mechanism. But, whatever it is, it's real.\"Turning nostalgia into retail revivalThe brands that could benefit include ones that not only evoke rose-colored times, but also those successfully embody the ideals that \"vibes-based Gen-Zers\" seek — more authenticity and less intentionality, Cohen, the media studies professor, said.Marlinarson believes that the brands best poised to win are those with high awareness that have lost the cultural relevance they had in 2016.\"It's the brands that haven't maintained that cultural relevance that are using this as an opportunity to remind,\" the social media strategist said. \"The emotional tie that people have with brands that they wore when they were 10, when they were 15 — that's always going to be something that brands can latch onto.\"With the added benefit of time, brands that have previously suffered public relations disasters, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, now have the opportunity to distance themselves from past controversies.Abercrombie & Fitch is one company that Kniffen believes could ride this 2016 nostalgia wave, with both the flagship brand and Hollister in the \"right place, right time\" to capitalize on the 2016-esque \"peak casual but hot fashion.\"Fans wait as Lucy Hale appears at the Hollister store at Westfield Century City Mall to launch her collection on Aug. 9, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. Jason Merritt | Getty ImagesAs long as the company can successfully \"edit out all of the bad parts,\" management might have a shot at making a comeback, Cohen said. \"There's just so much of the past that isn't welcome in the present,\" he added.Kniffen sees Levi Strauss benefiting from a return to skinny and slim-straight fit jeans, applauding recent collaborations and collections that successfully revived old silhouette cuts. Along the same lines, American Eagle Outfitters could also gain by specializing in \"classic denim normcore.\" Although the company has struggled recently, there's room for a turnaround given its dominance in 2016, Kniffen said. Kniffen also likes Victoria's Secret, which arguably was at the zenith of its cultural popularity in 2016. The brand has made solid efforts to reclaim its market position, such as by shifting its strategy to focus more on inclusiveness and bringing back its runway fashion show in 2024 after a multi-year hiatus.Stella Maxwell walks the runway during Lady Gaga's performance at Victoria's Secret Fashion Show at Grand Palais in Paris, France, on Nov. 30, 2016. Hubert Boesl | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesUrban Outfitters was a brand that Kniffen highlighted as a potential beneficiary that has recently been doing well and was culturally important in 2016, as were its Anthropologie and Free People brands. Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors, applauded Urban's relatively new President of North America Shea Jensen as the driving factor behind the company's ability to successfully pinpoint future trends.\"They've really been able to be more in touch with what's cool, what's trending, and capitalize on that whereas in the past many years, the brand was a little lost,\" Widlitz said in a CNBC interview. \"If there's a throwback nostalgia play, that would probably be the most likely.\"Coty and KylieAnother company that could lead the charge is beauty company Coty, which owns a controlling stake in Kylie Cosmetics. Founded by Kylie Jenner, the brand's lip kits were an essential part of the 2016 makeup routine. The company has done a great job embracing the era's return, said Malissa Tiwari, social media strategist and owner of Marketing with M. As evidence, Tiwari pointed to Jenner's recent collection rollout on Snapchat, where she resuscitated her maximalist \"King Kylie\" persona that swarmed social media in 2016.\"Being one of the most culturally relevant beauty brands at the time, Kylie has used this as an opportunity to really position herself as the OG of the celebrity beauty brand playbook,\" Marlinarson added.A view of atmosphere during Kylie Jenner's 10 Years of Kylie Cosmetics Celebration with Friends & Family on Oct. 17, 2025 in West Hollywood, California. Phillip Faraone | Getty ImagesJenner was among a group of celebrities to share a 2016 throwback on her own Instagram. A post from Jan. 15 with the caption, \"you just had to be there,\" has received five million likes.Fellow cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty is another company that Tiwari sees leaning into the 2016 trend, with the brand tapping Nina Dobrev to star in a recent campaign. Dobrev starred in the CW show \"The Vampire Diaries\" from 2009 to 2017.As 2016 sneaker culture again rears its head, Kniffen believes that Foot Locker, acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods in 2025, stands to gain. \"These retailers benefit every time a 'retro-core' cycle revives dead sneaker stock,\" he wrote to CNBC.Kniffen also sees a chance for Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, now owned by PVH, to exploit a return to \"classic normcore\" as the \"older of the young\" get in on the trend. Oliver Chen, retail analyst at TD Cowen, highlighted Coach, owned by Tapestry, as a brand that could win with Gen Z owing to nostalgia, quality and marketing.Other social media discourse highlighted the publicly traded companies Snapchat, famous for its flower crown filters that took off in the mid-2010s, and V.F. Corporation, which owns Vans, as other companies that could spearhead the return to 2016. Outside of retail, Marlinarson believes that Coca-Cola could win after the company brought back its \"Share a Coke\" campaign \"for a New Generation\" last year.",

Trump and his allies vehemently denied that he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, an assertion that has proven to be false. Fulton County was central to now-debunked claims of election fraud, with the president and his surrogates continuing to make allegations of fraud to this day despite a hand recount affirming Biden's victory in the state. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's appearance at the Georgia raid has only added to speculation, with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee denouncing the appearance. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and other Democrats have warned that Trump may attempt to meddle in the 2026 midterm elections.\"When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past, it is about shaping the outcome of future elections,\" Warner said last week. Gabbard has defended her appearance at the election center, writing in a letter to Warner that it was \"requested\" by Trump and that she only observed the operation \"for a brief period of time.\" Trump later said at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday that it was actually Attorney General Pam Bondi who insisted Gabbard oversee the raid.Trump recently has been calling for a federal takeover of elections. States and local government typically run elections without interference from the federal government.",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday endorsed Nexstar Media's proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, just months after criticizing the deal.\"We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar - Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level. Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future. GET THAT DEAL DONE!\"Under the agreement, Nexstar, which owns or partners with over 200 stations, would add Tegna's 64 stations — covering roughly 80% of the country. The deal, announced in August 2025, was expected to close in the second half of 2026. Trump's backing of the Nexstar-Tegna deal marks an abrupt turnaround. In a Truth Social post in November, Trump railed against the Nexstar-Tegna deal and the potential for more industry consolidation.\"If this would also allow the Radical Left Networks to 'enlarge,' I would not be happy,\" Trump wrote. \"ABC & NBC, in particular, are a disaster - A VIRTUAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. They should be viewed as an illegal campaign to the Radical Left. NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!\"Nexstar, Tegna and the White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The proposed Nexstar-Tegna deal is part of a string of recent media consolidation efforts as cord-cutting threatens the industry.\"We believe that broadcast news is essential to this country and a free democracy, independent local news, and that broadcast TV is basically the last bastion of local news at the local level, and our goal is to become a bigger company and hopefully be able to compete on a level playing field with Big Tech that is pervasive in all aspects of media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook told CNBC after the deal announcement. watch nowCurrently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits a company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households to foster competition. For Nexstar's deal to go through, the FCC would have to lift that rule.\"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal.In September, Nexstar was the first media company to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late-night talk show's host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

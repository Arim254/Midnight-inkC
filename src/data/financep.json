    "body": "The People's Bank of China (PBOC) building in Beijing, China, on Tuesday, April 18, 2023.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged Tuesday as authorities navigate a balancing act of supporting a slowing economy while maintaining currency stability. The People's Bank of China held its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates at 3% and 3.5%, respectively, keeping them steady for a tenth straight month despite stuttering economic growth. The 1-year rate serves as the benchmark for most new and outstanding loans, while the 5-year level influences mortgages. The world's second-largest economy showed signs of slowing down in the final quarter of last year, expanding 4.5% year on year, its slowest pace since the country lifted its stringent Covid curbs in late 2022.  Chinese authorities have struggled to lift the economy out of an entrenched deflation as consumers cut back spending amid a prolonged real estate downturn, a bleak job market and uncertain income prospects. Retail sales growth fell to a 3-year low of 0.9% in December while the GDP deflator — a metric that shows changes in prices of goods and services — has stayed negative for 11 consecutive quarters. Policymakers have turned to promoting the consumption of services to boost overall spending, betting that elderly care services, leisure and tourism can help make up for the tepid demand in goods. The Chinese yuan has continued to appreciate in recent months, with the offshore yuan strengthening from around 6.974 per U.S. dollar at the start of the year to 6.889 Tuesday morning, according to LSEG data. The PBOC in recent weeks has signaled some tolerance for a gradual strengthening in its currency, with the dollar's weakness paving the way for the yuan to extend its advance. The central bank manages the yuan by keeping it within a band that is 2% on either side of a midpoint that it fixes each trading day. The officials have moved its so-called fixing level lower, dipping below the 7-benchmark for the first time in nearly three years in late January. A strengthening yuan could test the country's export machine already under pressure due to U.S. tariffs, eroding a competitive advantage for exporters who face price pressure from other manufacturing rivals. Economists at ING forecast a fluctuation band of 6.85 to 7.25 this year as Beijing seeks to advance the internationalization of its currency. \"The wildcard will be if the currency stability objective is softened in 2026,\" the bank said.

    "body": "Former British Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson is led away from his home by a police officer as he is arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following revelations over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in London, Britain, Feb. 23, 2026, in this screen capture from video.BBC | Via ReutersPolice in London released Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the United States, on bail Tuesday local time, hours after his arrest earlier.Mandelson has been under investigation for his relationship with notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Metropolitan Police in London said that Lord Mandelson, 72, was arrested Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the same grounds on which other police in Britain last week arrested and briefly detained Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and longtime friend of Epstein. Police did not identify Mandelson by name, as is customary in Britain, but photos of him being led from his house by police were published Monday. In an update Tuesday, the police said \"a 72-year-old man arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office\" was released on bail pending further investigation.Police were known to be investigating whether he leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. Mandelson, who was fired in September on orders from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after revelations about his dealings with Epstein, has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"He was arrested at an address in Camden ... and has been taken to a London police station for interview,\" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\"This follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden area,\" police said. \"We are not able to provide further information at this stage to prevent prejudicing the integrity of the investigation.\"Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords in early February, but retained his title of lord.In a statement then, he said, \"I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe [Epstein] following his conviction [in 2008] and to continue my association with him afterwards.\"\"I apologize unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered,\" Mandelson said.The Guardian reported that Starmer's spokesperson told reporters in early February, \"The prime minister believes that Peter Mandelson should not be a member of the House of Lords or use the title.\"However, the prime minister does not have the power to remove it. He is calling on those in the Lords to work with the government to modernise disciplinary procedures in the house, to allow for the easier removal of lords who have brought the house into disrepute.\"Mandelson's arrest came four days after British police arrested Mountbatten-Windsor, brother of King Charles III, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.Mountbatten-Windsor was released later Thursday. While the nature of the investigation into him was not revealed, Thames Valley Police have said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.",

    "body": "An Eli Lilly & Co. Zepbound injection pen arranged in the Brooklyn borough of New York on March 28, 2024.Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Monday launched a new form of its blockbuster obesity drug, Zepbound, that offers a month's worth of doses in a single pen.Cash-paying patients can get the multi-dose device, called KwikPen, on the company's direct-to-consumer website, LillyDirect. Prices start at $299 per month for the lowest dose level. The pen could serve as a more convenient option for some patients, as it reduces the number of devices they have to use in a month to take the drug. Patients can use one pen to take four weekly doses of Zepbound. Currently, patients on the treatment use a different single-dose auto-injector device each week. Lilly also offers single-dose vials of Zepbound, which require users to draw the medication into a syringe and inject themselves. The announcement comes as Lilly works to sustain the early success of Zepbound, which has exploded in demand since it first entered the market in late 2023. LillyDirect has been key to Zepbound's growth, and rolling out a new form of the drug on the platform could attract even more patients. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe torrid growth of Zepbound has helped Eli Lilly seize a majority share of the weight loss drug market from rival Novo Nordisk. In the company's fourth quarter, Zepbound brought in $4.2 billion in U.S. revenue, a 122% spike from the previous year. In a release, Lilly said the Food and Drug Administration approved a label expansion for Zepbound to include the multi-dose device.The KwikPen is already used for other drugs, such as Lilly's popular diabetes medication, Mounjaro. \"As part of our commitment to supporting people living with obesity in their weight management journey, we are introducing a new option with the Zepbound KwikPen, a device trusted by patients globally and in the United States for other Lilly medicines,\" said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities, in the release. ",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, a Domino's pizza sits in a take-out box on July 21, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesDomino's Pizza shares climbed on a Monday after the company posted a better-than-expected quarter and laid out ambitious growth plans. The strong performance came as the pizza chain said it saw higher transactions and better traction among lower-income diners with its value offerings.The pizza chain reported same-store sales growth of 3.7%, better than the 3.1% projected by Wall Street. Revenue of $1.54 billion was also higher than the $1.52 billion estimated by analysts, at a time when the broader pizza category and restaurant sector at large has faced headwinds. Domino's chief executive told CNBC in an interview Monday that the company is really just getting started, and it aims to double its market share.\"I want people to understand that I think we can double this business, and it's not a stretch, given our track record, and given how we are in other markets, to think we can get there,\" CEO Russell Weiner said.The quarterly report comes at a time when Domino's two biggest public competitors are struggling. Sales rumors are circling both Yum Brands' Pizza Hut, which has been under a recently completed strategic review, and Papa John's. While both Domino's and Papa John's stocks have fallen this year, Domino's stock has fallen about 3.6%, versus a 13.8% drop for its rival. Weiner said the success has come from offering value on Domino's core menu item. In the past, he's called this discounting on the center of the plate.\"The only disruption in the pizza category, is the disruption that we're causing, right? Is the category still growing 1 to 2 percent [and] we're up 11 share points in 11 years,\" he said. \"Two of our major competitors ... the rumor on both of those is they're off for sale. And so if that goes through, we're in a pretty unique place.\"The growth this quarter also came from traffic, or more purchases, instead of ticket, or order value — a rarity in the industry that McDonald's and Starbucks were also able to achieve. Weiner touted strength in spending among lower-income consumers, which grew in the fourth quarter and for the year.He's calling it \"profit power.\"\"We can sustain this price and make money ... why would we want to take price [and] feed less consumers, if we can maintain and grow our franchisees' profitability on this lower price and still take share,\" he said.",

    "body": "International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInternational Business Machines stock is getting slammed Monday, becoming the latest perceived victim of rapidly developing AI technology, after Anthropic said its Claude Code tool could be used to modernize legacy systems that run COBOL. Shares of IBM closed the day lower by nearly 13.2%, at $223.35 per share, after Anthropic on Monday said Claude Code could be used to automate the exploration and analysis work that drives most of the complexity in COBOL modernization, a key IBM business. IBM has long sold mainframe systems that are optimized for large-scale transaction processing, where COBOL has often been used. Short for Common Business-Oriented Language, COBOL is a dominant code system developed in the late 1950s often used in business data processing, such as payment processing and retail transaction systems. An estimated 95% of ATM transactions in the U.S. use COBOL, according to Anthropic, making it a prime target for cost-efficient AI disruption.\"Hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL run in production every day, powering critical systems in finance, airlines, and government. Despite that, the number of people who understand it shrinks every year,\" Anthropic wrote in a Monday blog post. \"AI excels at streamlining the tasks that once made COBOL modernization cost-prohibitive.\"Claude Code can help modernize COBOL codebases by mapping dependencies across thousands of lines of code, documenting workflows and identifying risks that \"would take human analysts months to surface,\" Anthropic said. \"Legacy code modernization stalled for years because understanding legacy code cost more than rewriting it. AI flips that equation,\" the blog post said. This latest use case builds on Anthropic's effort to disrupt legacy code systems and companies' digital transformation efforts, which it says are bogged down, in part, by decreasing developer productivity and \"technical debt.\" Technical debt refers to the future costs of shortcut solutions in software development that lead to increased maintenance for companies down the line.IBM is the latest stock to fall on AI fears, which have rattled investors in recent weeks and contributed to a volatile \"sell first and ask questions later\" trading environment. On Friday, a slew of cybersecurity companies tumbled after Anthropic unveiled a new capability it built into Claude Code, called Claude Code Security, that it said can scan codebases for security vulnerabilities and find software vulnerabilities for humans to review. The sector remained under pressure in Monday's session. Monday's sell-off brought IBM shares down more than 24% year to date.",

Mandelson, like the former British prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was himself arrested on the same charge last week, has been under investigation in connection with confidential information they shared with Epstein.A number of other prominent people have left their jobs after their correspondence with Epstein was released by the DOJ. Being mentioned in the DOJ files is not proof of wrongdoing, and no one in the files has been criminally charged since they were made public.Attia was among a group of new CBS News contributors recruited by editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who herself was hired in October, two months after the network's parent, Paramount Skydance, completed a merger between its two prior constituent parts, Paramount Global and Skydance Media.FILE PHOTO: Bari Weiss speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 3, 2022.  Mike Blake | ReutersIn a post on X on Feb. 3, Attia said he had told his team and patients, \"I was not involved in any criminal activity;\" \"My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone;\" and \"I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties.\"\"That said,\" Attia added, \"I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me. I accept that reality and the humiliation that comes with it.\"Attia, in his tweet, addressed a June 2015 email to Epstein with the subject line \"Got a fresh shipment,\" in which the doctor included a photograph of bottles of the medication metformin.Epstein \"replied with the words 'me too' and attached a photograph of an adult woman,\" Attia wrote. \"I responded with crude, tasteless banter.\"\"Reading that exchange now is very embarrassing, and I will not defend it. I'm ashamed of myself for everything about this. At the time, I understood this exchange as juvenile, not a reference to anything dark or harmful,\" he added.Attia also wrote that he met Epstein in 2014 \"through a prominent female health leader while I was raising funds for scientific research.\"Epstein had been released from a Florida state jail about five years earlier after serving a 13-month term for his conviction of soliciting sex from a minor.\"Between summer 2014 and spring 2019, I met with him on approximately seven or eight occasions at his New York City home, regarding research studies and to meet others he introduced me to. I never visited his island or ranch, and I never flew on any of his planes,\" Attia wrote on X.\"When I was at his home, it was either meeting with him directly, meeting with small groups of scientists, doctors, or business leaders, and once at a dinner in 2015 with a number of guests including prominent heads of state.\"\"Shortly after we met, I asked him directly about his 2008 conviction. He characterized it as prostitution-related charges,\" Attia wrote. \"In 2018, I came to learn this was grossly minimized ... I was incredibly naïve to believe him. I mistook his social acceptance in the eyes of the credible people I saw him with for acceptability, and that was a serious error in my judgment. To be clear, I never witnessed illegal behavior and never saw anyone who appeared underage in his presence.Epstein killed himself in jail in New York in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "A worker unloads packages from a FedEx truck on Cyber Monday in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.Bess Adler | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Express on Monday sued the U.S. government, seeking a \"full refund\" of the money the shipping giant paid for tariffs unilaterally imposed last year by President Donald Trump, which the Supreme Court ruled last week were illegal.FedEx's suit appears to be the first filed by a major American company seeking a refund for tariffs after Friday's Supreme Court decision.Other companies filed lawsuits staking claims to their refunds before the high court ruled that the tariffs Trump imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. Those suits, whose plaintiffs include retail warehouse club giant Costco, remain pending at the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, the same court where FedEx filed its lawsuit.The Supreme Court, in its ruling on Friday, said the Court of International Trade has \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the IEEPA tariffs.\"Plaintiffs seek for themselves a full refund from Defendants of all IEEPA duties Plaintiffs have paid to the United States,\" Federal Express Corp, and its associated company, FedEx Logistics, said in the new lawsuit.The 11-page complaint names as defendants U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which collects tariffs, its commissioner, Rodney Scott, and the U.S. government.CNBC has requested comment on the suit from CBP and the White House.The suit does not say how much FedEx has paid in IEEPA tariffs since Trump imposed them on most U.S. trading partners last year.But in September, FedEx had said that it expected it would take a $1 billion hit to its earnings for the fiscal year because of U.S. trade policies, not all of which involved IEEPA duties. That dollar amount represents 16% of total earnings for the prior fiscal year.In a note on its website, FedEx said, \"While the Supreme Court did not address the issue of refunds,  FedEx has taken necessary action to protect the company's rights as an  importer of record to seek duty refunds from U.S. Customs and Border  Protection.\"\"At this time, however, no refund process has been established by regulators or the courts,\" the company said. \"We will communicate any relevant information and updates in a timely manner, and we appreciate  your patience as we wait for additional guidance and clarity from the U.S. government and the courts.\"",

Terms weren't disclosed, but Uber said on Monday that it plans to offer a \"parking reservation experience, powered by SpotHero\" within its own app to help users find parking for events, venues and airports. \"For the moments when people do choose to drive, SpotHero on the Uber app will make the experience easier than ever, and bring more people into the Uber ecosystem,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. Earlier this month, Uber reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth-quarter but issued soft profit guidance for the current period, sending the stock down. The company's strongest revenue growth for the quarter was in its delivery business, which started with restaurants and now includes groceries and retail.Uber's expansion into new markets and geographies has turned into the dominant U.S. ride-hailing company. Its market cap currently sits at $146 billion, while Lyft is valued at just over $5 billion. Within food delivery, Uber faces stout competition from companies including DoorDash, which has a market cap of over $71 billion.SpotHero last announced outside funding in 2019, when it raised $50 million in a round led by Macquarie Capital. The Chicago-based company launched in 2011, and now says it offers parking at more than 13,000 garages, lots and valets in over 400 cities in the U.S. and Canada.\"Joining forces with Uber will allow us to bring that experience to millions more drivers and make parking a natural part of the Uber platform,\" SpotHero CEO Mark Lawrence said in a statement. Uber said the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of this year.

    "body": "2026 Jeep CherokeeMichael Wayland / CNBCLOS ANGELES – Stellantis is counting on the return of the Jeep Cherokee to help lead a U.S. turnaround for the SUV brand and embattled automaker. The Cherokee returns after a three-year hiatus, rejoining the compact and midsize vehicle markets, which represent the largest segments in the U.S. It also marks Jeep's first traditional hybrid model and its most fuel-efficient, gas-powered vehicle ever in the U.S.\"This is a critical vehicle for us,\" Richard Cox, Jeep senior vice president of brand operations, told CNBC during a media event for the 2026 Cherokee. \"I think this expands our reach with this level of powertrain, with this level of fuel efficiency and capability.\"The vehicle is currently arriving in U.S. dealerships as arguably the most important U.S. launch for the automaker this year. Stellantis is attempting to regain market share after significant losses in recent years. The automaker has set a target to increase retail sales by roughly 25% in 2026 to 1.15 million vehicles, driven by updated and new models as well as pricing and product realignments to move vehicles off dealer lots. \"It's a huge part of our growth,\" Cox said regarding the new Cherokee. \"It positions us well in '26.\" The interior of the 2026 Jeep Cherokee Overland.StellantisLast year, Jeep narrowly reported its first annual sales increase – up less than 1% – since 2018, when the brand achieved sales of more than 973,200 units. That compares with sales of 593,401 Jeeps in 2025, a 39% decline over the seven-year period.The 1% annual sales growth for Jeep wasn't enough to lift Stellantis' overall U.S. sales into the black for the year, though. The parent company reported a 3% decline in U.S. sales in 2025 – marking its seventh consecutive fall amid a failed push into all-electric vehicles and significant cost cutting and price increases under former CEO Carlos Tavares.Sean Hogan, a Los Angeles-area dealer who's leading Stellantis' franchised national dealer council, believes the 25% target increase in U.S. sales is achievable with the company's new leadership and product slate.\"We've been missing Cherokee. It's huge to us. It's huge to Jeep, and I think they nailed it,\" said Hogan, vice president of Sierra Auto Group. \"It's key for us to getting the machine turned back on to start the volume that's going to be flowing again and generate the capacity in our dealerships. It's bringing in new customers.\" Jeep Cherokee is priorityJeep believes it has a winner with the Cherokee, even more so than the last generation of the vehicle that peaked at nearly 240,000 units sold in 2018. The company declined to discuss production expectations, but it likely won't be able to achieve similar sales numbers until the company adds U.S. output capabilities. Plans to expand production at an Illinois plant are expected as early as next year.The Cherokee is currently only being produced at a plant in Toluca, Mexico, that also manufactures a smaller Jeep Compass SUV and Jeep Wagoneer S EV, and is slated to produce the upcoming Jeep Recon EV as soon as the second quarter.Stellantis' Toluca plant is estimated to have the capacity to produce 303,000 vehicles annually, according to AutoForecast Solutions. The auto intelligence and forecasting firm expects Jeep's U.S. sales this year to increase roughly 10% to 650,000 units, led by the Cherokee, according to Sam Fiorani, AFS vice president of global forecasting.Read moreJeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC in December that Cherokee is the priority for the brand amid slowing EV sales.\"Once Cherokee is done and has a good run rate, then we can start on Recon,\" he said. \"Recon, I'm not in a hurry. I want to get the quality right of Cherokee, and then as soon as we're confident, OK, turn on the Recon.\" Broderdorf has been leading a turnaround strategy for Jeep since being named CEO in February. Those efforts have included significantly reducing prices and model complexity and shifting away from the brand's all-electric plans as part of a broader pullback by Stellantis that will cost the company $26 billion.2026 CherokeeThe 2026 Cherokee is a traditional hybrid – a technology pioneered by the Toyota Prius – that does not require a plug, but does use a small battery and electric motors to assist fuel economy.Jeep has historically been known for its large, boxy gas-guzzling SUVs, but the Cherokee is expected to achieve 37 combined miles per gallon, including 35 mpg on the highway and 39 mpg in the city.\"Those are very competitive numbers,\" said Mike Cockell, director of Jeep Cherokee nameplate. \"It's a vehicle that must do it all for the customer, and we feel we're able to do it all. It's like a Swiss army knife.\"The updates are an attempt to make the vehicle more competitive against brands such as Toyota as well as to capitalize on expected growth in hybrid vehicles. \"Electrification trends are pretty flat. Hybrid trends are absolutely growing,\" Cox said. \"So, I think it was a big move in the right direction.\"The Cherokee features a 1.6-liter turbocharged, four-cylinder hybrid powertrain rated at 210 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. It features standard four-wheel drive, relatively large interior screens, and 140 standard and available safety and security features.Starting pricing for the Cherokee ranges from roughly $37,000 to $46,000, according to Stellantis. The bestselling model is expected to be the $39,995 Cherokee Laredo, which Stellantis says is projected to represent 36% of the vehicle's sales.The pricing positions the midsize vehicle to be competitive in its own segment as well as against compact SUVs such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V.Jeep officials say those two brands served as benchmarks for the updated Cherokee. 'We have a number of customers that have either defected or they've moved into something else because we didn't have a product offering for them. So, this is our chance to get them back into the family, and I think do some conquesting as well,\" Cox said.",

    "body": "Aileen Cannon, judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.Courtesy: US CourtsA Florida federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump blocked the public release of a final report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his prosecution of Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House at his Mar-a-Lago club and for blocking efforts to retrieve them.Judge Aileen Cannon, in her order, cited her July 2024 ruling that Smith was not legally appointed as special counsel, which led to her dismissing the criminal case against Trump, as the key reason she said that Volume II of his final report on the case should not be made public. Smith had obtained a grand jury indictment of Trump on charges related to those documents in June 2023, more than two years after Trump ended his first term in the White House.Cannon also on Monday rejected a request by Trump's two co-defendants in the case to have Smith's report destroyed.In her order permanently blocking the release of that report, Cannon blasted Smith for his \"brazen stratagem\" of compiling evidence and other material obtained during his investigation and \"compiling it into a final report\" to the attorney general after she ruled his appointment as special counsel violated the appointments clause of the U.S. Constitution. Smith had taken those actions while appealing the judge's dismissal of the criminal case against Trump. The Department of Justice dropped that appeal after Trump won the 2024 presidential election.Cannon, in her ruling Monday, said releasing Smith's report \"would cause irreparable damage to former defendants from disclosure of non-public\" material that was exchanged between Smith's prosecution team and defense lawyers, which involved \"still-contested grand jury and privilege concerns.\"\"And it would contravene basic notions of fairness and justice in the process, where no adjudication of guilt has been reached following initiation of criminal charges,\" Cannon wrote in her order in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\"There is the matter of manifest injustice to the former defendants that would result from disclosure of Volume II,\" she wrote. \"Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges. As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.\"Former U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith arrives for a closed-door deposition as part of a House Judiciary Committee inquiry into his now-dismissed cases against U.S. President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his retention of classified documents, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 17, 2025. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersTrump's co-defendants in the case, his valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago worker Carlos de Oliveira, originally asked Cannon to block the release of Smith's report. Trump in January asked Cannon to bar it from being made public.In a curious footnote in her order on Monday, Cannon referenced the fact that her ruling blocking the release of Smith reports could be appealed and that her decision could be overturned by either the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. \"As always, this Court will follow whatever mandates come from a higher court in resolving any future requests for judicial relief in this or any other case,\" Cannon wrote.Federal district court judges, as a rule, follow mandates from higher federal courts and do not typically take the time to affirm that practice in a written order.Also on Monday, Cannon denied a motion by two groups, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and American Oversight, to stay her ruling on releasing Smith's report pending the outcome of their appeals of her prior ruling blocking them from pursuing arguments that the report should be made public.The Knight Institute, earlier in February, asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse a prior order by Cannon barring the release of Smith's report. The institute is also arguing to the 11th Circuit that Cannon does not have the authority to enjoin the release of the report.\"Judge Cannon's decision to permanently block the release of this extraordinarily significant report is impossible to square with the  First Amendment and the common law,\" said Scott Wilkens, senior counsel  at the Knight Institute, in a statement on Monday. \"There is no legitimate basis for its continued  suppression.\"Lanny Breuer, an attorney for Smith, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Smith, during recent testimony to Congress, indicated he was barred from commenting on the contents of his report, given Cannon's prior rulings temporarily barring its disclosure.Kendra Wharton, a lawyer for Trump, in a statement said, \"Jack Smith was unconstitutionally appointed and his unlawful investigation was improperly funded with tens of millions of US taxpayers' hard earned dollars.\"\"Any and all fruit of Smith's poisonous tree should be treated accordingly and should never see the light of day,\" Wharton said.Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, in a statement said, \"Judge Cannon's ruling continues a troubling pattern of decisions that shield the president from public scrutiny and place secrecy above the public's right to know.\"By permanently blocking the release of Volume II of the Special Counsel's report and denying our effort to seek a stay while our appeal moves forward, the court has ensured that the public is denied information of extraordinary national importance,\" Chukwu said. \"This sweeping order once again gives the president exactly what he wanted — continued concealment of the factual record underlying the historic investigation into his misconduct. American taxpayers funded this investigation, and they have a right to know what their government uncovered, particularly on matters of national security,\" Chukwu said. \"We will continue using every tool available to force this information into the open and to defend the public's right to the truth through the release of this report.\"",

Shannon Stapleton | ReutersA powerful blizzard ground air travel to a near halt at major airports serving New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and other areas of the eastern U.S. on Monday. Disruptions are set to last through at least Tuesday, again testing carriers on how quickly they can recover at the tail end of winter break.Much of the East Coast from Maryland to Maine was under a blizzard warning, with heavy snow already totaling nearly 2 feet in parts of New Jersey and on Long Island, New York. High wind gusts are expected to last throughout the day, the National Weather Service said. The weather service warned that travel will be treacherous, with blowing snow causing low visibility.More than 4,900 U.S. departures Monday, or close to 20% of the total scheduled U.S. departures, were canceled, as of 4:10 p.m. ET, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Daily cancellations usually run around 1% of the day's schedule. Nearly a quarter of the inbound international flights were also canceled.More than 1,000 departures and arrivals in and out of New York's LaGuardia Airport, more than 90% of the day's schedule, were canceled Monday. More than 90% of the flights at Boston Logan International Airport and more than 80% of the flights at Philadelphia International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey were also scrubbed.On Tuesday, 1,576 flights had already been canceled, around 7% of the daily schedule, Cirium said. Around half of the departures at Kennedy Airport, LaGuardia and Boston were canceled for Tuesday.American Airlines said operations at the those three airports are set to resume on Tuesday, adding that flights have already resumed at Philadelphia and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.

    "body": "An aerial view of the Tesla Fremont Factory in San Rafael, California, Jan. 29, 2026.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesTesla is suing California's Department of Motor Vehicles to reverse a ruling that found the automaker violated the law by falsely promoting its cars' self-driving capabilities.The suit comes two months after the state's Office of Administrative Hearings determined that Tesla engaged in false advertising, and said the DMV could temporarily suspend the company's licenses to manufacture or sell cars in the state. The DMV instead asked Tesla to clean up its marketing language. By Feb. 17, the agency said Tesla had done so appropriately and no license suspension would be required. But Tesla, which is banking much of its future on robotaxis, wants the DMV to go further. In their complaint, dated Feb. 13, attorneys for the automaker alleged that the agency \"wrongfully and baselessly\" labeled Tesla a \"false advertiser\" for its prior use of the terms \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving.\" Tesla now uses the brand name \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" to describe its partially automated driver assistance system, and it sells it only on a subscription basis. In the past, Tesla packaged partially automated driving features in Autopilot standard, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving tiers, and it offered some customers \"beta\" or early access to new features, which are not yet fully debugged. It sold the systems for a single up-front fee.The DMV did not immediately provide a comment. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long promised investors and customers that the company's cars would be upgraded over time via over-the-air software updates that would turn them into robotaxi-ready vehicles. That hasn't happened yet, though the company's systems have become more sophisticated.After sales of its electric vehicles declined last year, Tesla's future success hinges largely on its ability to deliver driverless systems that make their cars safe to use without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is now testing a handful of automated vehicles in its Robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Last week, the company announced the start of production of its forthcoming Cybercab, a two-seater designed without a steering wheel or pedals, in Texas. Tesla has for years presented its systems as if they were safe to use without an attentive driver. For example, in 2018 Musk appeared on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" driving in a Model 3 with Autopilot engaged and correspondent Lesley Stahl in the passenger seat. Musk kept his hands off the wheel and told Stahl that he was \"not doing anything,\" while the car was driving itself. However, Tesla's owners manuals specify that drivers should not use FSD (Supervised) features without paying attention to the road.In filings with California's OAH, lawyers for the state's DMV wrote that Tesla's marketing for \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" falsely suggested the cars are capable of operating autonomously. Tesla's attorneys alleged that the DMV never proved consumers in the state had been confused about whether its cars were safe to drive without a human at the wheel.When Tesla used those brand names, the company's attorneys argued, \"It was impossible to buy a Tesla equipped with either Autopilot or Full Self-Driving Capability, or to use any of their associated features, without seeing clear and repeated statements that they do not make the vehicle autonomous.\"In a separate class-action lawsuit that's winding its way through California courts, customers who purchased FSD expecting their cars to be upgraded into robotaxi-ready vehicles over time are asking for their money back. Tesla was also held partly liable for a fatal crash involving Autopilot. During the trial, the Tesla owner said he had dropped his phone while driving and scrambled to pick it up, but thought the car's Enhanced Autopilot system would brake if an obstacle was in the way. The suit resulted in a $243 million verdict against Tesla to be paid to the family of the deceased and an injured survivor of the crash.WATCH: Nancy Tengler says Tesla is still a generational opportunitywatch now",

    "body": "This aerial view shows a cargo ship sailing out of the Panama Canal on the Pacific side in Panama City on October 6, 2025.Martin Bernetti | Afp | Getty ImagesPanama annulled key port contracts held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in its official gazette Monday, transferring interim operations of the ports to Danish shipping giants A.P. Moller-Maersk and Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Co.The notice formalized a Supreme Court ruling last month that the concessions for the Balboa and Cristobal terminals near the Panama Canal, which Panama Port Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, had held for more than two decades, were unconstitutional.The Panamanian government on Monday formally assumed control of the port facilities, including cranes, vehicles, computer systems and software under a decree aimed at ensuring uninterrupted operations until a new concession is awarded within 18 months.  Under the interim arrangement, APM Terminals, a unit of Maersk, will operate the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal, while MSC's port operating subsidiary, Terminal Investment, will run the Cristobal port on the Atlantic side.Shares of CK Hutchison fell 0.9% at the open Tuesday. The stock has climbed over 20% so far this year.In a statement to CNBC Tuesday, CK Hutchison said PPC had ceased all operations at the terminals on both sides of the canal on Monday, while describing the executive decree \"unlawful.\"   The Hong Kong conglomerate said it would continue to consult legal advisors regarding the ruling and takeover.CNBC reached out to Maersk and MSC for comment but did not receive a response by publication.watch nowThe simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfire.After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was \"running the Panama Canal,\" CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port assets. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  \"kowtowing\" to American pressure and stalling the transaction. The Hong Kong conglomerate has pushed back since the ruling last month and initiated arbitration proceedings against Panama. On Feb. 12, CK Hutchison said that \"any steps\" that Maersk or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely \"result in legal recourse.\" Beijing also warned that the Central American country will \"pay a heavy price both politically and economically\" unless it changes course.The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities. China has reportedly directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and urged shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week.— CNBC's Emily Chan contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) gives a thumbs up as he arrives for a House Republican Conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol on September 10, 2024 in Washington, DC.Kent Nishimura | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump says he does not need Congress to impose tariffs, but his recent attempts to impose new import duties could trigger difficult votes for Republicans ahead of midterms. And Democrats are vowing to disrupt attempts to extend Trump's trade policy.Shortly after the Supreme Court spiked a majority of Trump's tariffs on Friday, the president doubled-down and issued another round using Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act. That statute caps rates at 15% and requires congressional authorization for an extension beyond 150 days, creating the potential for a difficult vote on an unpopular issue for congressional Republicans in the midst of election season.\"I'm freaked out about it. Because every poll shows that American voters are against tariffs at a 2-to-1 ratio. The president has latched on to a very unpopular policy,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of six Republicans who voted earlier this month to strike down Trump's 35% tariff on Canadian imports.The Supreme Court's decision, which struck down tariffs Trump issued using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, dealt a massive blow to Trump's economic agenda and could change the dynamics of the fight in Congress over the president's signature trade policy.Democrats have tried to connect Trump's tariffs to affordability — and the role they say tariffs have played in rising prices — as they map out a plan to continue fighting Trump's tariff agenda in the coming months.\"Senate Democrats will continue to fight back against Trump's tariff tax, and will block any attempt to extend these harmful tariffs when they expire this summer. Democrats will not go along with furthering Trump's economic carnage,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y., said in a statement on Monday.While Democrats hold little power without control in the House or Senate, the success of any future vote to extend his Section 122 tariffs or expand the president's power to impose his trade policy is far from certain as GOP frustration builds.\"In a razor-thin House majority, that legal rebuke gives Republicans more cover to break ranks, especially on issues with direct economic consequences for their districts,\" said Brittany Martinez, executive director at Principles First who worked for Speaker Kevin McCarthy. \"As we move toward the midterms, we're likely to see more members prioritize the rule of law and local impact over party pressure.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday acknowledged the dim prospects for tariffs in Congress. \"It's going to be, I think, a challenge to find consensus on any path forward on the tariffs on the legislative side. That is why I think you see so much of the attention on the executive side,\" Johnson told reporters at the Capitol, according to MSNOW.New pushback to Trump on tradeThe House vote to overturn Trump's Canada tariffs, while symbolic, was the latest in a series of hits to Trump's trade policies. The Senate had voted multiple times in the last year to similarly strike some of the president's IEEPA tariffs. \"I was in the cloakroom and I heard people saying 'I don't like tariffs but I voted no,'\" Bacon said, recalling the night of the House vote. \"I expect that if people were left to their own devices, without pressure, I think the number would have been five or six times higher. But obviously it's a big priority for the president, so people struggle with it.\"  Some of the GOP defectors, like Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., framed their opposition as a win for checks and balances. \"Last week's vote by Congress and today's Supreme Court decision represents precisely that give-and-take envisioned by the Founders,\" Kiley posted to X on Friday.Bacon, who is retiring from Congress at the end of his term, pointed to a recent Tax Foundation study that said Trump's tariffs amounted to a $1,000 average tax increase for American families in 2025. He also cited analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that found U.S. consumers and firms are shouldering nearly 90% of the tariff burden. Both should be \"red flags,\" he said.But any perceived act of defiance against the president could have consequences. Trump over the weekend withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Jeff Hurd, a Colorado Republican who voted to overturn Trump's Canada tariffs. Hurd faces right-wing primary opponent Hope Scheppelman, who Trump is now endorsing.\"When I took office, I swore an oath to the Constitution and to the people I serve. Every vote I cast is guided by what is best for this district and the long-term strength of our country,\" Hurd posted to X the day after Trump's attack.Tariffs could be 'hard sell' in election yearHow obedient will the congressional GOP be to Trump in an election year? Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., introduced the Canada tariffs disapproval resolution and had planned to force additional votes to strike down other of Trump's import duties.The Supreme Court decision changed that strategy, but Meeks said future votes on the topic of tariffs generally could go poorly for Trump.\"I think that that will only be a continuing result as we move forward and continue to look at what Trump is doing, because what he's doing is hurting the American people,\" Meeks said. Bacon predicted that bipartisan efforts to legislatively reassert Congress' constitutional authority over tariffs could gain steam, pointing to a bill he introduced last year, which as of Monday had eight bipartisan cosponsors. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash, led a companion in the Senate, which has 13 cosponsors, also a bipartisan group.On Monday, a group of Senate Democrats, led by Ron Wyden of Oregon, released legislation that would force Customs and Border Patrol to issue tariff refunds to importers and small businesses. Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., introduced similar legislation in the House on Friday, though neither has a clear path to passage as long as Democrats are in the minority.Asked if refunds should be issued, Johnson on Monday said \"I don't think so. The White House is going to sort that out.\"Republicans in theory have latitude to expand Trump's tariff authority or legislatively impose import duties. Some, like Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, suggested Republicans \"get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\"But \"patience is wearing thin on the tariff front,\" John Feehery, a Republican strategist at EFB Advocacy and a former aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said in an interview last week. \"It's a pretty hard sell if you're from a farm state or a place that exports equipment overseas,\" Feehery said.",

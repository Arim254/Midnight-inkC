    "body": "Celsopupo | Istock | Getty ImagesWall Street is finding an unexpected beneficiary of America's weight loss boom: airlines.With the first GLP-1 weight loss drug now available in pill form, analysts at Jefferies say broad adoption across society could quietly lower fuel bills — airlines' single largest cost — and lift earnings for the carriers. \"A slimmer society = lower fuel consumption. Airlines have a history of being vigilant around aircraft weight savings, from olives (pitless, of course) to paper stock,\" the Wall Street firm said in a note to clients.Jefferies contended that a 10% reduction in average passenger weight could translate into roughly 2% total aircraft weight savings, up to 1.5% lower fuel costs and as much as a 4% boost to earnings per share.Patients are already getting their hands on the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk, and a similar product from Eli Lilly isn't far behind, with U.S. approval expected within months. By eliminating the need for self-injection, pills are widely expected to attract first-time patients to obesity treatments.  Earnings GainsJefferies estimates the implications could be material for the largest U.S. carriers, led by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines.Collectively, the four carriers are expected to burn about 16 billion gallons of fuel in 2026 at an average fuel price of $2.41 a gallon, according to Jefferies. That puts their combined fuel bill at nearly $39 billion, accounting for nearly 19% of total operating expenses.Assuming a 1% reduction in aircraft weight improves fuel efficiency by 0.75%, the investment bank estimates a 2% decline in average passenger weight could translate into roughly 4% upside to earnings per share across the group. That equals potential EPS gains of about 2.8% for Delta, 3.5% for United, 4.2% for Southwest and as much as 11.7% for American, which has more operating leverage to fuel costs.Weight is one of the most important drivers of fuel efficiency, a point aircraft manufacturers including  Boeing routinely emphasize. When Boeing delivers an aircraft, there is a fixed \"operating empty weight,\" with the remaining allowance up to the maximum takeoff weight split among fuel, passengers, baggage and cargo, Jefferies noted.Jefferies used a 737 Max 8 as an example. The aircraft has an operating empty weight of about 99,000 pounds, with capacity for roughly 46,000 pounds of fuel and 36,000 pounds of payload. Assuming a two-class configuration with 178 passengers at an average weight of 180 pounds, passengers account for around 32,000 pounds.If average passenger weight declined by 10%, total passenger weight would fall by about 3,200 pounds or  roughly 2% of maximum takeoff weight, delivering meaningful fuel savings over thousands of flights per year, Jefferies said. The industry's fixation on weight is well documented. In 2018, United Airlines switched its Hemisphere magazine to lighter paper, trimming about an ounce per copy, a move expected to save 170,000 gallons of fuel annually, worth roughly $290,000 at the time, Jefferies noted.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

The measure, known as a war powers resolution, advanced in a procedural vote last week after five Republican senators joined with Democrats to vote for it — a stunning defeat for Trump after he ordered a strike that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.In the days since, the White House has engaged in a furious lobbying effort to kill the measure.

After it advanced last week, he said the group of five that voted for it should never be elected to office again.The measure would likely be largely symbolic, as it would have to survive a Trump veto even if it advances from the Senate and the Republican-controlled House. A two-thirds majority is needed in both the House and Senate to override a veto, while the resolution is only subject to a simple majority threshold. This story is developing.

    "body": "A home with a \"Sold\" sign from a real estate company in North Patchogue, New York.Steve Pfost | Newsday | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes in December rose to a seasonally-adjusted, annualized rate of 4.35 million units, a 5.1% increase from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was higher than analysts' expectations for a gain of 2%. Sales were 1.4% higher than a year earlier. For the full year, there were 4.06 million existing home sales, unchanged from 2024.After adjusting for seasonal factors, December sales were the strongest in nearly three years. Sales increased in all regions month-over-month and were higher annually in the Northeast and Midwest, but lower in the South and West. This count is based on closings, so sales contracts likely signed in October and November, when mortgage rates weren't moving much. The average rate on the 30-year fixed loan hovered between 6.2% and 6.3% during that time. That rate, however, was lower than it was last spring and summer, when it was closer to 7%.\"2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for The Realtors, in a release. \"However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory was the big headline of the monthly report. There were 1.18 million units available for sale at the end of December, down 18% from November, although 3.5% higher year-over-year. With stronger sales, that dropped the supply to just 3.3 months, which is considered quite lean. Low supply kept prices in positive territory, although just barely. The median price of a home sold in December was $405,400, up 0.4% annually and the 30th straight month of annual gains. The increase, however, was smaller than the 1.2% gain in November. \"With fewer sellers feeling eager to move, homeowners are taking their time deciding when to list or delist their homes. Similar to past years, more inventory is expected to come to market beginning in February,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage demand spiked markedly higher last week as consumers returned from the holidays to find overall lower interest rates and then a sharp rate drop Friday on news from the White House. President Donald Trump posted on social media late Thursday that, in an effort to lower mortgage rates, he would order mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. Just on that news, the average rate on the 30-year fixed sunk briefly below 6% on Friday morning before bouncing slightly higher again, according to Mortgage News Daily. As a result, total mortgage application volume jumped 28.5% last week from the previous week, which was adjusted for the holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. For the whole week, on the MBA's survey, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.18% from 6.25%, with points falling to 0.56 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Rates started to come down a little just before that, and part of it might be a bounce back from the holidays, even though we did adjust for the holiday in the results the week before. It's always a noisy time,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, adding, \"This was a real move based upon the rate drop. Spreads had been moving in even before the announcement.\"Refinance demand, which is most sensitive to daily rate changes, surged 40% higher for the week and was 128% higher than the same week one year ago.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home, which are less sensitive to sudden rate changes,  rose 16% for the week and were 13% higher than the same week one year ago. The increase there was probably driven more just by people returning from the holidays, easing home prices and more inventory available for sale.Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, according to Mortgage News Daily. They bounced Monday on the expectation of higher oil prices and then a little higher Tuesday. \"Things might have ended up worse today had it not been for a reasonably well-received CPI report (Consumer Price Index),\" wrote Matthew Graham, COO of Mortgage News Daily, on Tuesday. \"This important data showed inflation remaining in check in December, with the most closely-watched metrics coming in just below the median forecast.\"",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Under the current deal, shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer, Faber reported. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added.If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported.The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery's business. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30 per share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV networks. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. ",

    "body": "watch nowSaks Global, the parent company behind the 159-year-old department store that's become both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday after an unsustainable debt pile crushed its business. The company also announced former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck will immediately take over as chief executive, replacing Richard Baker. He had been in the job for just two weeks, but had been involved with Saks since Hudson's Bay acquired it in 2013 when he was CEO of the Canadian department store. With van Raemdonck comes a revamped senior leadership team stacked with veterans from Neiman Marcus, which Saks Global acquired in 2024. Darcy Penick, who served as the president of Bergdorf Goodman before Saks bought the department store, will take over as president and chief commercial officer for Saks Global. Lana Todorovich, Neiman's former chief merchandising officer, has been named chief of global brand partnerships. Ahead of the filing, Saks secured $1.75 billion in new financing from a group of the company's senior secured bondholders and asset-based lenders. The lion's share, $1 billion, is debtor-in-possession financing that will be used to fund operations while the company is in Chapter 11 while an additional $500 million will be available to the company after it emerges from bankruptcy, which it said it expects to do later this year. Its asset-based lenders provided an additional $240 million in incremental liquidity. The flush of new money comes after Saks struggled to line up DIP financing, which will be used to keep the business running during Chapter 11 proceedings, CNBC previously reported. Without it, Saks faced the prospect of liquidation, which could've spelled the end for one of the most fabled department stores in history. Shoppers walk outside the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., Jan. 6, 2026. Angelina Katsanis | ReutersA bankruptcy filing for Saks Global has been seen as inevitable for weeks after the company missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month. What is still unclear is what will happen to the company and the nearly 200 doors under its umbrella across Saks' namesake stores and its off-price chain, along with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. In a news release, the company said its \"evaluating its operational footprint\" to put its resources where it sees the \"greatest long-term potential.\" That likely means a trimmed down store fleet in the coming months to reduce the company's fixed costs. \"This is a defining moment for Saks Global, and the path ahead presents a meaningful opportunity to strengthen the foundation of our business and position it for the future,\" CEO van Raemdonck said in a news release. \"In close partnership with these newly appointed leaders and our colleagues across the organization, we will navigate this process together with a continued focus on serving our customers and luxury brands. I look forward to serving as CEO and continuing to transform the Company so that Saks Global continues to play a central role in shaping the future of luxury retail.\"How did Saks fall apart? Though it caters to some of the wealthiest shoppers in the world, Saks has been steadily running out of cash and failing to pay some of its bills after it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal heavily financed with debt. Still, Saks was struggling to pay its vendors even before it acquired Neiman. Through the acquisition, the company received a flood of new money that was supposed to deleverage the combined business and provide it with \"significant liquidity,\" Saks said at the time. The tie-up brought a fresh slate of deep-pocketed investors from the tech world, including Amazon and Salesforce, and was expected to create a luxury department store powerhouse with an improved cost structure and stronger negotiating power. Instead, Saks failed to implement the turnaround investors had banked on. It briefly got better at paying its vendors, but then moved to a 90-day payment term, angering and pushing away brands that said the conditions were too onerous to work for their businesses. Soon, it stopped paying suppliers once again, which led to both a dip in assortment and sales. In the backdrop, Saks' debt began trading below its face value, raising questions about the company's ability to keep operations running and make interest payments to bondholders, people familiar with the matter said, who spoke anonymously because the discussions were private. Over the summer, it secured $600 million in new financing and sold off key real estate assets to drum up more cash.While those efforts bought the company some time, they ultimately didn't prevent a bankruptcy filing.",

    "body": "Silver bars appear in a photo illustration as silver prices move amid shifting industrial demand and global market volatility in Brussels, Belgium, on December 24, 2025. Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares linked to silver strengthened on Wednesday, after the metal hit another record high and held above the $90 threshold.On Tuesday, spot silver — which outperformed gold last year with a 150% annual gain — crossed over the $90-an-ounce mark for the first time. It was more than 5.8% higher at $92.03 per ounce by 8:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silver priceSilver futures for March delivery, meanwhile, were last seen trading at $91.895. Spot prices for the metal are up 27% so far this year and, as the rally continued, equities related to the metal moved higher. In pre-market trade, U.S.-listed shares of Hecla Mining — which owns Greens Creek Mine in Alaska, one of the biggest silver mines in the world — jumped 4.2%. Endeavour Silver was 2.5% higher, while First Majestic Silver was last seen trading up 2.7%. Coeur Mining, the operator of the Rochester mine in Nevada, gained around 2.6%, while Silvercorp Metals and Teck Resources added 3%, and Wheaton Precious Metals gained 1%.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the silver industry also rallied. The Abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF rose by 6.3% in pre-market trade, while the iShares Silver Trust fund also jumped 6.3%. ProShares' Ultra Silver ETF surged 12.7% higher. Across the Atlantic, London-listed shares of Fresnillo touched a record high and were last seen trading 1.9% higher. The stock was the best performer on London's FTSE 100 index last year, with a gain of 452.5%. Evy Hambro, portfolio manager and the Global Head of Thematics and Sector Investing at BlackRock, told CNBC on Tuesday that although the investment management giant had long been bullish on silver, it had only begun shifting its approach to equities related to the metal in recent years. \"It was only in 2024 that we moved into the [related] equities as prices had risen to levels that allowed the companies to make a decent return,\" he said in an email. \"Prior to this, price moves had more often than not been eaten up by cost increases.\"BlackRock expects silver to continue its upward trajectory this year.\"Our long-term view on silver is positive, but it is important to remember silver is more of an industrial metal [than gold],\" Hambro told CNBC. \"We expect 2026 returns to be driven by how company management teams allocate the increased cashflows. Should there be ongoing discipline, such as massive dividend increases rather than over investment or M&A, this will differentiate miners in 2026.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, told CNBC on Wednesday that underlying factors supporting the silver rally were still at play. \"It's been a whirlwind time for silver and there are reasons why the metal could still shine well into 2026,\" he said in an email. \"Supplies are tight and could get even tighter after China imposed export restrictions on the refined version of the precious metal. That matters because China is a net exporter of silver.\"He also pointed to silver's industrial use as a driver of demand, with the metal being an essential component in goods from solar panels to cell phones.  \"Demand is strong from these areas, and there is a risk that not enough money is being spent by miners on developing new sources of supply,\" Coatsworth said. When it comes to allocating capital to silver, Coatsworth added that investors can gain exposure through funds or shares in miners as well as buying physical silver. \"Buying a fund is a way to get broad exposure and spread your risks, rather than betting everything on a single company,\" he said. \"However, investing in any silver mining company – either directly or through a fund – is higher risk than simply tracking the silver price. You must factor in the risks that operations go wrong, geopolitical risks associated with the location of assets, and unpredictable geology.\"",

Here's what the company reported:Adjusted earnings: $1.81 per share vs. $1.67 expected, according to LSEGAdjusted revenue: $21.0 billion vs. $20.72 billion expectedCitigroup said net income fell 13% from the year-earlier period to $2.47 billion, or $1.19 per share, because of a $1.1 billion after-tax loss tied its plan to divest Citigroup's Russian operations.Excluding the charge, profit was $3.6 billion, or $1.81 per share.Revenue excluding the Russia-related charge rose 8% to $21.0 billion on increases in banking, wealth and institutional services results.Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and investments and what it pays depositors, rose 14% to $15.67 billion, or roughly $815 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.The bank's loan loss provision in the quarter was $2.2 billion, about $330 million below expectations.At Citigroup and rival firms including Bank of America, lower-than-expected loan loss provisions may signal optimism about the economy and the ability of borrowers to repay their debts.\"With record revenues and positive operating leverage for each of our five businesses, 2025 was a year of significant progress as we demonstrated that the investments we are making are driving strong top-line growth,\" CEO Jane Fraser said in the earnings release.\"We enter 2026 with visible momentum across the firm,\" Fraser said.The company is \"committed\" to reaching its returns target of at least 10% for 2026 and positioning the bank for \"improved returns above that level in the years ahead,\" she added.Shares of the bank fell more than 4% in afternoon trading. Under Fraser, Citigroup is in the midst of a restructuring, selling off parts of its overseas operations, while also benefiting from U.S. banking deregulation. Those are the reasons Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo calls Citigroup his top pick among bank stocks.Analysts will be keen to hear whether Fraser sees momentum from last year carrying over into 2026.

Bank of America and Wells Fargo also released Q4 results Wednesday, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are scheduled for Thursday. This story is developing. Please check back for updates.",

Here's what the company reported:Earnings: 98 cents per share vs. 96 cents expected, according to LSEG  Revenue: $28.53 billion vs. $27.94 billion expectedThe company said profit rose 12% from a year earlier to $7.6 billion, or 98 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7.1% to $28.53 billion, thanks to rising net interest income, asset management fees and trading revenue.Shares of the bank fell more than 3% in early trading. \"With consumers and businesses proving resilient, as well as the regulatory environment and tax and trade policies coming into sharper focus, we expect further economic growth in the year ahead,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the release. \"While any number of risks continue, we are bullish on the U.S. economy in 2026.\"Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and securities and what it pays depositors for their savings, rose 9.7% to $15.92 billion in the quarter.

Equities trading revenue rose 23% to $2.02 billion, or about $160 million more than expected. Fixed income trading revenue edged up by 1.5% to $2.52 billion, or about $120 million below what analysts had forecast for the quarter.Fees generated by the firm's investment bankers were roughly flat from a year ago at $1.67 billion, nearly matching the StreetAccount estimate.The lender got a boost from a smaller-than-expected provision for loan losses in the quarter of $1.31 billion, about $190 million lower than analysts had forecast. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets after JPMorgan Chase, has been a beneficiary of the industry's recent tail winds. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit, and deregulation have all helped the lender, whose shares rose 25% last year.Analysts will want to hear more from Moynihan as to whether momentum will carry into 2026.On Tuesday, JPMorgan posted results that exceeded expectations on better-than-expected trading revenue.

The feature, called Personal Intelligence, is available for personal accounts, Google said in a blog post Wednesday. \"Whether it's connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched or finding nuance in your photo library, Gemini now understands context without being told where to look,\" Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and the Gemini app, wrote in the post. It's Google's latest attempt to build more reasoning AI capabilities within its Gemini app and lure users as the company goes head-to-head with OpenAI and others in the increasingly competitive generative AI market. While Gemini could already retrieve information from Google apps, the company said Wednesday that Gemini 3 can now \"reason across your data to surface proactive insights.\"The new feature will compete with Apple Intelligence, Apple's personal AI system that integrates apps to help with writing, image creation and understanding context. Apple said Monday it chose Google to power  its AI features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. Personal Intelligence will first be available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S., the company said, and will be added to Google's search tool \"AI Mode\" in the future. The feature will be off by default, Google said. Woodward, who has launched successful products in Gemini in the past year, warned that the beta version of the new feature hasn't eliminated mistakes, and is asking users to give feedback. \"Gemini may also struggle with timing or nuance, particularly regarding relationship changes, like divorces, or your various interests,\" he wrote. For sensitive topics like health, \"Gemini aims to avoid making proactive assumptions\" but \"will discuss this data with you if you ask,\" Woodward added.Woodward also said the company doesn't train its AI models \"directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library\" but does utilize \"limited info, like specific prompts in Gemini and the model's responses, to improve functionality over time.\"WATCH: Google unveils 'Gemini 3 Flash' AI model focused on speed and costwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

    "body": "Hobo_018 | E+ | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said in December that this spring may be the \"largest tax refund season of all time,\" due to changes in the \"big beautiful bill.\" But student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments may miss out. That's because the U.S. Department of Education can seize a borrower's entire tax refund — including their child tax credit or earned income tax credit — if they're in default on their federal student debt. Around 9 million education loan holders are currently in a default status, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization. The Trump administration announced in April that it would resume Education Department collections activity, after a roughly five-year pause that began during the Covid pandemic. Some borrowers reported having their refunds seized last year, but this will be the first full tax season in which collections on student loan debt are back in force, experts said. In addition to seizing tax refunds, the federal government can also garnish the wages and Social Security benefits of people who owe it money. Tax season is \"a heartbreaking time of year\" for many student loan holders, said Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit. \"Many borrowers in default are struggling financially in other areas and often count on their refunds to catch up on other bills such as rent or car payments,\" Mayotte said. \"Finding out their entire refund has been taken can be a severe blow.\" Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMore Americans expect to miss a debt payment: What that does to your credit scoreStudent loan borrowers in default may miss Trump's 'largest tax refund season'IRS could see modest budget cut as Congress proposes funding plansAs enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, millions poised to drop health insuranceBigger tax refunds are coming for 2026 — what it could mean for the economyHere's the inflation breakdown for December 2025 — in one chartMore drivers have $1,000-plus car loan payments.

Here's what to know. Learn if your tax refund is at risk Borrowers worried about the fate of their tax refund should first make sure they know exactly how far behind they are, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\"You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default,\" Nierman said. \"Borrowers may think they are in default, but you have to miss at least nine months of payments before your loans are moved to this status.\"You can log into your account at Studentaid.gov to see how far behind you are; a pink banner on your dashboard may show up if your debt has officially reached default.    \"If you are delinquent but not yet in default, explore all your repayment options,\" Nierman said. \"You may     be eligible for a more affordable payment plan based on your income.\" Enrolling in a forbearance or deferment should also stave off collection activity for a period, she added. If you do learn that you're in default, contact the government's Treasury Offset Program's call center at 1-800-304-3107, said Kyra Taylor, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Borrowers in default \"need to call right before they file their taxes,\" Taylor said. The government generates a list of people who are in debt to different agencies and may have their tax refunds garnished. You'll be asked to provide your Social Security number to learn if you are on the list, Taylor said. \"If their name is not on the list, they're likely in the clear,\" she said. If you are on the list for garnishment, you'll want to take steps right away to get current on your loans — and ideally before you file your taxes, Taylor said. Get current on student loans before filing taxesGetting current on your student loans or taking steps to do so may stop the government from seizing your tax refund. But it can take between 30 days and 10 months to get out of default, so some borrowers may consider requesting an extension to file their tax return, Taylor said. Doing so is easy and free, and automatically extends your deadline to file federal taxes from April 15 to Oct. 15.(Borrowers who aren't sure if they'll owe taxes or receive a refund may benefit from preparing a mock return before the April 15 deadline. \"Filing an extension does not extend the time to pay taxes owed,\" said Kathleen Boyd, a certified financial planner and founder of Student Loan Savvy. If you do have a tax obligation, you'll need to pay by the original deadline to avoid incurring interest and penalties, she said.)You are not subject to collections unless your debt is actually in default.Nancy Niermanassistant director at EDCAP Applying for a loan consolidation is typically the fastest way to get out of default, Taylor said. The process can be completed in as little as four weeks, she added. But some defaulted borrowers may be required to make several on-time payments before they can consolidate, and not all borrowers will qualify, including some who've already consolidated their loans or are facing wage garnishment. Consolidating your loans, which involves repackaging your federal student debts into a new federal student loan, can also lead you to lose progress on your forgiveness timeline under some repayment plans, Taylor said. Borrowers may also lose out on current repayment options if the consolidation wraps up after June, due to Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" Another way to get out of default is through a loan rehabilitation. That process involves making \"nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education. Those nine payments can be made over \"a period of 10 consecutive months,\" it notes on the StudentAid.gov site.If you can't finish the agreement before filing your taxes, you can try contacting your loan servicer and asking if they'll stop collection anyway, Taylor said. They may agree to do so if you start rehabilitation not long after receiving a notice of default or if you've already made five rehabilitation payments. After taking these steps, Taylor recommends calling the Treasury hotline back before submitting your taxes. If your name is no longer on the garnishment list, you can file with more peace of mind. ",

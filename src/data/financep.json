    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesU.S. cybersecurity company F5 closed down 10% on Thursday after disclosing a system breach in which a \"highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor\" gained long-term access to some systems.The stock had its worst day since April 27, 2022, when the stock fell 12.8%.The company disclosed the breach in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday and said the hack affected its BIG-IP product development environment. F5 said the attacker infiltrated files containing some source code and information on \"undisclosed vulnerabilities\" in BIG-IP.The breach was later attributed to state-backed hackers from China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.F5, which was made aware of the attack in August, said they have not seen evidence of any new unauthorized activity.Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJ\"We have no knowledge of undisclosed critical or remote code vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of active exploitation of any undisclosed F5 vulnerabilities,\" F5 said in a statement.The cybersecurity giant told customers that hackers were in the network for at least 12 months and that the breach used a malware called Brickstorm, according to Bloomberg.F5 would not confirm the information.Brickstorm is attributed to a suspected China-nexus threat dubbed UNC5221, Google Threat Intelligence Group said in a blog post. The malware is used for maintaining \"long-term stealthy access\" and can remain undetected in victim systems for an average of 393 days, according to Mandiant.The attack prompted an emergency directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, telling all agencies using F5 software or products to apply the latest update.\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors demands immediate and decisive action from all federal agencies,\" CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend to any organization using this technology, potentially leading to a catastrophic compromise of critical information systems.\"The UK's National Cyber Security Centre also issued guidance for the F5 attack, advising customers to install security updates and continue monitoring for threats.",

    "body": "Michelle Bowman, vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve, during the Federal Reserve Board Community Bank Conference in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. Eric Lee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRegulators are doing away with controversial rules that required banks to plan for losses in the event of climate-related events, according to an announcement Thursday.A joint release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve said they no longer believe the requirements are necessary as they are redundant with other provisions banks make to plan for emergencies and unusual events.\"The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities,\" a joint release from the three regulators said.Fed Governor Michael Barr, the former vice chair for supervision, issued a statement disagreeing with the move.\"Rescinding the principles is shortsighted and will make the financial system riskier even as climate-related financial risks grow,\" Barr said in a statement.Mission creepTrump administration officials have criticized the Fed for falling prey to mission creep, or exceeding the scope of its mandates for monetary policy and bank supervision. The climate change provisions, established in October 2023, were one point of criticism.Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that climate is not a direct Fed issue. The rules required banks, as part of routine testing, to list potential losses they might suffer from climate-related issues.Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee who succeeded Barr as the Fed banking supervisor, praised the move rescinding the rules as part of an attempt at \"refocusing the supervisory process on material financial risk.\"\"Rescission of the climate principles is an important step in this process,\" Bowman said. She criticized the climate rules, saying \"the effect of this guidance was to create confusion about supervisory expectations and increase compliance cost and burden without a commensurate improvement to the safety and soundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States.\"While acknowledging the risks that climate change poses, Bowman said the Fed's mission does \"not extend to climate policymaking.\"",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration imposing a $100,000 fee to the H-1B worker visas.Last month President Donald Trump announced plans that would see U.S. companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas -- which allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations in various fields, including technology and engineering -- in an attempt to rework the program.In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it \"overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\"\"The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,\" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years. The program is capped at 65,000 visas per year, with an additional carve out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees. Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.The administration has also proposed further changes to the H-1B program's lottery selection system.The changes have come in the months following Trump entering office and amid a push to limit immigration and see American companies hire more domestically.\"President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,\" Bradley said in the Thursday release.",

Alex Wong | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said the federal government shutdown could hurt bookings if it continues.Despite the funding impasse, essential federal employees including Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers are required to work without pay. The shutdown started Oct. 1 as Congress failed to pass a funding bill.Speaking on an earnings call on Thursday, Kirby said the shutdown so far hasn't impacted the carrier's business.\"I think that at least for the first couple of weeks, people thought it was going to get resolved, so they just kind of continued business as usual,\" he said. \"But as time goes on, as people read headlines and say, 'it's not going to get resolved soon.' People start to lose confidence in the government and the government's ability to resolve this. And that's going to start to impact bookings.\"Kirby said there isn't an exact cutoff for when the airline could start to see an impact, but added \"every day that goes by, the risk to the U.S. economy grows. So I hope we will avoid an unforced error here.\"Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian last week made a similar warning about how a prolonged shutdown could affect air travel but emphasized that the airline's operation hadn't been affected.The shutdown has raised concerns about already thin-staffing among air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks with CNBC during the Invest i America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.CNBCFederal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller provided conflicting views on how quickly the central bank should lower interest rates in the face of a weakening labor market and heightened geopolitical tensions.Miran said Thursday he plans to repeat his push for a half percentage point interest rate cut when the Fed meets later this month.In a speech delivered in New York, Waller advocated a quarter percentage point reduction at the October meeting, a position that appears more in line with the Fed consensus.Taken together and combined with recent statements from other monetary policymakers, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee looks to be on a clear path to more reductions, the extent to which remains unclear.\"Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I believe that the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points at our meeting that concludes Oct. 29,\" Waller told the Council on Foreign Relations. \"But beyond that point, I will be looking for how the solid GDP data reconcile with the softening labor market.\"Fed officials have been operating in a quandary between indications of a standstill in hiring against nagging inflation pressures exacerbated by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Waller has been among officials advocating an approach in which the Fed looks through the tariffs as one-off price increases that will not provide lasting inflationary pressures.Waller pointed to two scenarios — one in which gross domestic product continues its upward climb and the labor market improves, in which case the Fed would need a more cautious approach on cutting, and the other in which the economic picture darkens and additional rate cuts on the order of up to 1.25 percentage points are necessary.\"What I would want to avoid is rekindling inflationary pressure by moving too quickly and squandering the significant progress we have made taming inflation,\" he said. \"The labor market has been sending some clear warnings lately, and we should be ready to act if those warnings are validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and months.\"'It should be 50'Both Waller and Miran were appointed by President Donald Trump. Waller is considered one of the final front-runners to succeed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026.In separate remarks, Miran conceded he still expects his colleagues to vote for another quarter-point reduction even as he thinks current circumstances warrant a more aggressive approach.\"My view is that it should be 50\" basis points, he said during a Fox Business interview. \"However, I expect it to be an additional 25 and I think that we're probably set up for three 25 basis point cuts this year, for a total of 75 basis points this year.\"One basis point equals 0.01%, so 50 would be the equivalent of half a percentage point. Miran pushed for a half-point cut at the September meeting but was outvoted 11-1 on the Federal Open Market Committee.Earlier this week, Powell indicated that a softening labor market kept the door open to additional easing. Participants at the September meeting indicated the likelihood of two more moves coming this year, though Miran favored an approach that would lop a total 1.25 percentage points off the fed funds rate by the end of 2025.A government shutdown that has blocked the issuance of most key data points has made the Fed's job tougher.\"It would be really helpful to have the economic data in order to be able to make the decisions we need to make,\" Miran said. \"Certainly, we would want to be inspecting the economy for signs of moves lower in inflation, for signs of changes in the job market. But without those data, we still have to make a decision anyway, and so we'll have to rely upon our forecasts for doing so.\"Miran said economic growth largely looks \"OK for most of this year\" though he is concerned about the recent acceleration in tensions between the U.S. and China, which he sees as boosting the case for big rate cuts.The FOMC next meets Oct. 28-29, with markets pricing in a nearly 100% of a quarter-point reduction.",

    "body": "Jefferies headquarters in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023.Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStock Chart IconStock chart iconZION and KRE, 1-dayThe bankruptcies of two auto industry-related companies this year have raised concerns about loose lending practices, especially in the opaque private credit market. That's left both the banking industry and investors concerned about whether instances of loans gone wrong indicate a burgeoning crisis.The latest signs of trouble came when Zions said Wednesday evening it faced a sizable charge because of bad loans to a couple of borrowers. Despite expecting this was an isolated incident, the bank said that it will encourage its counsel to have an independent review.Western Alliance then alleged Thursday a borrower had committed fraud. That rattled investors despite the company saying it could reaffirm its guidance and 2025 outlook.\"While  we  are  questioning  why  all  of  these  credit  'one offs'  are  seemingly occurring in a short period of time, the reality is that even though these exposures may be 'well-contained' and have a 'limited financial impact,' this is an industry where investors — especially those that are new to this sector — tend to 'sell first and ask questions later,' especially when it comes to elevated credit concerns,\" JPMorgan banking analyst Anthony Elian wrote in a Thursday note to clients.Looking for 'cockroaches'The worries about the health of the banking industry originated with the bankruptcies of companies related to the auto sector: First Brands and Tricolor Holdings.Auto parts maker First Brands went bankrupt last month and announced this week that founder Patrick James stepped down as chief executive. The Ohio-based company is facing a Justice Department criminal investigation, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Shares of Jefferies, which has exposure to First Brands, fell more than 10% on Thursday. The investment bank's stock has lost more 25% in October, making it poised to record its worst month since the Covid pandemic took hold in March 2020.Jefferies said that hedge funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies tied to First Brands, while UBS said that it has about $500 million in exposure.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on the company's earnings conference call earlier this week in relation to First Brands and Tricolor Holdings fallout.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJEF, 1-monthJPMorgan did not have exposure to First Brands, but did take a $170 million charge-off last quarter from Tricolor.\"I asked Jamie Dimon the question about these problems, and you heard, when you see one cockroach, there's probably a few more,\" said Mike Mayo, senior banking analyst at Wells Fargo. \"Investors are looking around for cockroaches. That's what's happening.\"An 'opaque' marketMayo said credit quality in the overall industry is still considered favorable. However, he said the recent developments show the low margin for error when there's hiccups in the credit market.Additionally, because the private credit market is so \"opaque,\" there can be a \"major wave of concern without really knowing if there is even a problem,\" said Peter Corey of Pave Finance.This week's lending revelations mark the latest challenge in recent years for regional banks. The industry went through a crisis in 2023 that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Alternative and other asset managers also suffered in the Thursday downdraft resulting from concern about the health of some loans.Blue Owl Capital dropped more than 7%, while Ares Management and Blackstone fell more than 6% and 3%, respectively. Apollo Global Management lost more than 5% and Carlyle Group declined around 4%.To be sure, the declines in major banks were relatively subdued Thursday. JPMorgan shed more than 2%, while Bank of America lost around 3.5%.A bull market in stocks and the booming private credit market this year has calmed investors nerves about whether there is a systemic crisis emerging. The stock market Thursday appeared to be dragged lower by the decline in regional banks, leading the S&P 500 to finish lower.\"Today, I think, the risk to the bank space is idiosyncratic,\" said Timothy Coffey, associate director of depository research at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"The risk to the insured bank space for private credit could be more systemic, as well as the risk to credit quality from a weakening economy.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son, John Melloy and Scott Schnipper contributed to this report.",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. budget deficit edged lower for 2025 as record-setting tariff collections helped offset what also were unprecedented numbers for payments on the spiraling national debt, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.In a year marked by a bruising trade war and high financing costs, the federal government managed to escape with a $1.78 trillion shortfall, some $41 billion, or 2.2%, less than in fiscal 2024.While that's still on the high end historically, the red ink would have been still worse had it not been for a massive surge in customs duties and a September surplus of $198 billion that also set a record for the month.President Donald Trump's tariffs were a major contributor to tariff collections of $202 billion for the year, representing a 142% surge from 2024. September saw $30 billion in tariff payments, up 295% from the same period a year ago.Treasury officials estimated Thursday that the dip in the budget shortfall will bring the ratio of deficit to gross domestic product to 5.9%. The measure has not been below 6% since 2022 and generally runs around the 3% area except in times of economic stress.In an interview last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, noting Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit-to-GDP number would be below 6%, said \"we're on our way\" to reducing the debt and deficit burden.The impact from the deficit was felt in interest paid on the $38 trillion national debt.Interest on the debt totaled more than $1.2 trillion, also a record and nearly $100 billion higher than the 2024 outlay.Excluding interest that the Treasury earns on its investments, net interest payments totaled $970 billion, topping defense spending by $57 billion and behind only Social Security, Medicare and health care costs in the national budget.Trump slapped controversial tariffs on U.S. imports earlier this year despite protests that they would spike inflation and hurt consumers, resulting in lower demand and a hit to economic growth.While there have been signs of price increases in tariff-sensitive items, the moves have been mostly incremental. Federal Reserve officials say they likely will lower their benchmark interest rate further as they expect any price increases to be temporary. The current fed funds rate stands at 4.00% to 4.25%.The government's fiscal year ended in September, with the U.S. collecting $5.2 trillion in revenue over the prior 12 months while spending just over $7 trillion.",

    "body": "watch nowA Republican bill to end the government shutdown failed in the Senate for the 10th time on Thursday, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate as the lapse in federal funding stretched into its third week.  The resolution came up short in a 51-45 vote that fell mostly along party lines. Sixty senators are needed to approve any stopgap bill; Republicans hold a narrow 53-seat majority in the Senate.Earlier Thursday, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called on President Donald Trump to get involved in the negotiations between Republican and Democratic senators to break the impasse.\"I think we need the president to make that happen, that he needs to engage with Mike Johnson and John Thune,\" Kelly said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" referring to the Republicans who are the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, respectively.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything. That's the way this ends,\" the Arizona senator said.The sticking point in passing a funding deal is that Democrats insist that any such bill extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025.A Democratic bill to keep in place those extra subsidies, which about 22 million Americans use to reduce the cost of their Obamacare health plans, is expected to cost nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade.\"The president has talked about how he wants this fixed. He wants these subsidies to be dealt with,\" Kelly said.\"So he agrees we should open the government and we should fix the subsidy issue under the Affordable Care Act, and that's all we want,\" Kelly said. \"So I don't see what the issue is.\"Thune and other Republicans have said they would be willing to discuss whether to extend enhanced ACA tax credits after a short-term funding extension is approved.In an interview Thursday with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Thune said, \"We are happy to sit down and talk about a solution on the ACA, tax credits, but that needs to happen in a separate context, you know, away from having the government open.\"Johnson, in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, said, \"This is not a health care fight. This is a very simple funding fight. It always was.\"\"They have created a red herring. The subsidies don't expire until the end of the year,\" Johnson said.\"We were always planning to have the thoughtful debate and deliberation over that in the month of October and November, before the subsidies expired. They know that. They grabbed that issue from the end of the year and pulled it back into September to try to pretend like that was the issue. It never was,\" Johnson said.The speaker also said there \"needs a dramatic amount of reform\" with the ACA subsidies, \"if indeed they're going to be extended.\"Punchbowl News reported on Thursday that \"there's a bipartisan group of senators discussing several different potential off-ramps\" to the shutdown stalemate \"involving the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\"\"The group, led in part by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), is discussing the possibility of holding two side-by-side votes intended to end the shutdown,\" Punchbowl reported, cited people familiar with the matter.\"The first vote would be to reopen the government, while the second would be on a one-year extension of the Obamacare enhanced premium tax credits, plus a commitment to pass a longer-term solution by a date certain.\"",

    "body": "Meta Ray-Ban Gen 2 AI glasses during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica said a healthy amount of its revenue growth in the third quarter was due to its partnership with Meta, primarily from its Ray-Ban brand, to develop and sell smart glasses.\"Clearly there is a lift coming from Ray-Ban Meta wearables as a product category,\" CFO Stefano Grassi said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.The European eyewear company said sales in in the quarter grew 11.7% year-over-year to 6.9 billion euros (about $8 billion) from 6.44 billion euros a year earlier. Of that growth, more than 4 percentage points came from wearables, which includes the Meta products, the company said. In 2019, Meta and Luxottica inked a deal for Ray-Ban Meta branded smart glasses. Most recently, Luxottica's Oakley brand has joined the partnership, with the debut in June of the Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. The companies are also working on a version of the smart glasses to be released under the Prada brand, CNBC reported in June.Luxottica, which also oversees several popular brands like Vogue Eyewear and Persol, has been heavily pushing internet-connected glasses that work with Meta's AI-powered digital assistant. The technology allows users to play music, take photos and perform other actions similar to how they would use smartphones.\"We believe that glasses will be the future,\" Grassi said, adding that the wearables business is profitable. \"Glasses will materially replace most of the functionality that today we have embedded into our phones.\"Grassi's statement echoes sentiments expressed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said in July that \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"A couple weeks into the fourth quarter, Grassi said he has \"a good degree of optimism\" for the period, in part because of the rollout of \"all the new products that have been recently presented at the Meta Connect,\" which will \"all play a role in our fourth-quarter profile.\"At the Connect event in September, Zuckerberg revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which have a small digital display that can be manipulated with an accompanying wristband powered by neural technology. The company also unveiled new smart glasses, including the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses and the $379 Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses.Grassi said that Luxottica's sales growth in North America in the third quarter had more to do with the Ray-Ban Meta glasses than the effects of tariffs, which led to higher prices for its products.He said the company will be able to reach the 10 million unit capacity that it had originally planned to hit by the end of 2026 earlier than anticipated.\"The overall ecosystem of wearables is going to bring not only revenue associated with the hardware but also the revenue associated with lenses\" and over time from services tied to AI.EssilorLuxottica shares rose 2.4% on Thursday. Meta isn't the only tech giant getting into the burgeoning smart glasses market.Alphabet announced in May a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker to develop smart glasses powered by Google's Gemini AI digital assistant, while China's Alibaba unveiled its smart glasses in July that utilize its Quark AI assistant. Apple and OpenAI are also reportedly developing smart glasses.WATCH: Arm CEO Rene Haas on new partnership with Meta.watch now",

Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an e-mailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in the New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard. According to the Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Conway is founder and managing partner of SV Angel, an early-stage venture firm. He has long been an advocate for tech in San Francisco, having founded trade organization sf.citi and helping start FWD.us, which focused on immigration reform.The Salesforce Foundation isn't his only connection to Benioff's philanthropic efforts. Conway is also a large donor to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.Conway didn't respond to a request for comment.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Conway has supported Newsom, including in 2021, when he opposed a recall effort against the Democratic governor.WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sits down with Jim Cramer at Dreamforce 2025watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAs news of sour banks loans rattled Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the developments will pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates — a move that investors across the board have been hoping for.\"Today got real ugly, but at least we finally have something that can make the Federal Reserve itchy to cut interest rates sooner rather than later: bank loans gone bad,\" he said. \"Nothing motivates the Fed to move faster than credit losses, because they're a definitive sign that the economy is going south.\"The averages dipped during Thursday's session as fears about the health of regional banks' lending business grew. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite finished down 0.5%, lead by declines in bank stocks.Worries about lending practices — especially in the private credit market — ramped up recently after two auto industry related outfits, Tricolor and First Brands, filed for bankruptcy. Zions Bancorporation disclosed a $50 million loss on two commercial loans Wednesday evening, and then on Thursday, Western Alliance alleged that a borrower had committed fraud.These bad loans are early warning signs that it's time for the central bank to ease, Cramer said. He suggested the banking system has now \"provided us with enough questionable credits in one week's time\" that the Fed can quickly slash rates without worrying too much about inflation.While lower borrowing rates stimulate the economy generally, Cramer emphasized that they also make it easier for borrowers not to default.Cramer referenced comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon who earlier this month suggested the auto companies' bankruptcies were like cockroaches, saying \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Dimon's comments turned out to be prescient, Cramer indicated.But these credit issues may not hurt the broader market, Cramer suggested.\"Now, it's possible there's foul play involved in that multi-million problem of First Brands,\" he said. \"Doesn't matter, though: a bad loan is a bad loan is a bad loan, and that's good for the stock market because these bad loans won't hurt profits of anything other than the banks. The pain will be contained, I think.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmericans may feel somewhat removed from the Federal Reserve, but the central bank's moves have a ripple effect on many types of consumer products, most notably the credit cards in their wallet.Nearly half of American households have credit card debt and pay more than 20% in interest, on average, on their revolving balances — making credit cards one of the most expensive ways to borrow money.\"For millions of American households, credit card debt represents their highest-cost debt by a wide margin,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. Since most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. When the Fed cuts rates, the prime rate lowers, too, and the interest rate on that credit card debt is likely to follow within a billing cycle or two.And yet, credit card APRs aren't falling much at all.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhy some credit card APRs aren't coming down, even after a Fed rate cutGovernment shutdown delays student loan forgiveness lawsuit — what to knowHow expiring ACA health insurance subsidies could impact Roth conversionsMillions of student loan borrowers at risk of default as late payments climbHow much you can make in 2026 and still pay 0% capital gainsWhat laid off federal workers need to know about their student loansDespite government shutdown, Oct. 15 is still the tax extension deadlineBoomers still love their department stores.

Some roles could ‘radically transform'CNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedConsumers hoping for \"an automatic, proportional drop\" in their credit card interest rates \"may be disappointed,\" according to a new report by CardRatings.com.When the Fed cut rates in the second half of 2024, lowering its benchmark by a full point by December, the average credit card rate fell by only 0.23% over the same period, CardRatings found.The central bank lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter point again last month. Yet the average credit card rate in the CardRatings survey was 24.22% for the third quarter, down just 0.09% from the previous quarter.The correlation between the Fed funds rate and credit card rates is often \"weaker\" than expected, said Jennifer Doss, CardRatings.com's executive editor. Credit card rates are also \"heavily influenced by credit conditions and individual credit scores,\" she said.'A highly competitive market'\"If the Fed continues to lower interest rates, consumers will likely see some declines in credit card APRs, but that may take some time and could vary depending on the type of card and individual issuer,\" said Jeff Sigmund, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.\"Credit card interest rates are set in a highly competitive market,\" he said.Generally, card issuers have several ways to mitigate their exposure to borrowers who could fall behind on payments or default. For example, issuers may trim back the lower end of the APR range (what's charged to more creditworthy borrowers) but not the high end, said Rossman.For some retail credit cards, APRs are even rising, despite the Fed's moves, according to a Bankrate survey. Banks that issue store-branded credit cards have said maintaining higher APRs was necessary following a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule limiting what the industry can charge in late fees.But even after bank trade groups succeeded in killing the CFPB rule earlier this year, some credit card companies, including Synchrony and Bread Financial, said they would not roll back the hikes.Even if your credit card rate were to fall by a full quarter point, in lockstep with the Fed's latest cut, it might go from 20.12% to 19.87%, Rossman said, \"that's still very high-cost debt.\"At these rates, there isn't much in the way of relief for consumers. \"We're talking a difference of $1 a month for someone making minimum payments toward the average balance,\" Rossman said.Of course, only consumers who carry a balance from month to month feel the pain of high APRs. \"The real consumer benefit lies in making your personal credit card rate 0%, either by paying in full — if you can — or signing up for a 0% balance transfer card,\" Rossman said of cards offering 12, 15 or even 21 months with no interest on transferred balances.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

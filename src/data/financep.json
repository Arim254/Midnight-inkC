    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin tumbled toward $60,000 this week as investors reassessed its utility. And while there isn't one clear catalyst driving the bloodbath, one thing is clear: the crypto market is in crisis. \"There's nothing going on in the marketplace that should have necessitated this type of a crash,\" Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, told CNBC. \"And so I think that's made people, frankly, more fearful. ... You have to ask yourself, 'is it over for bitcoin?'\"Bitcoin fell as low as $60,062 on Thursday, bringing it to its lowest level since Oct. 11, 2024. That's more than 52% off from its record high of $126,000 hit in early October 2025.  The previous session marked one of bitcoin's bloodiest ever, with the token shedding more than 15% on the day. Its daily relative strength index fell to 18, putting the asset in extremely oversold territory. As of Thursday, other digital assets like ether and solana were also down 24%  and 26% for the week to date, respectively — a sign investors' confidence in the entire crypto market is faltering.Bitcoin bounces, but losses loom largeBitcoin was rebounding on Friday, with the token last trading at $69,631.97, up more than 9% on the day.But, its recent drawdown has prompted investors to reevaluate its utility, including its role as a digital currency or as a store of value. Simultaneously, institutional appetite for the flagship crypto appears to be waning as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds record outsized outflows, threatening to drive bitcoin deeper into the red. \"This time is markedly different from other bear markets, however, in that it's not in response to a structural blowup,\" Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at crypto market-making firm Wintermute, said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"It's a fundamentally macro-driven deleveraging tied to positioning, risk appetite and narratives rather than systemic failures within crypto itself.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin prices over the past yearOver the past few months, investors have grown increasingly skeptical of efforts to recast bitcoin as \"digital gold,\" or an alternative to traditional safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin is down 28% over the past 12 months, while gold is up 72% during the same period — a testament to the latter's utility as a hedge against macro risks. Conversely, bitcoin has often traded down alongside other risk-on assets such as equities amid periods of high macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, raising doubts about its utility as a safe haven. Nearly a week after Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff announcement on April 2, 2025, bitcoin had fallen about 10% to below $80,000, while the S&P 500 had declined roughly 4%. Separately, investors are also reassessing the extent to which financial institutions, treasury firms and governments are willing to adopt bitcoin — a major catalyst for the token in recent years. Large institutional outflows are mounting as investors brace for bitcoin to go lower, thinning liquidity for the token, according to a recent analyst note from Deutsche Bank.Those outflows are also noticeable among spot bitcoin ETFs in recent months, according to the investment firm. The funds have seen outflows of more than $3 billion in January, in addition to roughly $2 billion last December and about $7 billion last November.Additionally, a swath of Strategy copycats that emerged over the past year or so have slowed or paused their bitcoin purchases amid the digital asset's correction. Finally, traders have acknowledged that longtime efforts to market bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies have largely faded. While Steak 'n Shake and Compass Coffee have rolled out support for bitcoin payments in recent years, initiatives to make the asset a form of payment have largely died, particularly as interest in dollar-pegged stablecoins grows, according to Bitwise's Ryan Rasmussen. \"We're seeing Wall Street adopt stablecoins because it is a fundamental transformation of the way payments work, and bitcoin is just a different asset. It's not meant for that today,\" Rasmussen said, arguing that the token's purpose has evolved from that of a currency to a decentralized, nongovernable store of value. \"I've never paid for coffee or a sandwich with bitcoin, and I never will.\"And beyond those more immediate concerns, investors are also increasingly worried that bitcoin's underlying network could be hacked, driving the token to zero. \"It certainly is a risk that is seeing more attention from investors as they're getting more worried about [it], and I think you're seeing a little bit of that risk priced into bitcoin,\" Rasmussen said.He noted that Bitwise has allocated funds toward efforts to mitigate the threat from quantum computing.Nevertheless, traders' appetite for bitcoin has largely dwindled, denting its price. That's true even as long-time believers are still proudly betting on bitcoin, despite of the charts and the naysayers. \"I believe that the story is intact,\" said Scaramucci, adding that he bought bitcoin for his fund on Thursday. \"But, I don't have a crystal ball. … Who the hell knows?\"",

    "body": "Playing for his fifth NFL team in eight years, 28-year-old quarterback Sam Darnold is preparing to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a potential championship title in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday — a moment that's required a high degree of mental resilience to reach, he told The Athletic on Friday.Darnold's career started with high expectations as the No. 3 draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Instead, he lost more games than he won over his first three seasons, got traded and ultimately served as a backup quarterback for multiple teams over multiple years. He won a starting job with the Minnesota Vikings in 2024 after his primary competition for the role suffered a season-ending knee injury, and to many pundits' surprise, led the Vikings to a 14-3 record that season.His performance led to a three-year contract with Seattle worth $100.5 million in March. Now on the precipice of an NFL championship, Darnold says the resilient mindset he first learned from his parents helped him overcome his own mistakes and self-doubt to resurrect his career.\"My dad worked as a plumber, and my mom is a PE teacher, and it never mattered what kind of day they had. They were always consistent for me and my sister,\" Darnold told The Athletic. \"[It] didn't matter what had happened at work; my dad was always out there playing catch with me afterwards. So, you know, I feel like I just naturally kind of learned to be resilient.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsDarnold still relies on his family to help him maintain a balanced mental state today, he said. \"I would say my family is a huge part in just my ability to get over things when it's bad, and they do a good job of keeping me grounded when things are good,\" said Darnold.Resilience is a key ingredient of success, psychologists agree: It helps us move on from mistakes while maintaining enough confidence to keep taking calculated risks. Teaching kids how to recover from failure and learn important lessons they can apply later on should be the goal of every parent who wants to raise mentally tough and resilient children, psychotherapist Amy Morin wrote for CNBC Make It in March 2021.\"The most accomplished people reached their goals by failing along the way,\" Morin wrote. \"Kids who do well later in life focus their attention on what went wrong and how they could fix it. They have growth mindsets that help them turn failures into positive learning experiences.\"A three-sentence mantra for resilienceEarly in his career, Darnold dwelled too much on his mistakes, he told Fox Sports in an interview that aired on Jan. 30. He'd allow his on-field performance to disproportionately affect his mood and overall mental health, he said.Reflecting on his parents' longtime mindset helped inspire the mental shift that Darnold credits with helping turn his career around, he said. \"Sometimes, mistakes happen and you learn from it,\" he said. \"And you don't want to make the same mistakes again, but [if you have] a long career, those things are going to happen.\"Darnold also took inspiration from a quote from Jerry Rice, one of the greatest players in NFL history, he told The San Francisco Standard on Thursday.\"Jerry Rice said that he never had a perfect practice or a perfect game,\" said Darnold. \"That's the mindset I try to have. It's not always going to be perfect, [but] it's about how can you move on from mistakes to continue to better the team and better yourself.\"Now, rather than dwelling on mistakes — which are bound to happen, in some way — Darnold tries \"to flush bad plays, flush bad games\" from his memory and move on with his positive attitude intact, he told The Athletic.When things don't work out the way he'd planned, he turns to a mantra for resilience, he said: \"'That happens. It's football. We're not always going to be perfect.'\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "A young woman wearing headphones browses vintage vinyl records in a store.Mihailomilovanovic | E+ | Getty ImagesAccount manager Matt Richards, 23, deleted all his social media apps from his phone last year, and was surprised to find that his life changed for the better. Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison.\"I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world,\" Richards told CNBC Make It in an interview. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. Going chronically offline is the latest trend to grip young people, and ironically it's going viral on social media. There's been an surge in TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engaging with in-person and analog hobbies. When I discovered the trend, I decided to make a post on LinkedIn to see if there were any young people willing to speak to me about going offline. To my surprise, I received nearly 100 responses from Gen Z and millennials sharing stories about social media detoxes and digital burnout. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. A 2025 Deloitte consumer trends survey of more than 4,000 Brits found that nearly a quarter of all consumers had deleted a social media app in the previous 12 months, rising to nearly a third for Gen Zers. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined, with time spent on the platforms peaking in 2022, an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI found. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, with the decline being particularly pronounced amongst teens and 20-something-year-olds. Jason Dorsey, President of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said that the increased \"nastiness and divisiveness\" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. \"We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they sort of regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life,\" Dorsey said in a conversation with CNBC Make It. 'Pressure platform' Young people deleting their social media platforms cite the increasing pressures of being online as well as the damage to their mental health. Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social media reported that it was because it negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. \"I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere,\" Richards said, adding that he felt like he didn't have enough things or had accomplished enough in his career. We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them...this person doesn't need validation.Matt Richards 23-year-old account manager Similarly, 36-year-old millennial entrepreneur Lucy Stace told CNBC Make It that she's limiting her social media use because it's \"diminishing\" her mental health despite it being essential to her business. \"We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information,\" she said. \"We're actually diminishing our brain's capacity to be able to look inward and listen to ourselves, and we're value tagging all of these things that aren't actually important to us.\" Tech giants face \"tremendous pressure\" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, which is off-putting to younger generations, generational expert Dorsey explained. \"The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to  —  they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world  —  now they're getting advertised to even more and their feeds feel just commercial after commercial,\" Dorsey said. Offline is the new 'cool' As the tide shifts against social media, account manager Richards noted that those who have gone offline have become more interesting. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. \"I think we're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s,\" he added. Social media manager Julianna Salguero, 31, said that social media stopped being cool when politicians and brands started using the platform.\"The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it,\" she said. As the digital generation struggles to make friends and find partners, they're instead seeking out in-person events from speed dating to professional networking, citing high levels of loneliness and isolation as a key driver. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an \"extremely exhausting process\" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. \"There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings,\" Gerrard told CNBC Make It. \"It's so much more than a trend.\" However, GWI analyst Chris Beer said he's not convinced that the FT and GWI findings reflect a structural shift and is instead a \"legitimate post-pandemic correction,\" as people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. He said shift is \"largely due to structural time allocation,\" especially for younger users, rather than \"an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media,\" as social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education.Analog is back In a Substack post in September, social media manager Salguero expressed a yearning to have lived life in the '90s when dating apps and doom scrolling weren't a prerequisite of being a young adult. The article titled \"How to have an analog fall\" wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media from writing physical letters, going on lunch dates, or opting for physical media like newspapers. The post received 5,000 likes, and Salguero told CNBC that going analog is a \"quiet revolution\" against social media, streaming, and content overload. Lacy Stace and her boyfriend's record collection.\"When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them, so for me the going analog of it all isn't necessarily  throwing my phone into the ocean, it's more about 'how do I reset my relationship with it',\" she said. Indeed, more young people are increasingly turning towards physical media, such as purchasing vinyl and record players, as they seek a break from digital life. Others are investing in flip phones, a relic of the 2000s. Now, entrepreneur Stace and her boyfriend have started building a record collection and visit record stores when they can. Meanwhile, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, Richards said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a brick phone, too. ",

    "description": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. ",
    "body": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January. Democrats have also considered taking stakes in U.S. industries in the past. But the Trump administration's approach carries risks both for the companies involved and for the broader markets in which they operate. \"It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. \"Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?\" Many of the investments are in smaller critical mineral companies, like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials, but they also include big industrial and tech companies such as U.S. Steel and Intel. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. Historically, the U.S. has taken equity stakes in companies in the context of bailouts with the understanding that the investments were temporary and the government would exit its position when the company was financially viable again, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. President Barack Obama, for example, took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis and President Franklin Roosevelt took stakes in the banking sector during the Great Depression. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. \"I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed,\" Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said.  After the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Lutnick told CNBC that President Donald Trump wants the American taxpayer to benefit when the government gives money to corporations.But the administration's approach creates political, legal and business risks for the companies involved, Harrell and Lincicome said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.Political, legal riskThe Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. The Democrats have typically been the party of industrial policy and intervention in markets.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. The measure ultimately died in the Senate. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. And Biden considered launching a sovereign wealth fund. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. But the legal basis for the Trump administration's investments is a grey area, Harrell said. The administration seems to rely on the rationale that it can take stakes because the law doesn't explicitly forbid it and the companies have agreed to the deals, he said.  The lack of a clear legal basis makes the companies vulnerable to lawsuits from competitors, Harrell said. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said.\"If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in November, a bunch of the CEOs of these companies are going to be hauled up in front of committees to answer questions about how these deals are going,\" he said.Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face \"government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny\" and \"inquiries about conflicts of interest.\" It also warned the deal faces \"the risk of litigation\" and is vulnerable to \"changes in federal administration and related executive and legislative priorities.\"Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. Capital misallocation riskThe equity stakes also raise the question of whether the government can be trusted to make the right bets on companies and technologies that will succeed over the long term, Harrell said. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. \"That's just straight up capital misallocation,\" he said.Business decisions could also become politicized, he said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. In the case of U.S. Steel, the federal government has a governance stake, called a golden share, rather than an economic interest in the company. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois\"That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company,\" Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking \"taking an economic interest\" in its business \"not a governance interest.\" Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights.\"Maybe they don't have formal voting rights,\" Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. \"But they do have a phone and they can pick up the phone and call. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote.\"And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Corporate silenceTop executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. \"When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly conflicted\" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said.\"The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet,\" he said.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026.Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares closed on Friday up 17%.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

    "body": "watch nowLow oil prices give President Donald Trump more leverage over Iran, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday, speaking as the two adversaries teeter on the brink of another conflict. \"The world is very well supplied with oil right now, and I think it gives President Trump more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices,\" Wright told CNBC in an interview when asked about the risk of a supply disruption due to tensions with Iran. The oil market is closing monitoring tensions in the Middle East for any sign that crude supplies could be disrupted. U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $63.55 per barrel Friday. Prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, after losing 20% in 2025. Oil market analysts are generally expecting a surplus this year after OPEC+ increased output and as U.S. production remains strong. Trump has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with military action if it does not negotiate over its nuclear program. The president threatened Iran with strikes in January during a mass uprising against the regime, but ultimately refrained. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Muscat, Oman earlier on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\" Iran is an OPEC member and produces more than 3 million barrels per day. Wright expects production in Venezuela to grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day this year, after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro early in January. The U.S. has seized control of Venezuela's oil sales and President Trump is pressuring U.S. companies to rebuild its energy sector.\"It will be a substantial percent of global demand growth this year,\" Wright said of output growth in the South American nation. \"Venezuela is going to be another helpful stabilizer of energy markets.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's official Truth Social account on Friday morning deleted a video showing a racist image of former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama portrayed as apes, following widespread bipartisan calls for its removal.The depiction of the Obamas, posted late Thursday from Trump's official Truth Social account, was included in a video clip pushing a conspiracy theory about voting machines during the 2020 election. The post stayed up for about 12 hours.Trump late Friday during a gaggle with reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One said that he won't apologize for the post. \"I didn't make a mistake,\" he said.Trump told reporters that he didn't watch the whole video, just the beginning.\"I didn't see the whole thing,\" Trump said. \"I looked at the first part, and it was really about voter fraud in the machines, how ‌crooked ‌it is, how disgusting it is. Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they look at ​the whole thing. But I guess somebody didn't.\"When asked if he condemned the video, he replied, \"Of course I do.\"The White House initially defended Trump's post.A screenshot from a video President Donald Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Feb. 5, 2026.

A source familiar with the matter, however, later told CNBC that Trump \"had not seen that video before it was posted.\"\"As soon as he found out, he ordered it taken down,\" the source added.Leavitt's initial reply included a link to a longer video posted Oct. 24 from a pro-Trump meme account on X.In addition to showing the Obamas as apes, the full video shows other animals bearing the faces of prominent Democrats, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Rep.

Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who is considered at risk of losing his seat in the House of Representatives in November's election, also criticized Trump's post.\"The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered,\" Lawler said on X. The Obama Foundation did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The video that Trump reposted carried the watermark of an entity calling itself Patriot News Outlet.CNBC reached out to Patriot News Outlet via its email address, requesting comment on the new video, asking who created it and for what purpose, and reaction to the video being removed from Trump's Truth Social feed.In response, the group said, \"We fully unaware of anything that President Trump might have posted including any video claiming to be from Patriot News Outlet. I cannot comment or any your questions for this reason [sic].\"\"Do you have a link to the video or copy of the video you can share?\" the group said.Trump's opponents may seek to make the post an issue for the midterm election in November, though it's still nine months away.

Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union and discussed recent problems, with the union telling members that \"our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline, and its rivals, were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed its biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats last month for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American likewise is revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "Volkswagen is one of three automakers expected to advertise during the Super Bowl in 2026.Courtesy VWDETROIT — Automakers are largely sitting on the advertising sidelines during this year's Super Bowl amid uncertainty in the U.S. automotive industry involving sales, tariffs and regulations.Carmakers — historically major buyers of ads during the big game — have been inconsistent with advertising during the Super Bowl in recent years, with only a handful putting out spots each year.\"It's definitely been on the decline,\" said Sean Muller, CEO of ad data company iSpot. \"Autos are tightening their belts, and they're probably pulling back on their budgets, and certainly that's reflected. I think the Super Bowl is a good barometer for all of this.\"Automakers accounted for 40% of Super Bowl ad minutes in 2012, but dropped all the way to 7% by 2025, according to iSpot. Only three automakers are expected to air ads, totaling roughly two minutes, during this year's game. Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here. How automakers react in 2026 will be tellingTim Mahoney, a longtime automotive marketing executive, said it's a balancing act when it comes to Super Bowl advertising. He said a company has to have the right product, ad campaign, and, of course, capital to stand out and get a return on its investment.\"Super Bowl is just a massive platform, but it has gotten so expensive,\" Mahoney, who worked for GM, VW, Subaru and Porsche, told CNBC. \"There are sometimes interesting ways to navigate around it. ... Adjacencies can be smart.\"During Mahoney's tenure, Subaru became the presenting sponsor of Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl and GM's Chevrolet brand \"blacked out\" TV screens just ahead of the Super Bowl for an ad for its in-vehicle Wi-Fi in 2015.Outside of the Super Bowl, automakers have increased sports advertising and embraced more streaming and regional advertising over national reach, according to iSpot.\"They're not cutting back in live sports,\" Muller said, citing iSpot data that automakers now represent roughly 60% of spend on live sports.Autos outAutomotive executives who spoke to CNBC about not advertising during this year's Super Bowl said they were deterred due to the cost — $8 million on average for a 30-second ad — and felt their ad dollars would be better spent elsewhere.\"We are going to really spread our efforts, so money and creativity, over a year,\" said Stellantis Chief Marketing Officer Olivier Francois, who is well known for past Super Bowl ads. \"There's no need for a peak or something in February.\"Stellantis, which is in the midst of a company turnaround plan, will focus this year on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. as its major marketing push in addition to more business-oriented spending and a provocative social media campaign for Jeep featuring a singing fish it launched this week.Nissan Motor, which last advertised during the Super Bowl in 2022, is also experimenting this year with parallel advertising.The Japan-based automaker on Friday released a comedic, high-energy \"Big Game\" social media ad promoting a chips-and-dip holder for its Nissan Rogue SUV. The \"Nissan Dip Seat\" ad stars chef and \"The Bear\" actor Matty Matheson promoting the fictional product. It also promotes a sweepstakes to win one of the vehicles.\"One of the key things for us is that we wanted to kind of find a way that was more social in nature. It's been a part of what our overall strategy has been this year,\" Nissan U.S. CMO Allyson Witherspoon told CNBC.Witherspoon declined to discuss the cost of the spot, but confirmed it was less than it would have spent to air a traditional Super Bowl ad.Others, such as Honda Motor, will look to the Olympics as their major ad spending. Honda is sponsoring U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams for the Winter Games in Milan this year as well as at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\"Super Bowl is one moment in time. The Olympics has so many verticals you can dip into and tell these stories,\" said Ed Beadle, who leads marketing for American Honda Motor.The opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics took place on Friday in Milan. It also kicks off a month that Comcast's NBCUniversal — which will be airing the Olympics, Super Bowl and NBA All-Star weekend — has coined \"Legendary February.\" 2026 adsGM remains a wild card for this year's game, as the only automaker to not prerelease its ad. The Detroit automaker is using the Super Bowl to launch its Cadillac F1 team, including revealing the look of its first livery car to a national audience.The automaker last month showed a design prototype of the vehicle in Detroit, including at the city's auto show, but it has not released any information about the commercial.Toyota, the NFL's official automotive partner, is expected to air two 30-second ads focused on family connections. One called \"Superhero Belt\" shows a grandson and a grandfather switching roles over the years and telling each other to secure their seatbelts. The other has not been released.Volkswagen's ad resurrects the automaker's well-known 1990s campaign for a new generation of customers, as part of a marketing drive called \"The Great Invitation: Drivers Wanted.\"The new campaign, including a 30-second Super Bowl spot, features many of the automaker's vehicles being driven around to House of Pain's 1992 hit \"Jump Around.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.Disclosure: CNBC parent Versant is carrying NBC Sports-produced Olympic coverage on its networks, including USA Network and CNBC.",

    "body": "The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year.Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute.And the administration's portfolio could keep growing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin.  In the past, the U.S. has taken temporary stakes in companies in the context of bailouts, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. \"With these companies, it's a very different thesis,\" Harrell said. \"The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose.\" U.S. SteelPresident Trump secured a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer.  The golden share is a governance stake that gives the president veto power over key business decisions. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. MP MaterialsMP Materials is a critical minerals company headquartered in Las Vegas that operates the only commercial rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass in California. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion.The Defense Department struck a landmark deal with MP in July 2025 that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an agreement to buy a portion of future output. The Pentagon agreed to buy $400 million of preferred stock and is entitled to a warrant allowing it to purchase additional shares. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. IntelThe Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium AmericasLithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. It has a $1.5 billion market cap. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years.\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE.Trilogy MetalsTrilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials.President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. The investment makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. Trilogy is also headquartered in Vancouver and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. USA Rare EarthUSA Rare Earth is yet another critical minerals startup that is also not generating any revenue yet. It is developing a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma and plans to build a rare earth mine at a deposit called Round Top in Texas. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization.The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding.In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. The government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company, depending on whether the warrants are exercised. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest.\"WestinghouseWestinghouse is a private nuclear reactor developer. It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan ElementsVulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. It will receive a $620 million loan from the Pentagon, $550 million of incentives from the Commerce Department and raise $550 million in private capital.Under the deal, Commerce will receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan and the Pentagon gets warrants in the company. XLightXLight is a private company headquartered in Palo Alto, California that is developing free-electron lasers to manufacture semiconductors. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. In exchange, Commerce would receive a $150 million equity stake in xLight.L3HarrisL3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. It announced a proposed partnership with the U.S. government in December in which the Pentagon would invest $1 billion in its rocket motor business, whose motors are used in missile systems.Under the terms of the investment, L3Harris would launch an initial public offering of its missile business in the second half of 2026, at which point the Pentagon's $1 billion investment would convert into common equity of the spun off division.

    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Attendees during the Singapore Airshow in Singapore, on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. The show runs through Feb. 8. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, defense buyers at the Singapore Airshow say they are prioritizing sovereignty, from local production and co‑development to owning the software and intellectual property that run their systems. Industry leaders say that control over hardware, software and supply chains is now a central factor in procurement decisions.Executives at the show, which closes on Sunday, pointed to shifting alliances and tougher rhetoric from major powers as a catalyst for the trend. \"There is a notion that is coming around very explicitly ... the notion of sovereignty,\" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development at French aerospace and defense firm Thales, told CNBC.Sourisse added that this mindset has helped drive defense spending higher as countries conclude they must look after their own security.Chua Jin Kiat, executive vice president and head of international defense business at Singapore engineering and defense firm ST Engineering, echoed the sentiment, and said that over the last 12 months, U.S. President Donald Trump's combative stance toward allies has pushed countries to realize that \"we may not be able to depend on others.\"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has pushed its allies to spend more on defense, with NATO committing to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2035. Trump has threatened allies' such as Canada and most recently Denmark over its territory of Greenland. He has also reportedly said he would sell allies weaker versions of American weapons \"because someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"Chua added that countries are recognizing that old alliances and alignments may not be \"so enforceable or relevant\" anymore, even organizations such as NATO. \"So you can be a NATO member. But actually, at the end of the day today, what we are seeing is, first and foremost, if I'm Germany, I'm Germany. If I'm Finland, I'm Finland,\" he said. Supply chain resilienceA direct consequence of that shift is a renewed emphasis on boosting supply‑chain resilience. Companies told CNBC they are responding by localizing production, transferring know‑how, or partnering with domestic firms so customers can maintain and upgrade systems without long, fragile supply lines.Sourisse said Thales is not only marketing its solutions but also planning to localize activities and competencies. The company has set up joint labs in Singapore with local agencies to develop capabilities on the ground.ST Engineering's Chua said the company, constrained by Singapore's limited land area available for large factories, prefers co‑production arrangements overseas. For example, if ST Engineering can make advanced vehicles in a country with more space for production plants than Singapore, the company would collaborate and teach them how to build them in a co-production effort.\"For many of the big primes, they have to keep their factories at home running. They have got huge production plants, thousands of jobs, and the lights have to be kept on constantly.\"New kids on the blockSovereignty extends beyond factories to software and intellectual property. Newer firms in the defense tech space are becoming aware of those demands and are structuring deals accordingly.U.S.- based Shield AI, which develops autonomous warfare systems, signed a memorandum of understanding at the airshow to integrate its Hivemind autonomy software across selected ST Engineering platforms. Shield AI X-bat flight renderingShield AIThe company had earlier in 2025 partnered with the Republic of Singapore Air Force to use Hivemind to enhance the RSAF's autonomous capabilities.Brandon Tseng, co‑founder of Shield AI, told CNBC that Hivemind enables other companies and militaries to develop their own artificial-intelligence pilots locally, and Singapore would own that intellectual property. \"They can build AI pilots for whatever they want to do. We don't own [the IP],\" he told CNBC. Tseng added that while countries will continue to buy some foreign hardware, many want to indigenize critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy.",

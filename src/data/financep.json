    "body": "The logo of Japanese entertainment and electronics giant Sony is displayed at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on May 14, 2025.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesSony on Thursday reported a rise in operating profit that beat expectations, supported by favorable foreign exchange rates despite surging memory chip costs. Here are Sony's December quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: Revenue: 3.71 trillion Japanese yen ($23.68 billion) vs. 3.69 trillion yenOperating profit: 515 billion yen vs. 468.9 billion yenOperating profit jumped 22% from a year earlier, rebounding from a year-on-year decline in the previous quarter. Revenue was up a modest 1% over the same period.The Japanese technology and entertainment giant raised its full-year outlook and now expects operating profit of 1.54 trillion yen, an increase of 110 billion yen, or 8% from its previous forecast.Shares of Sony rose over 5% following the earnings release before reversing to fall 0.87% as of 1:21 p.m. local time.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSony also raised its annual revenue projection by 300 billion yen to 12.3 trillion yen, or 3%, while keeping its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs at 50 billion yen.Sales in the game and network services division, which houses its popular PlayStation home console brand and represents Sony's top revenue driver, totaled 1.613 trillion yen, down 68.7 billion yen from a year earlier.While the unit has benefited from a shift to digital game purchases and growth in the PlayStation Plus subscription service in recent quarters, hardware shipment growth has remained more subdued.Sony's hardware business is expected to face headwinds this year from rising component costs. PlayStation consoles rely on a type of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, which are in short supply as demand from artificial intelligence and data center operators increases.As a result, contract prices for conventional DRAM chips are projected to rise 90% to 95% in the current quarter from the previous three months, according to a report from market researcher TrendForce on Monday.Last month, a top semiconductor industry CEO told CNBC that the memory chip shortage was expected to persist through 2027.Offsetting some of the pressure on the gaming business were stronger results from its music and imaging segments.Revenue in Sony's music business rose 12.6% from a year earlier in the December quarter, supported by growth in live events, merchandising and streaming services. Meanwhile, its imaging and sensing solutions business grew by over 20% in revenue. The unit specializes in the development and manufacturing of semiconductor-based imaging and sensing technologies.",

Global benchmark Brent also fell 2.04% to $68.04 a barrel.Iran is seeking to focus talks on its longstanding nuclear dispute with Western powers, while the United States wants the agenda to also cover Tehran's ballistic missile program, its alleged backing of armed groups across the Middle East, and its domestic human rights record.On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"should be very worried,\" sending oil about 3% higher.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices slip after announcement of U.S.-Iran talksTrump had warned last month that he could order strikes on Iran if Tehran fails to agree to a deal around its nuclear program. He had also threatened to intervene in support of protesters who have been raising voices against the Islamic Republic.Analysts cautioned that markets may be over-interpreting diplomatic signals that could quickly reverse.\"It can be difficult to filter the messaging on Iran talks, which could lead to de-escalation but could also prove a mere tactical distraction ahead of military action,\" said MST Marquee's head of energy research, Saul Kavonic, who expects the oil market to \"jump around\" as sentiment around Iran talks develops and actual outcomes become clearer.He added that underlying risks remain elevated despite the pullback in prices. \"Ultimately, the large build up of military assets in the region by the U.S. and allies suggests a strike is more likely than not and the oil price is building in a premium to at least partly reflect that.\"Other analysts echoed the fragile nature of any diplomatic thaw and the asymmetric risks to oil supply should tensions flare again.\"Oil markets continue to react to the on again off again nature of potential talks between the United States and Iran, reflecting the deep distrust that each side has for the other,\" said Andy Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates.While Lipow said he does not expect Washington to directly target Iranian oil infrastructure, the risk of escalation could still come from Tehran. \"Iran might issue threats to tankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz in an attempt to halt loadings, and in the worst case attack those tankers in order to close the waterway, sending oil prices significantly higher.\"The Hormuz strait between Oman and Iran is a vital channel where about one fifth of global oil production flows daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It is a pivotal waterway linking crude producers in the Middle East with key markets across the world.Analysts at Citi warned that upside pressures remain embedded in the market.\"Crude oil prices moderated because of discussions concerning the upcoming US-Iran negotiations which have eased immediate risk premium, but both we and market participants remain concerned about upside risks,\" Citi said, pointing to U.S. actions toward Iran and uncertainty around Indian purchases of Russian oil as key factors.Citi noted that market positioning continues to reflect supply concerns, with oil for near-term delivery trading at a premium to later months, and skewed call option pricing showing that traders are still paying up for protection against higher prices.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's Hong Kong-listed technology stocks slid into bear market territory on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from last year's rally as tax worries and global risk aversion rattles investor confidence.The Hang Seng Tech Index, which is dominated by mainland Chinese tech firms, fell more than 1%, taking the index down a little over 20% from its October peak. The index is down for a sixth straight session.Market participants pointed to fears of a possible increase in value-added tax on internet services as a key trigger for the recent decline. The anxiety follows a VAT increase that has already been implemented on certain telecom services, raising worries that internet platforms could be next.Speculation briefly extended to online gaming and other digital transactions, amplifying fears of fresh policy headwinds for a sector already scarred by years of regulatory tightening. Following a decline in tech stocks, officials Tuesday dismissed the speculations of a levy on the gaming industry.\"The sell-off in recent days is driven by concerns over possible VAT tax increase on internet services, online gaming and other online transactions. This follows the recent VAT increase on certain telecom services,\" said Qi Wang, investment strategist at UOB Kay Hian.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPerformance of the Hang Seng Tech index in the past one yearThe pullback in China's tech stocks has also coincided with broader volatility in global technology markets, driven by fears around artificial intelligence-driven disruption to software companies.\"To me it's a barrage of negative news globally,\" said Phelix Lee, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.\"We have Anthropic reportedly rolling out an AI plugin that automates bits of legal work, sparking fears in legaltech firms and fueling the broader software sell down; then we have VAT hike rumors on Chinese internet firms and risk-off sentiment builds in the hardware AI trade as there are reports of rupture between Nvidia and OpenAI\"Despite the sharp drawdown, some investors see the sell-off as a corrective move rather than the start of a deeper downturn. Looking at the broader Hong Kong and China equity markets, the recent weakness appears concentrated in pockets that had previously outperformed, according to Morningstar. \"I regard the action as a healthy pullback and it's largely concentrated in sectors that have probably overshot fair values,\" said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at the firm.Other asset managers say the fundamental outlook for Chinese tech has not materially deteriorated, even as near-term positive triggers lack visibility. \"Catalysts have been somewhat lacking for the sector,\" said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privée. \"Recently, there's also been regulatory noise in travel and e-commerce, which we think are specific rather than systemic, as well as some worries about value-added tax,\" Ling said. \"Fundamentally nothing has changed to derail our positive outlook [for Chinese tech stocks]. Valuations continue to be supportive, sector earnings have potential to rebound, and AI may provide a stream of catalysts ahead.\" ",

    "body": "The replica of the ARM is an electronic chip board during a collaborative ceremony launching a partnership between Malaysia and ARM Holdings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 5, 2025. Hari Anggara | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of UK-based semiconductor designer Arm Holdings plunged 7.48% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company's licensing revenue missed Wall Street estimates.Arm's fiscal third-quarter licensing revenue rose 25% from a year earlier to $505 million, but came in 2.9% below the $519.9 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.Andrew Jackson, an equity analyst at Ortus Advisors, said that investors were also reacting to Arm's guidance only slightly beating estimates, as well as a poor outlook delivered by its chip design customer Qualcomm. Shares of Qualcomm also nosedived 9.68% after hours Wednesday. While the company's fiscal first-quarter results beat expectations, its forecast disappointed due to a global memory shortage.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDespite missing Wall Street estimates for licensing revenue, Arm posted record quarterly revenue of $1.242 billion for the last three months of 2025, driven by artificial intelligence demand. That figure beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.Arm's chip designs power most of the world's smartphones and are increasingly used in AI data centers and edge computing devices. \"ARM is trying to diversify into AI chips used for DC/servers, but the success of this remains uncertain, and its business model is still heavily reliant on royalties from chips used in consumer products such as handsets,\" Jackson said.He added that if Chinese smartphone production declines due to the memory shortages, Arm's outlook could worsen before improving.Executives at both Qualcomm and Arm have signaled that smartphone makers may scale back production volumes as supply constraints persist.Rolf Bulk, an analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC that such a scenario would also pressure Arm customers like Apple and Samsung.  Smartphones remain Arm's largest end market, accounting for roughly half of its revenues, even as exposure  to data centers increases, Bulk said. Shares of Arm, which went public in 2023, have also faced broader tech market pressures in the lead-up to earnings and are down 4% year-to-date. ",

    "body": "Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc. attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, July 9, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCSnap shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the Snapchat parent released fourth-quarter earnings that beat on sales. The company also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program.Here is how the company did compared with Wall Street's expectations:Earnings per share: 3 cents. That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates.Revenue: $1.72 billion vs. $1.70 billion expected, according to LSEG Global daily active users: 474 million vs. 478 million expected, according to StreetAccountGlobal average revenue per user (ARPU): $3.62 vs. $3.56 expected, according to StreetAccountThe social media company said first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.53 billion, which is below analyst estimates of $1.55 billion. Sales in Snap's fourth quarter rose 10% year over year, while net income was $45.2 million, which was up nearly 400% from the $9.1 million it reported a year ago.Snap said that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $358 million, topping the $300 million that StreetAccount was projecting.The company also said that its adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter will be between $170 million and $190 million. That midpoint is higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $178 million.Snap's fourth-quarter global DAU dropped by 3 million quarter-over-quarter, which the company attributed to a reduction in marketing spending \"in order to focus on more profitable growth,\" according to a letter to investors.Additionally, Snap said that due to Australia's social media minimum age act, the company \"implemented platform-level age verification\" in that country during the fourth quarter that resulted \"in the removal of approximately 400,000 accounts.\"The company said that DAU for the North American region was 94 million, lower than the 97 million that Wall Street was projecting.Snap shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading when an analyst asked the company's executives during an earnings call about potential regulatory challenges. \"Obviously, there's quite a bit working its way to the court system right now that would further restrict the use of Snapchat for our community,\" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said during the earnings call about the regulatory environment. Still, he said, the company's global ad sales stemming from users under the age of 18 is \"not material.\"\"Looking at the revenue-generating potential of the business looking forward, we're not overly concerned about the changing regulatory environment,\" Spiegel said.Snap CEO Evan Spiegel will be interviewed by CNBC's Julia Boorstin on Thursday at 11 AM ET.In the letter, Snap said it plans to focus on growing its subscription-related offerings, like Snapchat+ and the recently debuted Memories Storage Plans. The company said overall subscribers to those services grew 71% year over year to 24 million in the fourth quarter.\"Certainly memory storage plans were a big driver of the subscriber growth that we've seen recently,\" Spiegel said.Last week, Snap announced that it had created a wholly owned subsidiary named Specs Inc. that will develop and market the company's augmented reality glasses. \"We're super excited about what's ahead this year with the launch of Specs, and obviously graduating from the R&D phase of Specs to broader consumer adoption,\" Spiegel said about the company's upcoming AR glasses slated to debut in 2026.Because the company's AR glasses \"appeals to a different audience segment than the core Snapchat audience,\" Spiegel said, it's \"going to be really important for us to develop a standalone brand identity for Specs.\"Spiegel said that while \"there may be opportunities to raise additional capital\" for the company's AR glasses-related efforts in the future, Snap will need to be \"balancing\" the outside investment with its \"own ownership interest and any potential dilution.\"WATCH: Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on AR glasses.watch now",

Thom Tillis of North Carolina will end his blockade of Kevin Warsh, President Donald Trump's pick to replace Powell as Fed chair.Tillis on Wednesday in an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" doubled down on his vow that he will not vote to advance Warsh out of the Banking Committee until the Powell probe is dropped.Scott, in a Fox Business interview Wednesday morning, initially slammed Powell.\"I believe that it's time for a new [Fed] Chair, and thank God Almighty, we're getting ready to get one,\" he said.\"I have found him to be inept at doing his job,\" Scott said of Powell. \"But ineptness or being incompetent is not a criminal act.\"Scott noted that his questions to the Fed chair during a Banking Committee hearing last June are the same ones that are now under scrutiny by the Trump administration. \"I believe what he did was made a gross error in judgment. He was not prepared for that hearing,\" Scott said. But \"I do not believe that he committed a crime during the hearing,\" he said.The comments, while wrapped in criticism, serve as a defense of Powell, whom Trump has frequently railed against as he heaps pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates more quickly.The remarks are among Scott's first on the Powell criminal probe since the central bank chairman revealed its existence more than three weeks earlier.On Monday, Trump said the investigation into Powell, which is being led by U.S. Attorney for Washington Jeanine Pirro, should \"take it to the end and see.\"He also jabbed at Tillis, a member of the Banking Committee, who is retiring from Congress next January at the end of his current term. If Tillis sides with all 11 Democrats on the panel in opposing Warsh, he could prevent the Fed nominee from advancing to a full Senate vote.In the interview with CNBC, Tillis said he is prepared to continue his block \"for the remainder of this Congress, if that's what's necessary to get to the truth\" and keep the Fed independent from executive branch influence.Scott, a reliable ally of Trump's, praised Tillis on Fox Business as a productive member of his committee. \"I'm thankful that he continues to have real open dialogue on some of the issues he's concerned about,\" Scott said.\"I believe that we're going to resolve that issue. We're going to move forward, and Thom Tillis will be voting for Kevin Warsh as the next chairman of Federal Reserve. That's my prediction,\" Scott said. \"I believe we can solve the Jay Powell issue and move forward with a strong vote from all Republicans on the committee.\"In a video address after the investigation began, Powell said the DOJ served the Fed \"with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"Powell had testified in part about the multibillion-dollar renovations of the Fed's Washington headquarters. Trump has repeatedly accused Powell of either incompetence or corruption over his handling of the pricey construction project.But Powell said the threat of indictment \"is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings.\" Rather, he said, it stemmed from the Fed basing its rate-setting decisions on \"our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\"",

    "body": "TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping arrive for talks at the Gimhae Air Base, located next to the Gimhae International Airport in Busan on October 30, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he had a \"long and thorough call\" with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, naming Iran, Russia's war in Ukraine, China's energy purchases and his upcoming visit in April among the key talking points.  Beijing's statement, however, singled out Taiwan as \"the most important issue\" in bilateral relations, urging the U.S. to \"handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence.\" China maintains Taiwan is part of its territory, claims that have been rejected by the democratically governed island.Washington approved arms sales to Taiwan worth as much as $11.15 billion in December last year — one of its biggest ever — to strengthen the island's defenses and deter any military aggression by Beijing. China appears to be reminding Washington \"where the red lines are\" while seeking to avoid any action that could jeopardize Trump's plans to visit China in April, said David Meale, practice head for China at Eurasia Group.    Trump during his call stressed on the commercial ties between the two countries, including China's purchase of oil and gas, agricultural products and airline engine deliveries.   China agreed to increase its purchase of American soybeans to 20 million tones for the current season, 25 million for next, Trump said. \"The 'transaction-oriented' mindset of Trump should be a gift to Beijing as opposed to an ideology-driven one reinforced by coalition-building,\" said Neo Wang, lead China macro analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. The U.S. ambassador to China, David Purdue, reportedly said in a closed-door meeting in Hong Kong last month that Boeing was involved in the ongoing negotiations ahead of Trump's visit. Wang expects a signing ceremony for a deal covering as many as 500 Boeing aircraft to be witnessed by the two leaders during Trump's trip to Beijing. With a potential aircraft deal being the \"headline victory,\" Trump could remove the remaining 10% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports, \"during or shortly after\" the April meeting, Wang added. While Trump portrayed the call as an \"excellent\" discussion and touted his personal relationship with Xi was \"an extremely good one,\" Xi took a more measured tone, saying that \"the U.S. has its concerns and China has its concerns\" but a solution could be found if both sides approached each other with \"reciprocity.\"    Missing: rare earths, Venezuela Both sides did not mention China's supplies of rare earth minerals — an issue that flared up last year after Beijing used its dominance in critical minerals to gain leverage and push Trump to temper his tariff threats.    That could be a sign that the flow to the U.S. has been \"satisfactory,\" Wang said. Trump also sought to ramp up the U.S. stockpile of critical minerals through a new initiative, dubbed \"Project Vault,\" aimed at strengthening its supply chain to counter China's dominance in the sector.   The official readouts from both sides also left out the simmering tensions around Venezuela after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a stunning military operation earlier this year and seized the country's oil industry. Following the military operation, Trump had demanded that Venezuela cut its economic ties with several countries including China, but later softened his tone to say that Chinese investment would be welcome.   Iran flashpoint   Trump's call with Xi came hours after the Chinese president held a video conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin to discuss geopolitical flashpoints in the region. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Yshakov told reporters at a briefing following the Xi-Putin call that the two leaders sought to align their positions on global flashpoints including over Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. watch nowAccording to the official readouts, Xi and Putin appeared to be projecting a strong united front, with Moscow calling bilateral relations an important stabilizing factor at a time of growing global turmoil.Trump's call with Xi, where they discussed \"the current situation with Iran,\" came ahead of a critical talks between Washington and Tehran on Friday, although debates continued over the scope of the talk's agenda.    The Trump-Xi call suggested \"both sides have asks of each other for how they approach third country issues,\" said Meale, expecting the Middle East tensions to continue to be in play in the lead up to Trump's April visit. Trump had threatened strikes against Iran following Tehran's violent crackdown on protestors and earlier this week deployed a naval task force including aircraft carriers to the region. China is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. \"The broad swathe of topics covered in the call points to Trump's carrot and stick approach with China,\" said Reva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, as the American leader takes aim at Russia's oil exports and seeks Beijing's cooperation in bringing Putin to the negotiation table to ultimately broker a peace deal in Ukraine.

The stock rose in extended trading. Ciena is replacing human resources software company Dayforce, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement on Wednesday. Private equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired Dayforce for $12.3 billion.Ciena sells a variety of products for high-speed fiber optical networks. Nearly 18% of revenue in the 2025 fiscal year came from an unnamed cloud provider, and about 11% came from AT&T, according to the company's annual report. Ciena's market cap has almost tripled in the past year. Shares of companies added to the S&P 500 often rise ahead of their inclusion in the index, as fund managers buy shares to match the benchmark. Technology companies AppLovin, Datadog, DoorDash and Robinhood entered the S&P 500 in 2025.For Ciena, the entry marks a return. The company joined the index in 2001, boosted by the dot-com and telecom boom, and was removed in 2009, when it was replaced by Visa. Investor excitement has returned due to soaring demand for data center infrastructure that can run generative artificial intelligence models. The opportunity represents \"a major contributor to our 2026 expected growth rate,\" Ciena CEO Gary Smith told analysts on a conference call in December. At the time, the company called for revenue to grow about 24% during the 2026 fiscal year, which would mark the fastest rate of expansion since 2011.On Tuesday, Ciena's stock closed at the highest price since 2001. Network equipment giant Cisco recorded a new high on Tuesday as well.As companies look to deliver additional AI capacity, components such as memory have become harder to find, driving up prices. Optical parts are also constrained, Marc Graff, Ciena's finance chief, said on the December conference call.\"We've worked really closely with our key suppliers and I know who those are, to make sure that we can secure supply,\" Graff said.WATCH: Josh Brown's best stocks in the market: Morgan Stanley, Baker Hughes and Cienawatch now",

    "body": "All-electric vehicle maker Rivian is dealing with a lot: the end of federal support for EVs, a surge in hybrid vehicle sales and a rate of cash burn that still alarms investors, among other things.The company also has relatively low production and delivery numbers, but Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC in a December interview that's not the full story. \"The R1 is the best-selling premium electric SUV in the United States,\" he said, adding that it has been a top-selling premium SUV of any kind in the state of California. But the R1S carries a nearly $80,000 starting price. Rivian's hope is that the upcoming, less expensive R2 model can repeat that same success in the far larger midsize, mid-price SUV EV market.The R2 looks like a smaller R1S. Someone sitting inside will notice Rivian's familiar style and design language throughout the interior. It has Rivian's recognizable headlights. And it's much the same shape, with a long, flat roof that lets a 6-foot-1-inch person sit in the rear seat without slouching.  One of the biggest differences is that it has five seats, two fewer than the larger R1S. \"It's a smaller vehicle,\" Scaringe said. \"But I think this is the best vehicle we've developed to date. We're incredibly bullish on this and excited for it. Of course it's cheaper, but it doesn't mean it's not an aspirational product, something that you're really going to enjoy and love to be in.\"Test rideScaringe took CNBC on a test drive of the R2 near the company's office in Palo Alto, California. It feels low to the ground and agile. \"Watch this,\" Scaringe said as we were driving on the freeway. He kicked the accelerator and the R2 shot forward. EVs are known for fast acceleration, but this might stand out for its class. \"It's quicker than it needs to be,\" he said.We didn't drive off road, but Scaringe said the R2 is trail-worthy, though customers shouldn't expect the more than 1,000-horsepower, go-anywhere capability of the $120,000 R1 Quad. \"It's a Rivian, so it still has to be adventure ready,\" Scaringe said. \"It can go out and be on a trail. It's just not going to be doing extreme rock crawling in the way that an R1 can do.\"Rivian's approach to design and manufacturing has enabled the company to pack a lot into a lower-cost package. Traditional cars have more than 60 computing units in them. By designing the computing architecture differently, the company reduced that down to 17 in its first-generation R1 vehicles and then to seven in the second generation. That's the same number the R2 has, but the company was able to cut the length of the wiring in the vehicle by 2 miles from the previous generation. These kinds of design choices lower the cost of materials. \"It's a dramatic reduction in the cost structure to build it,\" Scaringe said. \"So it's key for both enabling the ramp-up in volume because it's so much more accessible in terms of pricing, but it's also much lower cost to build.\"There are also some unique features — rear-seat side windows drop down all the way into the door panel--highly unusual for the back of a vehicle — due to the location of the rear wheel. The company spent a lot of time getting the placement of the rear wheels right to allow it, Scaringe said.Lowering costs doesn't mean Rivian skimped everywhere. Customers had complained that there was no glove compartment on R1 vehicles, so the R2 has two of them. They both have a velvet-like lining that costs $11 per car. \"We wanted to make it a very nice environment,\" Scaringe said. \"So we spent the money to line them up. But this is a really good example. That's a trade-off we made. The top-line number, the starting price of $45,000, has to be achieved. And we have to do it profitably.\"Wall Street's viewAnalysts are divided on whether Rivian can pull this off and match or beat Tesla's success. Needham analyst Chris Pierce said the consensus opinion holds that Rivian will sell about 15,000 units of the R2 in 2026, but he thinks the company can top that. He added that Rivian ranks first in Consumer Reports' owner satisfaction survey.\"They have the highest rating of people that own the car that want to buy it, that would buy the car again, would recommend the car to a friend,\" Pierce said. \"If you have a car and you like that car and you tell people, 'That's a great car,' that's the best form of advertising. It just seems like, for whatever reason, because of EV uncertainty, Trump, etc., people really got bearish on how many cars of this car they could sell.\"Rivian burned through $3 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, according to the company's financial statements. As of January, the company had about $7 billion in cash. Pierce said he expects Rivian to burn $5 billion in 2026. But company struck a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen to use Rivian software in VW vehicles worldwide, and that arrangement should bring in another $2 billion in 2026, leaving the company with about $4 billion in 2027 if all goes well. For now, Rivian needs to ramp up its new vehicle, which is expected to roll out to reservation holders in June. \"If we can have the type of market share that we have on R1, where it's the market share leader with R2, I mean, we'd have a real challenge of making enough of them,\" Scaringe said. \"So this is the hope, is we can capture that spark that's connected with so many customers and at the flagship price point.\"Watch the video to learn why Rivian is betting on the R2 in its pursuit to profitability.

    "body": "President and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano Amon delivers a speech at the Web Summit at Parque das Nacoes in Lisbon, on November 12, 2024. Patricia De Melo Moreira | AFP | Getty ImagesQualcomm reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations, but the company's forecast came up short because of the global memory shortage. Shares of Qualcomm tumbled as much as 10% in extended trading. Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: $3.50 adjusted vs. $3.41 expectedRevenue: $12.25 billion vs. $12.21 billion expectedIn the current quarter, Qualcomm said it expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.65 on revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $11.11 billion in sales and earnings of $2.89 per share.Qualcomm executives said in an interview that the shortfall in guidance was directly related to the global memory shortage. Big orders for data center memory are taking production capacity for memory for smartphones and other devices.The company's smartphone customers, who buy their own memory and pair it with Qualcomm's processors and modems, are closely watching their purchases and inventories and adjusting them based on the availability of memory.Qualcomm finance chief Akash Palkhiwala said the guidance gap versus consensus estimates was due to the memory issue. watch now\"We're starting to see that memory is going to define the size of the mobile market,\" Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview. Amon added that handset demand remains high, and the smartphone market is going through an upgrade cycle, but he said Qualcomm anticipates issues with smartphone supply. He said that the company doesn't know if smartphone makers will raise prices, but Amon said he expects Qualcomm's customers to focus on higher-tier devices, which will be more capable of absorbing memory price increases than budget handsets. Amon said on an earnings call that Qualcomm was most competitive in premium-tier handsets. \"We see this as an industry issue affecting everything in consumer electronics,\" Amon said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconQualcomm one-day stock chart.During the quarter, Qualcomm reported $7.82 billion in handset sales, a 3% rise on an annual basis. Qualcomm's overall revenue grew 5% during the quarter. Qualcomm's smaller businesses grew more quickly during the quarter.  The company's Internet of Things group, which includes both chips for industrial uses as well as the chip that powers the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, increased 9% during the quarter to $1.69 billion in sales. And Qualcomm's growing automotive business, which provides chips for carmakers, including Toyota, rose 15% to $1.1 billion for the division. Qualcomm said that it expected data center sales from its new AI chips and other data center products to start appearing in fiscal 2027.\"Everything is on track,\" Amon said on an earnings call. Net income in the period came in at $3 billion, or $2.78 per share, versus $3.18 billion, or $2.83 per diluted share in the year-ago period. In addition to selling chips, Qualcomm also licenses its intellectual property for technologies such as 5G to other hardware companies. That's reported as QTL revenues, which are significantly more profitable than hardware sales. Qualcomm reported $1.59 billion in QTL revenue during the quarter. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Qualcomm's net income for Q1 fiscal 2025 was $3.18 billion.

Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin in the past day, per Coin MetricsBitcoin first broke below the $73,000 mark on Tuesday, hitting its lowest price in roughly 16 months and approaching its pre-election value. Analysts say $70,000 is a key level to watch as the digital asset's downturn deepens, according to a Citi note to clients dated Tuesday.  The token's value is bleeding as a result of several of geopolitical and economic challenges, among other headwinds. Chief among them is investors' recent rotation out of risk-on assets due to rising tensions between the U.S. and Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's Greenland gambit and a recently ended partial government shutdown that delayed the release of some critical economic data. Also at play are expectations of a U.S. monetary policy shift following Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed chair late last month as well as a slowdown in efforts to create more crypto-friendly regulatory and legislative guardrails in the U.S. Large institutional outflows driven by expectations of a deeper bitcoin correction has also thinned liquidity for the token, hurting its price, according to a recent analyst note from Deutsche Bank. Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen significant outflows since a series of liquidations of highly leveraged digital asset positions last October, the analysts noted. The funds have recorded outflows of more than $3 billion in January, roughly $2 billion last December, and about $7 billion last November.  Bitcoin's pullback hit several crypto stocks. Strategy, a bitcoin treasury firm, was also down 5% on the day, while digital asset mining names like Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings shed almost 11%.",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in San Francisco, Aug. 27, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe share of U.S. homeowners with high rates on their mortgages has jumped sharply in just the last few years. That's having a marked impact on the refinance market and a somewhat more muted impact on home sales. Rates have been front and center in the debate over how to improve home affordability — and for good reason. In 2022, after mortgage interest rates hit more than a dozen record lows, sparking a refinance bonanza, barely 10% of homeowners had 30-year fixed mortgages with rates above 5%. Just four years later, that share has jumped to over 30%, according to ICE Mortgage Technology. About 20% of borrowers have mortgages with a rate over 6%.Home sales have been less than robust over the last few years, with the National Association of Realtors reporting a historically low 4.06 million sales last year, basically unchanged from 2024. This, after hitting a 15-year high of 6.12 million home sales in 2022. More recent sales, combined with some cash-out refinancing, pushed the share of higher-interest-rate borrowers up.There has been a major focus by the Trump administration to lower mortgage rates as a way to boost home affordability. The president recently announced a plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more than $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. It is still a subject of debate as to how much lower that would push mortgage rates once the purchase is made, but just the announcement alone caused rates to drop a bit. Industry experts say the actual purchases could shave perhaps about an eighth of a percentage point off the current 30-year rate, putting it right around 6%. Last year at this time, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.  If the average on the 30-year fixed moved to 6%, 5.5 million current homeowners would be able to benefit from a refinance, according to ICE Mortgage Technology. Those homeowners could save at least 75 basis points on their rate, which makes the fees involved financially worthwhile, it said. If rates dropped to 5.88%, that number grows to 6.5 million homeowners. \"The most popular interest rate that's been used to buy a home over the last 3.5 years is between 6.875% and 6.99%, right? Nobody wanted to tell their neighbors they used a 7% interest rate to buy a home, so everybody bought down into this high 6% range,\" said Andy Walden, ICE Mortgage Technology's head of mortgage and housing market research. \"Coincidentally, those 15-basis-point-spread moves from this $200 billion in MBS purchase is moving rates from what would have been six and a quarter right now down to six and an eighth. And so it's providing meaningfully more refinance incentive than would otherwise be out there, and it's having an oversized impact on the market,\" he said.

As for home sales, the last four years were characterized by the so-called rate \"lock-in\" effect, meaning potential sellers didn't want to give up their historically low rates. They therefore put off moves that they might otherwise have wanted to make. Entering 2025, there were roughly 39 million homeowners with an interest rate below 5% and roughly 12 million with an interest rate below 3%, according to Walden.\"If you look at how those borrowers behaved last year, only about 6% of those folks gave up those low rates, either through a refinance to pull equity out of their home or through the sale of their home. Close to 95% of homeowners held on to those rates tight,\" he said.As for prospective homebuyers, a 15-basis-point drop on the 30-year fixed rate would save only about $35 a month on the mortgage payment for the average-priced home. Alternately, they could keep the rate and buy 1.5% more home. \"Certainly a move in the right direction, but not a massive movement for those homebuyers,\" said Walden. watch now",

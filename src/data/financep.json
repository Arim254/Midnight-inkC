But, the winter slate is poised to deliver a consistent spark of ticket sales, pushing the 2025 domestical haul above $9 billion and toward a post-pandemic high, according to the latest estimates.</p><p>\"The box office year-to-date domestically is running about 4% ahead of last year and, if we can expand on that lead, we could be looking at the biggest post-pandemic year for movies,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.</p><p>Heading into the fourth quarter, the domestic box office has tallied $6.5 billion in ticket sales this year, up from $6.3 billion a year prior, according to data from Comscore. The full-year record the box office is looking to surpass is $9.05 billion, which was tallied in 2023.</p><p>Analysts at Macquarie foresee <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"Tron: Ares\" as the first domino to fall, creating momentum throughout the rest of the year. Then comes <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA/\">Universal's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"Wicked: For Good\" and Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" both of which Macquarie expects to top $250 million in domestic ticket sales. The year is capped with \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"</p><p>\"Fall typically sees its ups and downs, but the trifecta formed by 'Wicked: For Good,' 'Zootopia 2,' and 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' during the holiday season cannot be overstated in its significance,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"Plenty of other films will contribute to the aggregate numbers as crucial counter-programmers and mid-range tentpoles.\"</p><p>These other releases include Universal's \"Black Phone 2,\" Disney and 20th Studio's \"Predator: Badlands,\" <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"The Running Man\" and Universal's \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2.\"</p><p>Eric Handler of Roth Capital Partners projects the fourth-quarter box office to reach $2.5 billion, which would be a 7% jump year over year. That would put full-year revenue at close to $9.1 billion, 5% higher than 2024. </p><p>Macquarie's expectations are even higher, with the financial group estimating $2.7 billion for the quarter and a $9.2 billion year.</p><p>\"And we expect the box office will grow further in 2026, driven by spillover from 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' and a slate of blockbusters and popular IP such as 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' 'The Mandalorian and Grogu,' 'Toy Story 5,' 'Minions 3,' 'Moana,' 'Spider-Man: Brand New Day,' 'Avengers: Doomsday,' and 'Dune: Part Three,'\" Macquarie's team wrote.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.</em></p></div></div>",

Here are five of the biggest takeaways:</p><h3>Sitting out AI</h3><p>Megacap tech stocks have skyrocketed since the introduction of <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&utm_campaign=GOOG_C_SEM_GBR_Core_CHT_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_091724&utm_term=chatgpt&utm_content=169187630042&utm_ad=713941893301&utm_match=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21714513245&gbraid=0AAAAA-IW-UXxJOvlrH5weOlPYvA7ekZM_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Y3HBhCxARIsAN7931WRYGacXttcAl74xMh8Xp6yvqGLD8SrPQ-cS5NQr_94Kj_6TscBZwwaAgZnEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> in late 2022, leading many on Wall Street to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/another-mark-moving-ai-chip-deal-reason-to-buy-or-is-this-just-more-money-going-in-a-circle.html\">question</a> if the AI trade is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Asked if  investors have chased the AI trade too far, Lynch said he had \"no idea.\"</p><p>Lynch said he doesn't understand technology enough to have an informed opinion on the market's optimism toward AI.</p><p>\"I'm the lowest tech guy ever,\" he said. \"I can't do anything with computers. I just have yellow pads.\"</p><p>Lynch declined to discuss his current portfolio or the stocks he likes at the moment, citing rules from Fidelity.</p><h3>Why you don't 'play the market'</h3><p>Lynch has long advocated that investors have a deep understanding of the companies they invest in. It's a core tenet of his book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Up-Wall-Street-Already/dp/0743200403\" target=\"_blank\">One Up on Wall Street</a>.\"</p><p>\"I have this expression: 'Know what you own,''' Lynch said. \"If you don't understand what you own, you're toast.\"</p><p>Lynch said people will spend hours researching flights to ensure they get the best price. But when it comes to investing, he said \"they'll put $10,000 in some crazy stock they heard on the bus.\"</p><p>He described the phrase \"play the market\" as \"awful\" and \"dangerous.\" Instead, Lynch said people should buy good companies and have an awareness of what they do.</p><p>Lynch said that the average variation in a typical New York Stock Exchange security in any given year is 100%, so investors need to know what to do when big moves happen.</p><h3>Entering after the first inning</h3><p>While the conventional wisdom is to buy stocks before they take off, Lynch cautioned against scorning all investment ideas just because a security has already rallied.</p><p>\"Sometimes, you don't have to be in the first inning,\" Lynch said.</p><p>As an example, Lynch pointed to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which he was told long ago had already seen rapid domestic growth. The hamburger chain went on to see strong growth when it expanded internationally.</p><p>\"People said 'McDonald's is done,'\" Lynch said. \"They just simply didn't think it through.\"</p><h3>Investment advantages today</h3><p>Today's investors have \"cushions\" that didn't exist before the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-depression\" target=\"_blank\">Great Depression</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/great-depression-and-world-war-ii-1929-1945/franklin-delano-roosevelt-and-the-new-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">New Deal</a>, according to Lynch.</p><p>Lynch named unemployment insurance, Social Security benefits and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission helping everyday people over time. He also highlighted the active role of the Federal Reserve in recent decades. </p><p>Investors today benefit from \"so many things that are better,\" Lynch said, noting more market and economic \"buffers\" than existed in the past.</p><p>Lynch said investors have frequently braced for an economic collapse on the order of the 1930s. But none of the market tests since then, even the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/global_economy/policyresponses.html\" target=\"_blank\">Global Financial Crisis</a> in 2008-2009, have had the same downward intensity.</p><p>\"We had many opportunities to have a 'big one,'\" Lynch said. \"We've had some probably bad presidents, some bad congresses, we've had bad economists, and we've made it through.\"</p><h3>Future of work</h3><p>Lynch reassured workers who wonder if they will lose their jobs to AI.</p><p>In the early 1980s,about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System#:~:text=The%20Bell%20System%20was%20a,employed%20over%20one%20million%20people.\" target=\"_blank\">one million people</a> worked for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/T/\">AT&T</a><span><span></span></span></span> alone at a time when the entire labor force <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/269959/employment-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">stood at about 100 million</a>. Even as the telecom sector has grown, Lynch said the leading companies today employ about 400,000 workers. </p><p>Today, the U.S. workforce itself has swelled <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">past 160 million jobs</a>. Americans can probably count on expansion in some sectors to help offset elimination tied to technological advances or automation in others.</p><p>Lynch's comments come as executives at companies ranging from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CSA-FF/\">Accenture</a><span><span></span></span></span> have warned that artificial intelligence will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/walmart-ceo-ai-is-literally-going-to-change-every-job.html\">drastically</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/accenture-plans-on-exiting-staff-who-cant-be-reskilled-on-ai.html\">reshape</a> their workforces.</p><p>\"It's a great country. We're creative,\" Lynch said. \"America creates, China duplicates, and Europe legislates.\"</p><p>(Follow <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/the-best-stocks-in-the-market/\"><em>Josh Brown's take on the best stocks in the market right now</em></a>, including his investment outlook and where he sees opportunities next.)</p><p>(<em>Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live.

The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period.</p><p>Major economies are racing to develop their artificial intelligence capabilities, with both the U.S. and China looking to dominate the sector. The WTO noted that the U.S. accounted for roughly one-fifth of global AI-related trade growth in the first half of 2025. The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth over the same time period.</p><p>\"Trade growth spanned the digital value chain, from raw silicon and specialty gases to devices powering cloud platforms and AI applications,\" the WTO said in its report, noting that \"Asia's export performance was strong in AI-related products, consistent with the worldwide surge in investment in this sector.\"</p><p>A key downside risk to the latest forecast is the spread of trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty to more economies and sectors, WTO economists noted. On the upside, they said sustained growth in trade for AI-related goods and services could provide a medium-term boost to global trade.</p><p>Global services exports growth is expected to slow from 6.8% in 2024 to 4.6% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026. Although not directly subject to tariffs, services trade can be affected indirectly though links to goods trade and output.</p></div><h2><a></a>Sharp slowdown</h2><p>Looking ahead, possible signs of weakness in trade and manufacturing output had already been observed in developed economies, including reduced business and consumer confidence and slower growth in employment and incomes, the WTO noted.</p><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108193248-17568339551756833952-41463997657-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756833955&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tariffs aren't going to go away because of legal challenge, says Atlantic's Fred Kempe\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Commenting on the organization's latest outlook, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said \"countries' measured response to tariff changes in general, the growth potential of AI, as well as increased trade among the rest of the world — particularly among emerging economies — helped ease trade setbacks in 2025.\"</p><p>\"Trade resilience in 2025 is thanks in no small part to the stability provided by the rules-based multilateral trading system.

Macron, unwilling to cede government leadership to either side, instead appointed loyalists to lead minority governments but these have proven vulnerable to no-confidence motions from rival parties.</p><p>Lecornu's short-lived government was the third to have failed after the ill-fated administrations of Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou. What they have in common is that they've all struggled to reach agreements with other parties over the state budget, and particularly over the spending cuts and tax rises seen as necessary to rein in France's budget deficit of 5.8% of its gross domestic product in 2024.</p><p>In a surprise twist on Monday evening, Macron gave Lecornu another 48 hours for \"final discussions\" with rival parties to try to break the impasse. Lecornu wrote on X that he will report to the president on Wednesday evening on any potential breakthrough \"so that he can draw all the necessary conclusions.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>What comes next?</h2><p>Macron now faces the unenviable task of deciding what to do next with no option likely to be attractive to the beleaguered president, who has repeatedly said he would not resign, a move that would trigger a new presidential election that's currently not due to take place until 2027.</p><div><p>France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a United Nations Summit on Palestinians at UN headquarters during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on September 22, 2025. </p><p>Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>He could choose another prime minister — France's sixth in less than two years — but choosing one not from his own political stable will be an uncomfortable and unedifying prospect for Macron, who has repeatedly picked loyalists to lead government in the last year.</p><p>Or he can dissolve parliament and hold new parliamentary elections. That option won't appeal either as Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally party is currently leading <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/\" target=\"_blank\">voter polls</a>, seen with around 32% of the vote compared to the 25% of the vote being held by left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front.</p><p>Macron is seen as unlikely to choose to resign, analysts say. \"It's too dangerous for him to do the right thing and he's unwilling, of course, to step down from power,\" Douglas Yates, professor of Political Science at INSEAD, told CNBC on Monday.</p><p>\"The one thing I can say with security today is that Macron is not going to announce his own resignation and so it would seem that the easiest thing to do would be to name another prime minister, which he does like I change shirts, and if the new PM doesn't last a long time, he could name another one. And that would be to play his institutional advantage.\"</p><p>Yates did not believe Macron would call fresh elections \"because the last time he did that it was so catastrophic\" and any new polls would again reflect the polarized nature of politics in France, with a chasm between far left and far right voters. \"People would abandon his party and vote with their hearts, either left or right,\" Yates added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Left, or right?</h2><div><p>There is speculation that Macron could take the plunge and nominate a PM who is not an ally from his own centrist political backyard, with a pick from the center-left Socialist Party a possibility.</p><p>There is little chance Macron would opt for a candidate from either the far-left France Unbowed party or far-right National Rally, with both parties on Monday calling for Macron's dismissal.</p></div><div><p>The President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen addresses the press upon her arrival at her party's headquarters in Paris, on October 6, 2025.  </p><p>Thomas Samson | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>\"So far he's chosen the wrong person, and by choosing people from the center, he's alienated the left and the right,\" Yates said.</p><p>\"I think he would do better by throwing some fresh meat to the center-left who could help him constitute a government and possibly avoid a motion of censure, so I think a Socialist would probably be the most acceptable, or even one of the Greens' candidates,\" Yates said.</p></div><h2><a></a>And, the budget?</h2><div><p>While political paralysis continues in Paris, the 2026 budget remains in limbo, and economists say it's increasingly likely that this year's budget is rolled into next year as a stop-gap measure.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Yacine Rouimi on Monday said that if the government collapsed, as it has now, then France would likely operate under a special law, \"maintaining spending near the 2025 framework, with the deficit landing around 5.0–5.4 % of GDP.\"</p><p>\"It's not impossible that we'll see fresh elections soon,\" Rouimi said.</p><p>If Macron does opt to choose a new prime minister from a different party, such as the Socialist Party, that could mean reforms or spending cuts that were tabled by previous administrations, and which failed, could be sliced and slimmed down further.</p><p>Macron \"may appoint a prime minister from the centre-left (or even the far right). However, this would likely open the door to some painful reversals of his previous pro-growth structural reforms (such as the increase in the pension age) and fiscal slippage,\" Salomon Fiedler, economisst at Berenberg Bank, noted in emailed comments on Monday.</p></div></div>",

Those boards use chips from companies including STMicroelectronics, Renesas Electronics, Microchip and NXP Semiconductors.

Carlyle also reported that consumer prices for energy declined 3.8% while services excluding shelter, a key Federal Reserve data point, rose 3.3%.</p><p>Carlyle said it derived its data from its \"expansive global portfolio\" that includes 277 companies, 694 real estate investments and 730,000 employees.</p><p>Though the firm saw weaker employment data, Goldman Sachs recently said its \"underlying job growth\" tracker indicated a gain of 80,000 positions in September. Goldman also reported that the labor market is loosening, meaning there are more workers than jobs, to levels not seen in 10 years.</p></div></div>",

But it is a portfolio, and ultimately the goal is to have the entire portfolio all working together to drive the revenue and the profit that we hope to deliver for all of our investors.\" </p><p>The comments come nearly a year into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html\">Hill's tenure as CEO</a>. Investors are looking for more clarity into how well his strategy to turn around the company is working as quarterly sales and profits have declined for much of the last year.</p></div><div><p>Elliott Hill, CEO of Nike, speaking with CNBC. </p><p>CNBC</p></div><div><p>The struggles have shown in Nike's stock, which has fallen about 12% in the last year. While Wall Street knows how Hill plans to fix the company, it is still unclear how long it will take.</p><p>Since Hill took over last October, he's worked to reverse many of the strategies implemented by his predecessor, former <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EBAY/\">eBay</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO John Donahoe, who tried to sell more shoes and apparel directly to shoppers. Instead of focusing on sales only through Nike's website and stores, Hill is moving back to wholesalers and working to win back shelf space that competitors have taken over. </p><p>During his interview with Eisen, Hill said Donahoe's focus on digital sales made sense during the Covid pandemic, but that changed when the world started to open up again. </p><p>\"When Covid hit, supply got constrained, demand goes up and I think the team did what I think anybody would do. Shift product over to digital commerce and all of a sudden that takes off. Double revenue, double margins and it's a winning strategy,\" said Hill.</p><p>\"Then of course everything normalized,\" he said. \"Physical retail started to open back up and we continued on with that strategy … and I think over time it ended up hurting the brand because there's a certain set of consumers that want to shop choice, and they want to shop across each of the different channels of distribution.\" </p><p>Hill said the company has made strides toward taking back the shelf space it lost. Nike is also trying fresh partners, such as Aritzia, to win over new, female shoppers. </p><p>Hill is also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">changing the way the business is segmented</a> and returning it to its historical roots. Instead of dividing the company into women's, men's and kid's, Donahoe's strategy to drive lifestyle sales, Hill is reworking the corporate structure so the company's departments are focused on individual sports. </p><p>\"They have small cross-functional teams in each of those segments, if you will, of business and the idea is that the consumers in each of those segments and the competition in each of those segments is different and so by having these small cross-functional teams … that's really helped us get sharp in a couple of areas,\" said Hill.</p><p>Under Donahoe, Nike faced criticism for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-blames-remote-work-for-innovation-slowdown.html\">falling behind on innovation</a> and losing market share because it was so focused on driving sales of classic styles, like the Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. Changing the company structure is one of the ways Hill plans to reignite innovation because the teams will be squarely focused on the individual needs of different athletes, allowing them to create and deliver better products for those consumers. </p><p>Many industry insiders expect Nike to make a complete recovery, but larger macroeconomic challenges will make a tough turnaround that much harder. </p><p>When reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings last week, Nike warned that it now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion in its current fiscal year, up from the $1 billion it projected in June. Those costs are expected to impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year, up from the 0.75 percentage point it originally forecast. </p><p>Hill told Eisen the company is working to offset the cost of tariffs by leaning on its suppliers, factories and retail partners. Nike also recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/nike-price-increases-tariffs.html\">implemented certain price increases</a>, which could help blunt the impact of the new duties. </p><p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Aritzia.</em></p></div></div>",

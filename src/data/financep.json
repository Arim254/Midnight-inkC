Shares closed at HK$6.51.While mainland China has imposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies since 2021, Hong Kong has been more receptive toward digital assets. Key cornerstone investors included Fidelity, UBS, Chinese investment firm CDH Investments and Cithara Fund amongst others. JPMorgan and financial services firm Guotai Haitong were among the joint bookrunners.\"Our mission is to make digital assets massively accessible, and what we are doing is to create a compliant platform to connect our users with the digital assets industry,\" HashKey Chief Financial Officer Eric Zhu told CNBC. \"We are confident that the [crypto] penetration rate in Hong Kong, in the Asian market, is going to catch up with what happens in the U.S,\" Zhu added.The listing comes amid recent volatility in global cryptocurrency markets after touching record highs. The world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has dropped around 36% in about a month after hitting an all-time high and crossing past $126,000 in early October. It is down about 6% so far this year. Established in 2018, HashKey operates a licensed digital asset platform offering exchange trading, over-the-counter services, on-chain services such as staking and tokenisation, as well as asset management solutions for institutional and retail clients.\"This is a milestone for the digital asset and wealth management industry in Asia. We believe Hong Kong is establishing itself as a key hub for regulated digital assets in Asia,\" said William Ma, CIO at GROW Investment Group.—CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Honda vehicles are lined up at a vehicle storage yard at an industrial port, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump struck a trade deal with Japan that lowers tariffs on auto imports, in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Japan, July 23, 2025. Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersJapan's exports in November rose at their fastest rate in nine months this year, growing at 6.1% year on year, data from the country's finance ministry released Wednesday showed.   The growth sharply beat expectations of an average 4.8% rise estimated by economists polled by Reuters, and was higher than the 3.6% seen in the previous month.  The export numbers were supported by a 23.6% increase in goods shipped to Western Europe, as well as an 8.8% rise in exports to the U.S., its second largest trading partner. This marks the first time that exports to the U.S. from Japan have increased since March.Exports of automobiles fell 4.1% by value, but auto shipments to the U.S. posted a recovery, rising 1.5% year in year in November. The data comes after revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that Japan's economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis. Shipments to mainland China fell 2.4%, but exports to Hong Kong jumped 11.4% compared to the same period the previous year. Exports of \"foodstuff\" to mainland China fell 5.9% by value. In November, tensions between Japan and China rose after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could trigger an intervention by Japan's military, leading to Beijing restricting imports of Japanese seafood. Imports into Japan rose 1.3% in November, compared to expectations of a 2.5% rise. Trade and diplomatic frictions aside, Japanese companies are positive on business growth, with the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing that sentiment among Japanese companies mostly improved in the fourth quarter, especially among small manufacturers.Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, highlighted the growth in semiconductor and equipment exports, saying that the U.S.-led boom in tech spending is translating into growing exports of specialized machinery and equipment.Exports of electrical machinery jumped 7.4%, and semiconductor-related exports surged 13% year on year, which Koll said is a \"confirmation of Japan's competitiveness in supplying machines that make machines.\"The market is underestimating the positive implications of the U.S. capex boom, much of what goes into the new data centers and AI hardware enablers and power centers is Made in Japan, and can only be made in Japan,\" Koll added.",

    "body": "The Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNasdaq is moving closer to around-the-clock stock trading, a shift that some on Wall Street are calling unnecessary — and potentially destabilizing.The exchange said it plans to submit paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow U.S.-listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week. If approved, the new schedule would launch in the second half of 2026.Under the proposal, Nasdaq would expand trading hours to 23 hours each weekday from the current 16 hours. Stocks would trade in a \"day session\" from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, followed by a one-hour pause for maintenance, testing and clearing. A \"night session\" would then run from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. the following morning.Critics argue that formalizing nearly nonstop trading could worsen some of the very problems that plague the structure of equity markets today — thin liquidity, sharp price swings and an increasingly \"gamified\" trading environment.'Worst thing in the world'\"This is literally the worst thing in the world,\" the Wells Fargo trading desk wrote in a note to clients. \"I cannot think of an action that single-handedly gamifies the stock market even more than it has already become. This is the epitome of making trading even more like gambling.\"Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and a former market maker on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, raised concerns about the impact on listed companies themselves.\"Listed companies need a time to break and release news events and to have meetings where they're not moving markets, and now we're taking that away from them,\" Woods said. \"You're opening up a new can of worms.\"Nasdaq currently operates three weekday sessions: pre-market trading from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., the regular session from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and after-hours trading from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.Retail-focused brokers, including Robinhood, have already rolled out extended or near-24-hour trading for certain U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies, responding to demand from individual investors who want the ability to trade on global news at any time.The New York Stock Exchange is pursuing its own extended-hours model, with plans for 22 hours of weekday trading that won initial SEC approval in February, contingent on data-feed upgrades.Liquidity clusterWells Fargo added that most liquidity already clusters around the market open and close, making the idea of stretching trading hours even further counterproductive. \"Most of the complaints that I hear on market structure are about how bad volumes are as most comes in around the open and close,\" the note said. \"And the industry move is to then elongate the trading day even further? This makes no sense at all.\"While Nasdaq says extended hours could eventually attract more participation, skeptics ask whether firms would be forced to staff trading desks around the clock.\"We know between 9:30 and 4, most traders are at their desk. The biggest institutions are working,\" Woods said. \"Are we going to have to add a whole new ecosphere of traders and institutions to man the desks so they can participate around the clock?\"Woods believes pauses in trading serve a purpose, enabling markets to digest information and participants to reset.\"We take breaks for a reason,\" Woods said. \"Let's recharge the batteries. Let's all get on the same page. We already have volatility ... during the day. If things move too far, too fast, we take a pause.\"",

    "body": "Shoppers walk past shops on Regent Street on the final weekday before Christmas in London on December 22, 2023.Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.K.'s inflation rate cooled sharply to 3.2% in November, boosting the chances of the Bank of England cutting interest rates at its final meeting of the year on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had expected inflation to stand at 3.5% in the twelve months to November — the lowest annual rate since March — and down from 3.6% in October. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, also rose by 3.2% in the year to November, down from 3.4% in October, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.Lower food prices, which traditionally rise in the run up to Christmas, were the main driver of the fall, with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals, ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner commented Wednesday.watch now\"Tobacco prices also helped pull the rate down, with prices easing slightly this month after a large rise a year ago. The fall in the price of women's clothing was another downward driver,\" Fitzner said in comments on X.While the rise in the cost of goods leaving factories slowed, the annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to rise, he added.Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the drop in the inflation rate but said there is \"more work to do.\"\"I know families across Britain who are worried about the cost of living will welcome this fall in inflation. But there is more to do,\" she said on X.Christmas rate cutThe data, coming after a print on Tuesday showing the U.K. unemployment rate rose 5.1%, is likely to encourage the Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% when it meets on Thursday. Economists expect a 5-4 vote by the central bank's MPC, however, with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey expected to be the swing vote in favor of a trim.Growth in the U.K. remains stubbornly low, with the economy eking out only a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter, according to the most recent data, and signs that unemployment could be ticking higher. \"These figures, alongside the recent deluge of downbeat data, mean that an interest rate cut tomorrow looks certain,\" Suren Thiru, economics director at the ICAEW, said after the inflation data. \"While the financial squeeze on households and businesses remains severe, these figures offer reassurance that the U.K. is moving towards a more modest inflation environment, helped by lower food prices,\" he noted in emailed comments.\"The growing downward pressure from a loosening labour market and wilting economy should help keep it on a downward path,\" he said.

    "body": "Candidates prepare to take the written test of public subjects for the 2025 exam for civil servants at Nanjing Forestry University in East China's Jiangsu Province, on December 8, 2024. Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA record number of educated young Chinese are flocking to government jobs for security as the world's second largest economy faces growing headwinds that have diminished prospects for private sector jobs.  As many as 3.7 million applicants nationwide, including graduates from the country's top universities, sat for the annual civil service exam last month. But only one in about 100 is expected to secure a place among the 38,100 entry-level government roles, starting next year. Many were willing to take those odds as private job prospects dim amid an economic slump and worsening business sentiment. Unemployment among 16- to 24-year-old urbanites in China has stayed above 17% since July, compared to around 10% in the U.S. Government jobs were once considered \"iron rice bowls\" for their stability and fixed hours. But as the Chinese economy opened up, the country's educated youth pursued higher pay and more job opportunities in the private sector, vying to join home-grown technology giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. Now these \"Iron rice bowls\" are making a come back again, as a prolonged economic slump and Beijing's regulatory crackdown on certain parts of the economy, such as real estate, technology and tutoring firms, have led to large-scale layoffs in the private sector. The top 500 private firms in China slashed their workforce by 314,600 last year, according to an industry and commerce association body. Amid the mismatch between available roles and expectations, jobseekers are lowering their ambitions, and searching for government jobs.Take 22-year-old Coral Yang. She spent four months job hunting before securing a role at a local marketing agency, only to have the offer rescinded weeks later after the company scrapped the position as part of cost cuts. \"There aren't many openings out there. It's crushing to lose an offer after months of searching,\" Yang said, \"but it just shows how unstable the private sector has become.\" Yang, who graduated from a top university in Shanghai majoring in data analytics, is now preparing to take the civil service exam next year.  She is not alone. A growing proportion of students listed public sector jobs, including government agencies and state-backed firms, as their top career choice last year, rising to about 63% in 2024 from 42% in 2020, according to a survey conducted by recruitment platform Zhilian Zhaopin.     Within public sector jobs, students face better employment odds at state-owned firms with more headcounts — compared with government agencies — making them a safer option given the low passing rates for government exams, said Wei Shan, a senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore. The number of graduates seeking jobs at private enterprises is declining, dropping to 12.5% last year from 25.1% in 2020, the survey showed. Rising uncertainty in the jobs market, layoffs and slowing wage growth in the private sector have pushed many youngsters to seek the \"security, predictable benefits and social prestige of public service,\" said Mingjiang Li, associate professor at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. China's education ministry has sought to bolster employment at privately owned enterprises, offering tax rebates, social insurance reliefs and subsidies to encourage hiring young graduates. But the incentives have been low. The Shanghai municipal government, for instance, offers just 1,500 yuan in one-time subsidy per new hire. Government hiring slowsApplications for public sector jobs surged, but openings are hardly keeping pace as local governments are struggling to expand headcounts, making civil service roles harder to come by. Fiscal strain from the property slump has left many local governments \"cash-constrained and reluctant to add staff,\" said Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noting that \"government hiring, after a period of expansion, has now flattened,\" making competition fiercer.  The new openings at government agencies jumped 66% in 2020 from a year earlier amid rising demand for public workers to enforce pandemic-induced lockdown and related efforts. But for 2026, the central government trimmed the headcount by 4% to 38,119. The competition ratio in some provinces now rivals the world's most selective universities ... quietly becoming one of China's most competitive national sporting events.Han Shen LinProfessor at New York University ShanghaiThus competition has become increasingly brutal: one in about 100 candidates will get hired next year, compared with one in 70 in 2023. The application-to-acceptance ratio for certain posts in rural area where jobs are already scarce was a staggering one in 6,470 applicants.“The competition ratio in some provinces now rivals the world's most selective universities ... quietly becoming one of China's most competitive national sporting events,\" said Han Shen Lin, a professor at New York University Shanghai.  A record number of college and vocational school graduates — some 12.7 million — are entering the job market next year, set to make the race even fiercer. As part of the push to absorb more employment, Beijing raised the eligibility age cap by three years to 38 for those with postgraduate degrees and 43 for those with PhD degrees, further increasing the candidate pool. But still, \"a significant share of the openings is being reserved for new graduates,\" said Shan, estimating that about 70% of new hires this year were graduates, up from less than 40% in 2019. Better work-life balanceThe surging demand for public service jobs is also the result of an increasingly disillusioned young population losing faith in private enterprises and attaching greater importance to work-life balance, experts say. \"More people are finding appeal in what they call 'lying flat' within the government system,\" said Shan, referring to the internet catchphrase where people drop out of the rat race and doing the bare minimum to get by. \"Of course, whether it's really like what people imagine is another question.\"  Many who successfully land government jobs find the rigid bureaucracy stifling, career advancement can be slow and gets more political the higher one climbs, said Neil Thomas, a fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \"This is hardly unique to China, but increasingly pronounced,\" he added.    Diminishing value of higher degreeMeanwhile, fewer students are betting on postgraduate studies. Candidates for the national postgraduate entrance exam that took place in October fell to 3.4 million, according to the education ministry, from a peak of 4.74 million in 2023, reflecting waning confidence in advanced degrees improving job prospects. \"The return on a graduate degree appears to be diminishing … the imbalance has led to a relative devaluation of the degree itself,\" said Xu, adding that many students no longer see an extra 2-3 years of study as a guaranteed path to better employment.  The Zhilian Zhaopin survey told a similar story. Vocational college graduates enjoyed stronger job prospects, with employment rates rising to 56.6% last year. Postgraduates, meanwhile, saw their chances deteriorate, with fewer than 45% landing offers, down from nearly 57% in 2023.Economists warn that an increasing share of top university graduates clustering in the public sector rather than pursuing entrepreneurial or high-risk private-sector paths could weigh on longer-term economic growth.  \"Over time, this trend could reshape China's talent landscape by strengthening the state bureaucracy's human-capital base while reducing innovation dynamism in the private economy,\" RSIS' Li noted.

    "body": "Pat Freiermuth #88 of the Pittsburgh Steelers runs the ball during the fourth quarter of the NFL 2025 game against the Miami Dolphins at Acrisure Stadium on Dec. 15, 2025 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Lauren Leigh Bacho | Getty ImagesRobinhood is stepping up the capabilities of its fastest growing product — prediction markets — by giving users the ability to place what are essential parlay bets on multiple NFL games, putting it into direct competition with traditional sports books.Starting Tuesday, users are able to trade preset combinations of the outcome, totals and spreads of individual NFL games, and starting in early 2026, users will have the ability to create custom combos of up to 10 outcomes across NFL games. Those will have \"a structural look or feel as a parlay,\" JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at Robinhood, told CNBC.Even more, the company is allowing users to wager on the performances of individual NFL players in real time. For example, they can place prop bets on a certain player scoring a touchdown at any point during a game as well as the passing, receiving and rushing yards for a player.\"This was a great opportunity for us to really be able to become the leader in the space, and that's what we're working to do,\" Mackenzie said. \"The enhancements here are another example of it, where we're trying to build new customer experiences that make it easier and, in some cases, provide them more advanced order types and trading capabilities to meet the needs that they're asking us for.\"The new features were unveiled at the company's \"Robinhood Presents: YES/NO\" keynote event at the Summit Skywalker Ranch in Nicasio, Calif., right outside San Francisco.The parlay capability may even extend beyond the NFL in the future, according to Robinhood. The broker is also looking at opportunities to allow combos across different event categories, including those outside of sports like economic data.Parlaying non-sports events\"Over time, the question is going to be, 'Is there interest to pair assets from different classes together?'\" Mackenzie said, noting \"something that's associated with climate and an election\" as an example. \"All sporting events are definitely on the radar. I also think that domestic and international economic data is going to be on there as well, as well as domestic and international policy.\"Robinhood's involvement with prediction markets began just before the 2024 presidential election, where it gave users the ability to trade a contract of former Vice President Kamala Harris or President Donald Trump.In a little more than a year since it partnered with ForecastEx for election trading, the company has only expanded its presence in the prediction markets ecosystem. It has partnered with prediction market operator Kalshi this year. More recently, it announced a joint venture with Susquehanna International Group in November.Robinhood has been seeing the fruits of its labor. Prediction markets as a business has already brought in $100 million in annualized revenue with 11 billion contracts traded by more than 1 million customers. Based on October figures, it's on pace to become a $300 million business.November was the business's biggest month to date at more than 3 billion contracts traded, signifying an approximately 20% increase from October. That month saw 2.5 billion contracts traded, which is more than the entirety of the year's third-quarter performance at 2.3 billion contracts. \"I actually think we're at the beginning of where this is really going to go,\" Mackenzie said. \"I think that we're going to continue to see the expansion of new not only events but also asset classes, where people can continue to trade in.\"Gen-Z's SchwabEarlier this year, Piper Sandler said that Robinhood's prediction markets business posed a \"significant\" growth opportunity for the company, and they're not the only ones that are optimistic. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said the strong desire among Robinhood users to interact with prediction markets presents \"lots of upside.\" In a recent survey, he found that users of Robinhood and Coinbase – another platform – are about nine times more likely than non-users to partake in prediction markets.\"They're going after a user base that's already predisposed to engaging with prediction markets,\" he said in an interview with CNBC. \"Over time, they're going to become sort of a hub for prediction markets.\"Dolev said Robinhood's move into prediction markets is a main reason the stock has soared a monstrous 220% in 2025.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHOOD, 1-dayHowever, the analyst underscored that prediction markets isn't the only thing to watch for the company. With its involvement in other areas like retirement, he forecasts that Robinhood will eventually become \"the new Schwab for Gen Z.\"To put that into perspective, Robinhood's assets under custody for the full 2024 year stood at $193 billion. Charles Schwab's total client assets were at $10.10 trillion in the same period.\"Prediction marks is one aspect,\" he continued. \"They're circling around every aspect of someone's financial life.\"KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Alex Markgraff concurs. He said that a number of the company's other endeavors, including its advisory business and its highly in-demand gold card, are in the \"early stages of scaling.\"\"In the short term, [prediction markets is] certainly an area where you might have sort of an outsized growth contribution just based on the apparent appetite for event contracts across the landscape of consumer retail trading,\" he said to CNBC. \"Nonetheless, [there are] multiple sources of growth, in our opinion.\"",

    "body": "Paul Putnam, 53, a rancher and independent contract pumper walks past a pump jack in Loving County, Texas, November 25, 2019.Angus Mordant | ReutersU.S. crude oil prices fell nearly 3% on Tuesday to close at the lowest level since early 2021, as a looming surplus and possible peace agreement in Ukraine weigh on the market.  West Texas Intermediate fell 2.73%, or $1.55, to close at $55.27 per barrel, the lowest since February 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Global benchmark Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92. U.S. crude has shed about 23% this year in its worst performance since 2018, while Brent is down about 21% for its worst year since 2020.U.S. gasoline prices have fallen below $3 per gallon to the lowest level in four years in a boost to consumers ahead of the holidays, according to the drivers' association AAA. Falling oil prices could signal a slowing economy. U.S. job growth totalled 64,000 in November but declined by 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6%.The oil market is under pressure this year as OPEC+ members have rapidly ramped up production after years of output cuts. Investors are also pricing in the possibility of lower geopolitical risk as President Donald Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a peace agreement with Russia. The threat of supply disruptions has loomed over the oil market since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has launched repeated drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure this year. The U.S. and its European allies, meanwhile, have targeted Russia's crude industry with sanctions. Ukraine's attacks on oil infrastructure and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies would likely be lifted relatively quickly in the event of an agreement, said Jorge Leon, Rystad Energy's head of geopolitical analysis, in a note to clients. \"This would significantly reduce the risk of near-term Russian supply disruptions and allow a sizeable volume of Russian oil currently stored on water to return to the market,\" Leon said. Russian oil stored on water is currently estimated at around 170 million barrels, according to Rystad.The end of U.S. sanctions on Russia would also change the incentives for OPEC+, Leon said. The group would likely resume a strategy to retake market share through higher production after recently pressing pause on that approach, he said. ",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stateside designated Venezuelan government a \"terrorist\" organization and ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said \"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"\"For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" Trump said.He added, \"It [the blockade] will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\"Venezuela labeled Trump's statement \"grotesque,\" saying his action \"violates International Law, free trade and free navigation, which constitutes a serious threat against a sovereign nation,\" calling the blockade \"absolutely irrational,\" according to a Google translation of Venezuelan media reports. According to the U.S. State Department, designating an entity as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to knowingly provide \"material support or resources\" to such an organization, among other measures. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNBC that a full embargo of Venezuelan oil would affect 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of oil per day, which could increase prices by about $2 to $3 per barrel. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThat would still leave the world \"well supplied\" as there's a global oil surplus of about 2 million barrels per day, Lipow said. However, Lipow also pointed out that \"The oil market will be watching the Chinese reaction as they are the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, benefiting from discounted prices and, they may be reluctant to observe USA sanctions, keeping Venezuelan oil flowing into the market.\"Brent crude rose 0.9% to $59.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 1% to $55.82 a barrel after after the news. Prices had hit a four-year low on Tuesday stateside, with WTI falling nearly 3% to $55.27 per barrel, while Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92.Lipow's view was also echoed by Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, who said that \"nothing substantively has changed,\" as long as only sanctioned tankers are targeted.\"We estimate that sanctioned (only) tankers would threaten about 0.3 million barrels of Venezuela's roughly 0.9 million barrels a day of total crude exports.\"McNally said that this alone is not enough to impart a sustained spike into crude prices, which are beginning to fall as surpluses emerge.The Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in recent months, saying that his \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico. Trump has categorically not ruled out a ground invasion of the South American nation.The White House has reportedly undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean, including deploying its largest aircraft carrier to the region, as well as launching strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S.— CNBC's Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Waymo co-CEOs (L-R): Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri DolgovWaymoSelf-driving car company Waymo is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding in the new year.The robotaxi company plans to raise billions from Alphabet, its parent company, as well as outside investors at a valuation as high as $110 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The latest funding discussions are indicative of Waymo's status as the leader of the pack in the U.S. robotaxi market. The company has been spending heavily to ramp up its fleet and continue expanding to more regions. Waymo is now either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles in 26 markets, in the U.S. and abroad.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo will \"meaningfully\" contribute to Alphabet's financials as soon as 2027, CNBC reported Tuesday.  If the Google sister company winds up raising as much as $15 billion, that would represent more than double the amount of its last funding round. That was a series C round of $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation, which closed in October 2024. Alphabet had committed $5 billion in a multiyear investment to Waymo at the time.That round was led by Alphabet alongside previous backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. At the time, Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said the funding would go toward expanding its robotaxi service.Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in the Austin, San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that Waymo crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company in December said it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.The company plans to open service next year in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Waymo also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark the company's first overseas service region.Amazon's Zoox this year began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December.Fundraising plans were first reported by The Information.WATCH: 2025: The year that the robotaxi went mainstream with Waymo leading the packwatch now",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersWhat started off as a particularly rough year for Tesla investors is turning into quite the celebration.Following a 36% plunge in the first quarter, the stock's worst period since 2022, Tesla shares have rallied all the way back, reaching an all-time closing high of $489.88, jumping 3.1% on Tuesday. They're now up 21% for the year. The prior intraday high was $488.54, reached almost exactly a year ago, and the previous record close was $479.86. The stock got a spark this week after CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest person, said Tesla has been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. With the rally, Tesla's market cap climbed to $1.63 trillion, making it the seventh-most valuable publicly traded company, behind Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, and slightly ahead of Broadcom. Musk's net worth now sits at about $684 billion, according to Forbes, more than $430 billion ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page, who is second on the list. Bullish investors view the news as a sign that the company will finally make good on its longtime promise to turn its existing electric vehicles into robotaxis with a software update. Tesla's automated driving systems being tested in Austin are not yet widely available, and a myriad of safety related questions remain.It's been a roller-coaster year for Tesla, which entered the year in a seemingly favorable position due to Musk's role in President Donald Trump's White House, running the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government and slash federal regulations. However, Musk's work with Trump, endorsements of far-right political figures around the world and incendiary political rhetoric sparked a consumer backlash that continues to weigh on Tesla's brand reputation and sales. For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 13% decrease in deliveries and a 20% plunge in automotive revenue. In the second quarter, the stock rallied but the sales decline continued, with auto revenue dropping 16%.The second half of the year has been much stronger. In October, Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue as buyers in the U.S. rushed to snap up EVs and take advantage of a federal tax credit that expired at the end of September. The stock jumped 40% in the period. Business challenges remain due to the loss of the tax credit, the ongoing backlash against Musk and strong competition from lower-cost or more appealing EVs made by companies including BYD and Xiaomi in China and Volkswagen in Europe.While Tesla released more affordable variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans in October, those haven't helped its U.S. or European sales so far. In the U.S., the new stripped-down options appear to be cannibalizing sales of Tesla's higher-priced models. According to Cox Automotive, Tesla's U.S. sales dropped in November to a four-year low.Despite a difficult environment for EV makers in the U.S., Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla this week to $530 from $475 and kept its buy recommendation on the stock. Analysts at the firm wrote that reported improvements in Tesla's FSD, or Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology, \"could support an accelerated expansion\" of its \"robotaxi fleet in Austin, San Francisco, and potentially earlier elimination of the chaperone.\" Tesla operates a Robotaxi-branded ride-hailing service in Texas and California, but the vehicles include drivers or human safety supervisors on board for now.WATCH: Why speed isn't selling EVs",

    "body": "A job seeker speaks with a recruiter at the KeySource booth at the Mega JobNewsUSA South Florida Job Fair held in the Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, on April 30, 2025.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesNonfarm payrolls grew slightly more than expected in November but slumped in October while unemployment hit its highest in four years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday in numbers delayed by the government shutdown.Job growth totaled a seasonally adjusted 64,000 for the month, better than the Dow Jones estimate of 45,000 and up from a sharp decline in October.The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, more than expected and its highest level since September 2021. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons swelled to 8.7%, its peak going back to August 2021.In addition to the November report, the BLS released an abbreviated October count that showed payrolls down 105,000. While there was no official estimate, Wall Street economists were largely expecting a decline following a surprise increase of 108,000 in September. The October slump came from a steep fall in government employment as deferred layoffs instituted earlier this year took effect. Government payrolls were off 162,000 for the month, and fell an additional 6,000 in November.The October decline marked the third time in six months that payrolls saw a net negative level. The BLS report also showed that August's numbers were revised down 22,000 to show a steeper loss of 26,000, while September's initial count was pushed lower by 11,000.The BLS had cautioned that the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, will be affected for several months by impacts of the shutdown. Challenges in capturing the October numbers led to the cancellation of both the jobs report and the closely watched consumer price index.Despite the complications, the report painted a familiar picture of the labor market. The jobs climate continues to be one of low hiring and low firing, affected as well by stringent border practices under President Donald Trump that have drained the workforce of the usual influx of immigrants. The establishment numbers showed most of the gains in November came from a familiar source — health care added 46,000 jobs, accounting for more than 70% of the total net increase. Construction rose by 28,000, while social assistance contributed 18,000.On the down side, transportation and warehousing was off 18,000, part of a continuing trend in job losses for the sector. Leisure and hospitality also posted a loss of 12,000. \"The U.S. economy is in a jobs recession,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The nation has added a mere 100,000 in the past six months. The bulk of those jobs were in healthcare, an industry that is almost always hiring due to America's aging population.\"However, the White House put a positive spin on the report.\"The strong jobs report shows how President Trump is fixing the damage caused by Joe Biden and creating a strong, America First economy in record time,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Workers' wages are rising, prices are falling, trillions of dollars in investments are pouring into our country, and the American economy is primed to boom in 2026.\"From a policy perspective, the Federal Reserve has had to work a difficult line between trying to head off further weakness in the labor market and guarding against making stubbornly high inflation worse.At its most recent meeting, the central bank lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point but signaled that the bar is higher for additional cuts. The Fed has approved three consecutive reductions since September, taking its benchmark funds rate down to a target range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"The Fed is unlikely to put much weight on today's report given data disruptions,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory.\"Markets continued to put low odds on another rate cut in January. The probability was around 24.4% following the jobs report, unchanged from Monday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Fed officials have maintained that the labor market is not a source of inflation, and Tuesday's jobs report backed up that assertion.Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, below the estimate for 0.3%, and were up 3.5% from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since May 2021.The 0.1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was largely a function of labor force growth.Over the two-month period, household employment actually increased by 407,000. However, that was offset partially by a rise of 323,000 in the labor force as the participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were flat in September, against a forecast for a 0.1% increase, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Excluding autos, however, sales increased 0.4%, better than the 0.2% estimate.",

A report <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/job-search/news-and-insights/market-report-q3-2025\" target=\"_blank\">published Wednesday</a> by Monster identified the top 10 job titles posted by employers on the jobs platform in the third quarter. The list indicates some of the hottest sectors right now are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/the-hiring-process-is-getting-faster-for-some-workersespecially-in-these-fields.html\">health care</a>, logistics, customer service and sales. Here's the list:</p><ol><li>Registered nurse</li><li>Physical therapist</li><li>Truck driver</li><li>Sales representative</li><li>Radiology technician/technologist</li><li>Speech language pathologist</li><li>Delivery driver</li><li>Respiratory therapist</li><li>Occupational therapist</li><li>Customer service representative</li></ol><p>Responsible for 6 of the 10 jobs on Monster's list, \"health care definitely drives this list, clinical roles especially,\" Vicki Salemi, career expert at Monster, tells CNBC Make It.</p><p>The report was based on tens of thousands of job listings during the third quarter.</p><p>In addition, \"essential roles continue to show resiliency,\" she says, referring to positions like truck and delivery drivers.</p><p>While some roles on the list require specialized training or professional certifications, others are more accessible to those who may not have industry experience yet.</p><p>For example, \"if someone works in an industry or any job really where you're interfacing with clients, then you most likely already possess those customer service skills,\" Salemi says.</p><p>If you're thinking of applying to a position you have limited experience in, you can also try to \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/hiring-managers-say-theyll-offer-more-money-to-candidates-with-these-skills.html\">upskill to gain those skills</a> and experience now,\" she adds.</p><p>Of course, other jobs that didn't make Monster's top 10 might still be growing. Seasonal hiring is getting underway soon, if not already, for many retail and hospitality positions around the year-end holidays.</p><p>Regardless of the role you're applying to, Salemi encourages job candidates to \"get granular\" and ditch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/1-in-5-laid-off-workers-submitted-over-100-applications-before-finding-a-job-new-report.html\">mass-apply methods</a> in favor of tailoring your application materials to each role, even if that means sending out fewer applications.</p><p>\"It's not about quantity; the key is not applying to hundreds of jobs and seeing what sticks,\" she says. \"Actually, it's the reverse. It's having a specific job search.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

But it is a portfolio, and ultimately the goal is to have the entire portfolio all working together to drive the revenue and the profit that we hope to deliver for all of our investors.\" </p><p>The comments come nearly a year into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/nike-ceo-john-donahoe-is-out-replaced-by-elliott-hill.html\">Hill's tenure as CEO</a>. Investors are looking for more clarity into how well his strategy to turn around the company is working as quarterly sales and profits have declined for much of the last year.</p></div><div><p>Elliott Hill, CEO of Nike, speaking with CNBC. </p><p>CNBC</p></div><div><p>The struggles have shown in Nike's stock, which has fallen about 12% in the last year. While Wall Street knows how Hill plans to fix the company, it is still unclear how long it will take.</p><p>Since Hill took over last October, he's worked to reverse many of the strategies implemented by his predecessor, former <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EBAY/\">eBay</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO John Donahoe, who tried to sell more shoes and apparel directly to shoppers. Instead of focusing on sales only through Nike's website and stores, Hill is moving back to wholesalers and working to win back shelf space that competitors have taken over. </p><p>During his interview with Eisen, Hill said Donahoe's focus on digital sales made sense during the Covid pandemic, but that changed when the world started to open up again. </p><p>\"When Covid hit, supply got constrained, demand goes up and I think the team did what I think anybody would do. Shift product over to digital commerce and all of a sudden that takes off. Double revenue, double margins and it's a winning strategy,\" said Hill.</p><p>\"Then of course everything normalized,\" he said. \"Physical retail started to open back up and we continued on with that strategy … and I think over time it ended up hurting the brand because there's a certain set of consumers that want to shop choice, and they want to shop across each of the different channels of distribution.\" </p><p>Hill said the company has made strides toward taking back the shelf space it lost. Nike is also trying fresh partners, such as Aritzia, to win over new, female shoppers. </p><p>Hill is also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/nike-to-lay-off-about-1percent-of-corporate-staff.html\">changing the way the business is segmented</a> and returning it to its historical roots. Instead of dividing the company into women's, men's and kid's, Donahoe's strategy to drive lifestyle sales, Hill is reworking the corporate structure so the company's departments are focused on individual sports. </p><p>\"They have small cross-functional teams in each of those segments, if you will, of business and the idea is that the consumers in each of those segments and the competition in each of those segments is different and so by having these small cross-functional teams … that's really helped us get sharp in a couple of areas,\" said Hill.</p><p>Under Donahoe, Nike faced criticism for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/nike-ceo-blames-remote-work-for-innovation-slowdown.html\">falling behind on innovation</a> and losing market share because it was so focused on driving sales of classic styles, like the Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. Changing the company structure is one of the ways Hill plans to reignite innovation because the teams will be squarely focused on the individual needs of different athletes, allowing them to create and deliver better products for those consumers. </p><p>Many industry insiders expect Nike to make a complete recovery, but larger macroeconomic challenges will make a tough turnaround that much harder. </p><p>When reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings last week, Nike warned that it now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion in its current fiscal year, up from the $1 billion it projected in June. Those costs are expected to impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year, up from the 0.75 percentage point it originally forecast. </p><p>Hill told Eisen the company is working to offset the cost of tariffs by leaning on its suppliers, factories and retail partners. Nike also recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/21/nike-price-increases-tariffs.html\">implemented certain price increases</a>, which could help blunt the impact of the new duties. </p><p><em>Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Aritzia.</em></p></div></div>",

The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period.</p><p>\"Trade growth spanned the digital value chain, from raw silicon and specialty gases to devices powering cloud platforms and AI applications,\" the WTO said in its report, noting that \"Asia's export performance was strong in AI-related products, consistent with the worldwide surge in investment in this sector.\"</p><p>A key downside risk to the latest forecast is the spread of trade-restrictive measures and policy uncertainty to more economies and sectors, WTO economists noted. On the upside, they said sustained growth in trade for AI-related goods and services could provide a medium-term boost to global trade.</p><p>Global services exports growth is expected to slow from 6.8% in 2024 to 4.6% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026. Although not directly subject to tariffs, services trade can be affected indirectly through links to goods trade and output.</p></div><h2><a></a>Sharp slowdown</h2><p>Looking ahead, possible signs of weakness in trade and manufacturing output had already been observed in developed economies, including reduced business and consumer confidence and slower growth in employment and incomes, the WTO noted.</p><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108193248-17568339551756833952-41463997657-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756833955&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tariffs aren't going to go away because of legal challenge, says Atlantic's Fred Kempe\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Commenting on the organization's latest outlook, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said, \"countries' measured response to tariff changes in general, the growth potential of AI, as well as increased trade among the rest of the world — particularly among emerging economies — helped ease trade setbacks in 2025.\"</p><p>\"Trade resilience in 2025 is thanks in no small part to the stability provided by the rules-based multilateral trading system.

Maybe you picture a new house or a luxurious lifestyle. But what you're really imagining is being satisfied with those things. You're not just picturing wealth, you're picturing contentment.</p><p>That's the feeling we're all chasing. But often, when reality doesn't live up to expectations, it's because the moment we get something new, we immediately start wanting whatever comes next.</p><p>While researching and writing my book, \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Spending-Money-Simple-Choices/dp/0593716620\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Spending Money: Simple Choices for a Happier Life</a>,\" I gained some fascinating insights into why chasing more often leads to less happiness.</p></div><h2><a></a>1. There's always beauty in the ordinary.</h2><div><p>The French writer Marcel Proust once told the story of a young man who was obsessed with the lives of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/06/get-rich-habits-self-made-millionaires-have-that-93-percent-of-americans-dont-money-expert.html\">rich and powerful</a>. Proust then told the young man to spend his time focusing on the artist Jean Siméon Chardin.</p><p>Chardin painted scenes of everyday life — food, animals, nature. The point was to appreciate objects that he already had in front of him. To learn to appreciate the life he had rather than to dwell on the dream life he didn't. \"When you walk around a kitchen, you will say to yourself, this is interesting, this is grand, this is beautiful like a Chardin,\" Proust wrote.</p><p>The lesson is to appreciate what's in front of you rather than dwelling on what you don't have. What a wonderful analogy for money, too.</p></div><h2><a></a>2. The happiest people aren't the wealthiest. They're the most content.</h2><div><p>The happiest people I know are the most content. Not necessarily the richest, the healthiest, the most beautiful, or the most successful. Just whoever gets to a point of saying, \"I'm satisfied with what I have and who I am.\"</p><p>Some of these people spend a lot of money and live incredibly materialistic lives. But I often think about my grandmother-in-law, who spent three decades in retirement with very little money, living off a meager Social Security check and nothing else. She was technically on the verge of poverty. But she was perfectly content in her small garden and reading books from the library.</p><p>She had little, but wanted even less. And she was one of the happiest people you could have ever met.</p></div><h2><a></a>3. The more you desire something you don't have, the more you're just focusing on the fact that you're not happy right now.</h2><div><p>For most people, there's a hierarchy of spending that goes something like this:</p><ul><li>If you don't want something and don't have it, you don't think about it.</li><li>If you want something and have it, you might feel OK.</li><li>If you want something and don't have it, you might feel motivated.</li><li>If you want something and can't have it, you drive yourself absolutely mad.</li></ul><p>The sooner you can look around and say, \"This is enough\" (regardless of your income or lifestyle), the sooner you'll realize you've been rich all along.</p></div><h2><a></a>4. Low expectations create psychological wealth.</h2><div><p>I've met half a dozen billionaires in my life — not a single one was as happy as my grandmother-in-law. It was easy to see why: Her low expectations gave her a sense of contentment, which in turn became an enormous source of psychological wealth that some of the richest people in the world lack.</p><p>Psychological wealth is such an important concept, and with money it comes from proper expectations. </p></div><h2><a></a>5. All happiness in life is just the gap between expectations and circumstances. </h2><div><p>The person who has everything but wants even more feels poorer than the person who has little but wants nothing else. How could it be any different?</p><p>That's not a plea to live like a monk. You can have a huge house, an expensive car, take incredible vacations — and be content with all of it, appreciating it and desiring nothing more. That can be an amazing life.</p><p>The key is realizing that happiness is the state when nothing is missing, regardless of the lifestyle you're living.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganhousel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Morgan Housel</strong></em></a><em> is the author of the new book, \"</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Art-Spending-Money-Simple-Choices/dp/0593716620\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Art of Spending Money: Simple Choices for a Richer Life</em></a><em>,\" and the New York Times bestsellers \"</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857197681/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=collfund-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0857197681&linkId=d46064f5f74177dac8d665e90383b12e\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Psychology of Money</em></a><em>\" and \"</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593332709?&linkCode=sl1&tag=collfund-20&linkId=c2372074e4235bc2443eebe800f9cbce&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Same As Ever</em></a><em>.\" He is a two-time winner of the Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers, and winner of the New York Times Sidney Award.

The clip ended with the numbers \"10/7,\" indicating Tuesday's date for the reveal.</p><p>Tesla posted a second <a href=\"https://x.com/Tesla/status/1975005586283434056\" target=\"_blank\">clip</a> to X on Sunday showing the outline of a vehicle's headlights in the dark.</p><p>Shares climbed 5% Monday as the buzz grew online over what the announcement would be, but dipped about 3% on Tuesday. Many investors were hoping for updates on other new products such as the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years.</p><p>The standard variant of the Model Y doesn't feature a panoramic glass roof, leather seats or the light bars like the higher-end versions of the SUV. It costs about $5,000 less than the previous, entry-level version of the Model Y.</p><p>The new Model Y standard features a battery that gets 321 miles of estimated range on a full charge, compared to the 357 miles of range in a Long Range version with rear wheel drive.</p><p>The lower prices may help Tesla attract some buyers after the loss of $7,500 federal EV tax credits, which went away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump's</a> spending bill. Tesla is still facing crushing competition across the globe, including in the U.S., from EV makers, some with lower-priced offerings.</p><p>Earlier this year, Tesla had reportedly been working on a stripped-down version of the Model Y and was aiming for a price closer to $30,000. That was before President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">DonaldTrump</a>'s sweeping tariff announcements and the elimination of the tax credit.</p></div><div><h2>Read more CNBC tech news</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/rivian-factory-ev-electric-truck-suv-headlights.html\">Inside Rivian's design factory and the story behind those distinct headlights</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/applovin-stock-tanks-on-report-sec-is-investigating-company-over-data-collection-practices.html\">AppLovin stock tanks on report SEC is investigating company over data-collection practices</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/openai-amd-chip-deal-ai.html\">OpenAI looks to take 10% stake in AMD through AI chip deal worth billions</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/cerebras-ceo-says-company-still-intends-to-go-public.html\">Cerebras CEO explains IPO withdrawal, says AI chipmaker still intends to go public</a></li></ul></div></div><div><p>The company hasn't released a new model vehicle for sale since it began shipping the Cybertruck, its angular unpainted steel pickup, in late 2023.</p><p>Musk originally promoted the Cybertruck at an \"unveiling\" event in 2019, where his demo went awry and he shattered a window. The Cybertuck never achieved the level of popularity of Tesla's Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUVs and has been the subject of at least eight voluntary recalls in the U.S.</p><p>With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car busine<em>s</em>s.</p><p>The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. But it's also due to an aging lineup and increased competition from companies including Volkswagen and BYD.</p><p>In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, \"We, Robot\" event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000.</p><p>As of the company's second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production.</p><p>At an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/tesla-semi-and-roadster-impressed-but-questions-linger.html\">event in late 2017</a>, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to \"fly,\" and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor.</p><p>Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade.</p><p>The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Alphabet's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Waymo and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIDU/\">Baidu's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Apollo Go.</p><p>In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla's Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they've yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots.</p><p>Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. It's now up 12% for the year. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/06/tesla-teases-new-product-launch-in-social-media-post.html\">Tesla teases new product launch</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208275-17597686351759768633-41974447527-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759768634&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tesla teases new product launch in social media post\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

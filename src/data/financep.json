    "body": "Algi Febri Sugita | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix said on Tuesday it had reached 325 million global paid subscribers, a new milestone for the streaming giant that last reported membership numbers a year ago. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. Here's how Netflix performed for the period ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 55 cents, estimatedRevenue: $12.05 billion vs $11.97 billion, estimatedNet income for the fourth quarter was $2.42 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.87 billion, or 43 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. Netflix said revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased advertising revenue. In recent years Netflix has been focused on growing its ad-supported membership tier. Netflix launched its ad-supported option in late 2022. On Tuesday, it said 2025 ad revenue grew by more than 2.5-times from 2024 to over $1.5 billion.The company said it expects 2026 overall revenue to range between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, due to increases in membership and pricing, as well as \"a projected rough doubling of ad revenue in 2026\" compared to the prior year. On Tuesday's earnings call with investors, Netflix leaders noted what they described as heated competition among industry peers when it comes to gaining subscribers and growing profitability. \"Looking ahead to '26 we're focused on improving the core business, you know, and we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films,\" said co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Still, Netflix's stock was down more than 4% in after-market trading on Tuesday. Netflix's report drew comparisons to a Wall Street Journal report from April that outlined ambitious internal financial targets at the streamer. By those lofty standards, Netflix's growth underwhelmed. But co-CEO Greg Peters said Tuesday the internal targets were considered \"long-term aspirations\" and not to be confused with a forecast. \"Having said that, those goals were based on organic process,\" Peters added, noting they didn't take into account the impact of mergers and acquisitions. WBD deal updateNetflix's quarterly report comes against the backdrop of its proposed transaction of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets. The company announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire streamer HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.Earlier on Tuesday Netflix amended its offer to be all-cash. The company said Tuesday it would pause share repurchases to fund the acquisition. Netflix said in its letter to shareholders that it believes the transaction will \"allow us to accelerate our business strategy.\" Netflix said Warner Bros.' library, development and intellectual property will allow it to boost its content selection for members and that HBO Max will help to \"offer more personalized and flexible subscription options.\" However, the proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock has dropped nearly 30%.And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. Lawmakers and industry insiders have also raised questions about whether the Netflix deal could win necessary regulatory approval. \"We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant,\" Sarandos said on Tuesday's call. \"And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth.\"Netflix has started the regulatory process, Sarandos said, adding he is confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer, ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\" The company has repeatedly argued the combination would preserve jobs during a time of heavy layoffs across media. On Tuesday, Sarandos said the Warner Bros. assets would bring the addition of businesses that don't already exist for Netflix. \"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"Sarandos and Peters both discussed the high level of competition in the media industry, which they said spans various platforms — from traditional TV to social media platforms like YouTube. Proving that Netflix is a small part of an expansive competitive landscape is likely to be key to Netflix's argument to antitrust regulators, CNBC previously reported. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Responding to Trump's comments, a U.K. government spokesman said Tuesday that \"the U.K. will never compromise on our national security.\"\"We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future,\" he added, according to comments published by BBC News.Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

    "body": "The Tether (USDT) stablecoin logo.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAmid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. \"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,\" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  \"Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.\"Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. Not so stable? Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using \"virtually worthless\" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an \"escape valve\" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  \"This was a violent repricing driven by fear,\" Li said. \"As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.\"He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, \"they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,\" in an emergency situation, Li said. \"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,\" he added.The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.\"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,\" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of \"put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,\" Campbell said.And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. \"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,\" Campbell said.

(Photo by Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia said it plans to double bilateral trade with the UAE to $200 billion by 2032, in a step toward diversifying its partnerships as a deal with the Asian country's biggest trading partner, the U.S., remains elusive.In a whirlwind, three-hour long meeting late Monday between UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, both countries' state-owned companies signed a 10-year liquefied natural gas supply agreement. Under the deal, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will supply LNG worth up to $3 billion for a period of 10 years, starting 2028, to India's state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. With this deal, India is now UAE's largest customer of LNG and will account for 20% of sales by 2029, ADNOC said in a release.Both countries also discussed \"a wide range of issues aimed at further strengthening the multifaceted India-UAE friendship,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a post on X.\"It was a productive visit in terms of outcome,\" said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation told CNBC's Inside India.He added that India-UAE ties have evolved to a point where \"regular high-level interaction at relatively short notice is going to become more common\".Trade between India and UAE touched $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. Both countries signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2022.India is the Middle Eastern country's second-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of its total trade and 14% of non-oil exports as of September 2025, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, an initiative backed by the commerce ministry. UAE was India's third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China in fiscal year 2025, and is home to 3.5 million Indian expatriates.Diversifying alliesIndia's plan to expand its trade with UAE comes at a time when the country's exports to the U.S. are under pressure owing to the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Indian goods since August last year.\"Even with a trade deal [with the U.S.] there is no guarantee that President Trump's \"unpredictability would end,\" said Pant, adding that it is the reason that India has been reaching out to finalise trade deal with other countries.Last year, following the U.S. tariffs, India entered trade pacts with the UK and Oman, and said it will sign a deal with New Zealand in the first half of 2026.",

The legality of that strategy will be decided by the Supreme Court, with a ruling expected as early as this week.\"Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs,\" said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith.\"Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal,\" Lowell said.Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. The court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case.If the court overturns the tariffs, \"it may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce,\" Lowell said. But \"that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling.\"watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said new tariffs will go into effect immediately.One of the other strategies the administration may turn to is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. Greenland is a mineral-rich island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.In a Jan. 14 proclamation, Trump invoked Section 232 authority to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to \"ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.\"If negotiations do not work, the proclamation says, \"it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner.\"While recent Section 232 actions from Trump included the immediate imposition of tariffs on products, in the latest Section 232 policy on critical minerals the language says that the executive branch of the government reserves the right of the president to impose tariffs.\"Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. ",

    "body": "Protesters with Danish and Greenlandic flags attend a demonstration in Copenhagen, Denmark, Jan. 17, 2026.Nichlas Pollier | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish pension operator AkademikerPension said it is exiting U.S. Treasurys because of finance concerns as Denmark spars with President Donald Trump over his threats to take over Greenland.Anders Schelde, AkademikerPension's investing chief, said the decision was driven by what it sees as \"poor [U.S.] government finances\" amid America's debt crisis. But it also comes as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Denmark after Trump's latest threats to tariff European countries if Greenland, an arctic territory of Denmark, isn't sold to the U.S.\"It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [U.S.] and Europe, but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision,\" Schelde said in a statement to CNBC.The fund currently has a position of around $100 million in U.S. Treasurys, an AkademikerPension spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The academics-focused fund plans to have exited that holding by the end of the month.Schelde chiefly cited the ballooning debt bill facing the U.S. after decades of government overspending. The U.S. recorded a budget shortfall of $1.78 trillion last year, down just over 2% from 2024's fiscal year as Trump's broad and steep tariffs took effect.Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down to Aa1 from Aaa in May, citing the budget deficit and high borrowing costs associated with rolling over debt at lofty interest rates.The U.S.' finances made \"us think that we need to make an effort to find an alternative way of conducting our liquidity and risk management,\" Schelde said. \"Now we have found such a way and we [are] executing on that.\"Denmark has grown increasingly hostile toward the U.S. as Trump has ratcheted up his calls for control of Greenland to be given to the U.S. Trump said over the weekend that he would institute tariffs on several European nations beginning Feb. 1 if the U.S. did not take control of Greenland and that those levies could rise to 25% on June 1.European leaders have reportedly considered using counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures as a result. Some investors have worried that European countries could dump their U.S. asset holdings in response to Trump's new tariffs.Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Monday that it would \"not be pressured\" and \"stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law.\"Treasury yields in the U.S. and abroad surged Tuesday, a sign of investors feeling geopolitical turmoil rising. The U.S. dollar and stocks fell, and gold rose to new all-time highs in a session defined by the \"sell America\" trade.Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC on Tuesday that sovereign funds could start to dump U.S. investments if they stop seeing the U.S. as a stable trading partner.\"On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy ... U.S. debt and so on.\"Reuters first reported the Danish pension fund's Treasury exit.",

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

    "body": "watch nowFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shouldn't attend upcoming Supreme Court arguments regarding President Donald Trump's efforts to fire one of the central bank's governors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. CNBC reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Powell plans to be present for oral arguments in a case that challenges Trump's power to remove governor Lisa Cook. \"I actually think that's a mistake,\" Bessent told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you're trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that's a mistake.\"Trump said in August he was firing Cook from the Fed's board on mortgage fraud allegations. Cook, however, remains in her post at the central bank. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell on multiple occasions. Bessent's comments come after Powell issued a rare video statement, disclosing he was under criminal investigation. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in the Jan. 11 statement. ",

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg attends the UFC 320 event at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Oct. 4, 2025.Chris Unger | Ufc | Getty ImagesMore than half of all ads on Meta's Instagram ran in the service's short-form video product Reels in 2025, up from 35% in 2024, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.In the U.S., Reels accounted for 46% of time spent on the Instagram app in 2025, up from 37% in 2024, according to the data that Sensor Tower showed CNBC. On the Facebook app, that figure reached 29% in 2025, up from in 2024.The shift highlights the growing role Reels plays in Meta's efforts to drive engagement and advertising revenue across its Instagram and Facebook services.Vertical video continues to be a valuable artificial intelligence play for these social media platforms. Companies such as Meta, Google's YouTube and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time.The platforms' value in AI tools comes from the ability to serve users relevant content, Neuberger Berman senior research analyst Dan Flax said.\"They're surfacing content to the user, and as they get more signals based on what the user watches ... that's helped their recommendation engines get better and you've seen it in the Reels revenue number,\" said Flax.Advertisers have followed this trend, shifting their focus toward short-form video in the past year to reach more consumers on Reels. \"Legacy services are seeing ad volume shift away, with advertisers prioritizing more Reels to meet users where they are,\" Abraham Yousef, a senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC.But the rise of Reels has presented monetization challenges for Meta, as short-form video typically generates less revenue than Instagram's main feed. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out this trade-off during an earnings call in 2023 when Meta stopped paying creators directly for posting Reels.\"Currently, the monetization efficiency of Reels is much less than Feed,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"So the more that Reels grows, even though it adds engagement to the system overall, it takes some time away from Feed and we actually lose money.\" The data shows that while Reels viewership share goes up, so does all activity on the app. Instagram's daily active users figure is up 2% since last year, led by increased usage of Reels, according to Sensor Tower.Meta declined to comment.Analysts say the growing share of viewership on Reels can still translate into higher overall advertising revenue for Meta.\"Even as you substitute some feed at a higher monetization rate than Reels, you still are growing, in totality, the amount of advertising dollars that advertisers are spending with Meta,\" Flax said.Zuckerberg announced on an earnings call in October that Instagram and Facebook Reels had surpassed a $50 billion annual run rate. Analysts will be looking to see how that has grown when Meta reports fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2025 on Jan. 28.A response to TikTokInstagram launched Reels in August 2020, as a direct response to the growing popularity of TikTok. Meta embedded the feature into Facebook the next year.In September, Meta announced that Instagram had amassed 3 billion monthly active users, a major milestone for the photo-sharing app, which was acquired in 2012 for $1 billion.As Reels becomes a larger share of how users and advertisers interact with Meta's apps, the focus shifts to whether the format can remain dominant amid competition from TikTok and YouTube, which offers a similar short-form video product called Shorts.In December, Meta introduced an Instagram TV app that can be used on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices. The app lets users watch Reels on their televisions.\"What Meta has done incredibly well with Reels is that they have gotten better and better with the recommendation engines,\" said Flax. \"I give Mark Zuckerberg and the Meta leadership a lot of credit for wrapping Reels effectively, and I frankly think it has a very strong outlook.\" While Meta's Reels share continues to grow year over year, Sensor Tower's data showed YouTube's watch time for Shorts was flat last year.Nonetheless, YouTube continues to outpace both Instagram and TikTok on mobile, with Sensor Tower estimating the number of U.S. daily active users grew 3% in 2025. TikTok, however, still leads in time spent, with users averaging 81 minutes per day on the app, compared with 80 minutes on YouTube and 55 minutes on Instagram.As that three-way race continues, algorithm-driven vertical video has become a central battleground for how social media companies attract users, sell advertising and sustain growth.WATCH: Meta hires a banker for its AI betwatch now",

South Korea's Kospi was 1.09% lower while the small-cap Kosdaq fell 2.2%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 started the day 0.32% lower.Trump said Saturday that exports from eight European countries would face tariffs of 10% from Feb. 1, rising to 25% by June 1 if talks fail to deliver U.S. control of mineral-rich Greenland.He also threatened to slap 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne, following reports that President Emmanuel Macron was unwilling to join his proposed \"Board of Peace.\" Trump further criticized the U.K., calling its plan to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, which is home to a joint U.K.-U.S. military base, to Mauritius an \"act of great stupidity,\" citing the move as further justification for acquiring Greenland on national security grounds.European leaders have labeled President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats \"unacceptable\" and are reportedly weighing retaliatory measures. France is said to be urging the European Union to deploy its strongest economic response tool, the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument.U.S. stock futures rose slightly in early Asian hours after major averages saw their worst day in three months.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to end the session at 48,488.59.

The Danish Defense will continue the increased presence with exercise activities together with a number of NATO allies in and around Greenland in 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of the European Union resisting his push to annex Greenland \"too much,\" shortly after Denmark sent additional troops to the Arctic island.Speaking ahead of his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum, Trump repeated his desire to take the self-governing Danish territory. The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq. The troops are expected to take part in an a military exercise dubbed \"Arctic Endurance.\"  Danish soldiers disembark an airplane at Nuuk airport, Greenland, on January 19, 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesThe operation, which is centered on countering potential Russian activity, Reuters reported last week, rather than in response to the Trump administration, comes less than a week after several NATO allies deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a separate joint military exercise.Danish government representatives are not expected to attend the World Economic Forum this week, a WEF spokesperson confirmed, as the dispute over Greenland intensifies.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.",

    "body": "watch nowAfter months of speculation and political intrigue, President Donald Trump is close to nominating the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.The president has whittled down the field to four candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell and a decision is forthcoming, Bessent told CNBC during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"My guess is the president will reach a decision maybe as soon as next week,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We've had substantial conversations about this. We've run a process that started in September — 11 very strong candidates. We're now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it's going to be his decision.\"Bessent did not name the four finalists, though previous comments have indicated a field of five that included National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman and BlackRock's chief fixed income strategist, Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have honed in on Hassett, Warsh and Waller, though White House officials have said Rieder also met with Trump, and he has gotten more interest. Recently, Warsh has become the front-runner on Kalshi, with Rieder and Waller trailing, following comments from Trump that he'd prefer Hassett stay in his current role.Bessent has run the screening process but did not indicate a personal preference. White House officials including Trump and the Treasury secretary have regularly criticized Powell both for his stewardship of monetary policy and setting of interest rates, as well as the way he has run the institution in general. Recent developments have seen the Justice Department subpoena Powell relating to the renovation project at Fed headquarters.Trump nominated Powell for the position in 2017, and former President Joe Biden reappointed him.\"Look, I think the Fed's monetary policy independence is very important. I think that a lot of the issues around the independence are being created by the other things that are happening,\" Bessent said. \"Under Chair Powell's watch, we will have seen between four to six governors and presidents have to resign for ethical issues. That's out of 19. If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out.\"Multiple Fed officials, and most recently Governor Adriana Kugler, either have retired or resigned after running afoul of ethics guidelines on investing. \"The independence does not mean lack of accountability. The Fed has a special obligation to the American people because it influences their lives,\" Bessent said.Though Powell's chair term runs out in May, he will have the option to stay on as governor until 2028.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe saga over President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape the Federal Reserve has another twist to it, revolving over whether current Chair Jerome Powell will leave after his term at the helm is finished.Powell is done as the central bank leader on May 15, and it's highly likely Trump will nominate his successor long before then. In fact, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that the long-awaited pick could come as soon as next week.However, Powell's 14-year term as governor stretches to Jan. 31, 2028. Historical precedent has been for almost all outgoing Fed chairs to leave their governor roles as well, but Powell could decide to buck that pattern if he feels threats to central bank independence are stark enough to necessitate him staying. That's what Marriner Eccles did in the late 1940s as he viewed his removal by then-President Harry Truman as a political move.Increasingly vocal Trump has gotten increasingly vocal about controlling the Fed. That has happened through persistent criticism of Powell and his colleagues, his own appointments, as well as saying that he thinks the president should be consulted on interest rate decisions.Some on Wall Street think the prospect of Trump gaining further control of the Fed Board of Governors and using that to steer monetary policy might convince Powell to stay on. Such speculation has heightened in recent days following revelations that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential criminal prosecution and Powell's public statement that a related subpoena is \"pretext\" for Trump in his push to control the Fed.The sequence of events \"makes it much more likely that Powell, [Fed Governor Michael] Barr and others will stay on after May,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a recent note. Though Barr's term runs into 2032, there also had been some chatter that he might choose to walk away. Barr previously had been the vice chair of bank supervision but left the post shortly after Trump's second stint as president began, heading off a potential move by Trump to replace him. He was replaced in the supervisory post by Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee during his first term.Similarly, Philip Jefferson, the vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, also could choose to stay or leave a seat that doesn't expire until January 2036. watch nowBut speculation on the Street is increasing that the threats to Fed independence could raise the possibility that all the current governors stay on. \"We think the probability of Chair Powell remaining on the Board as a governor after his chairmanship expires in May has increased with the release of his statement,\" Nomura economists said in a note. \"Trump's attempt to influence monetary policy could encourage pushback from current FOMC participants.\"Markets see Powell outTraders, though, are betting that Powell leaves.Prediction markets site Kalshi currently has odds on Powell leaving before August 2026 at 70%, a bet that implies he would leave the seat either immediately or shortly after being replaced as chair, assuming Trump's nominee clears the Senate. Sen. Thom Tillis, R- N.C., has vowed to block any Fed appointments until the Department of Justice issue is resolved.For his part, Powell has refrained from addressing the issue. A Fed spokesman contacted by CNBC.com said there would be no comment from the chair's office.At a news conference after the Fed's last meeting in December, Powell also dodged a question about the issue, saying only, \"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair. I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"In the meantime, Trump's efforts to push Powell out of his office could backfire, hardening the position of other Fed officials at a time when the president continues to push for lower rates.\"The bottom line is that Trump's push for Fed compliance ironically may lead to more Fed independence,\" wrote market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research. \"Accordingly, President Trump's appointee for Fed chair may be less able to forge a consensus around his or her views than past Fed chairs have been — giving Trump less control over the Fed's actions than Trump may anticipate.\"watch now",

    "body": "The cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people has declined for the third straight year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.The \"classic\" meal — a 16-pound turkey and sides like stuffing, rolls, sweet potatoes, peas, cranberries and pumpkin pie ingredients — costs an average of $55.18 nationwide, new data from AFBF finds. The estimates come from the farm advocacy group's annual price survey, conducted in the first week of November and based on volunteer shoppers in all 50 states checking grocery store prices for the same Thanksgiving staples each year.The biggest cost is the turkey at an average of $21.50. Other items include 30-ounce pumpkin pie mix at an average cost of $4.16, three pounds of sweet potatoes at $4, one gallon of whole milk at $3.73 and 14 ounces of stuffing mix at $3.71, according to the data.Prices also vary by region, with the classic meal averaging a high of $61.75 in the West and a low of $50.01 in the South.The cost of the classic dinner is down 5% from 2024 and well below the record high of $64.05 reached in 2022. But it's still higher than its 2020 level, when the same meal averaged $46.90. However, with inflation factored in, 2025's price is roughly in line with what the 2020 dinner would cost today.Here's a look at the average price for the last 10 years, according to AFBF's annual survey. Figures are not adjusted for inflation.2015: $50.112016: $49.872017: $49.122018: $48.902019: $48.912020: $46.902021: $53.312022: $64.052023: $61.17 2024: $58.08 Retailers may help keep turkey prices downAt an average price of $21.50, turkey makes up nearly half the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner, according to AFBF data. But even though wholesale turkey prices are up about 75% from last year due to avian flu and higher production costs, shoppers aren't necessarily seeing that increase at the register, according to researchers at Purdue University.That's because grocers often mark down whole frozen turkeys in November, treating the bird as a \"loss leader\" to draw customers into stores for other, higher-margin items, reports industry trade publication Grocery Dive.And those discounts can be steep. Purdue's analysis shows retailers are selling birds well below typical seasonal prices. Walmart, for example, is offering whole turkeys for $0.98 per pound, less than half of Purdue's estimated average retail price for November.Prices for sides are more mixed. Wheat-based items like dinner rolls and stuffing are cheaper, on average, in 2025, while fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes rose sharply due to weather issues and regional supply disruptions, according to AFBF.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Customers check out vegetables and other groceries at a supermarket in Tokyo on June 20, 2025.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's core inflation in October rose at its sharpest rate since July, in line with market estimates on Friday, supporting the case for interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, came in at 3% as expected by economists polled by Reuters. The headline inflation rate rose to 3%, staying above the BOJ's 2% target for 43 straight months.  The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which strips out prices of fresh food and energy, crept up to at 3.1%, compared to 3% in September. Rice inflation continued to ease for a fifth month in a row, dipping to 40.2% from 49.2% in the previous month. Japan's Nikkei 225 was 1.58% lower, while the yen strengthened 0.1% to trade at 157.5 against the dollar as senior Japanese officials voiced concerns on yen moves.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda told the country's parliament on Friday that the central bank should be mindful that a weak yen could affect underlying inflation by pushing up import costs and broader prices.Signaling urgency over yen weakness, Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama reportedly hinted at a possible intervention in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUeda also had his first bilateral meeting with newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi earlier this week.During the meeting, Ueda told Takaichi the central bank was \"gradually raising interest rates to guide inflation smoothly towards its 2% target and ensure the economy achieves sustainable growth,\" Reuters reported. Takaichi has been an advocate of a loose monetary policy, and earlier this month told the country's parliament that she hoped that the BOJ \"conducts policy appropriately\" so that the 2% inflation target is achieved by wage gains instead of cost-push factors.\"The type of inflation we're seeing now is not good,\" Takaichi reportedly said. The BOJ governor also said that Takaichi did not make any request related to monetary policy.The central bank is currently caught between a rock and a hard place, with inflation running above target and GDP growth figures weakening as Japan takes a hit from U.S. tariffs.Japan's GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4% sequentially, and dipping 1.8% on an annualized basis.",

    "body": "Oil drilling rigs and support equipment stand on the tundra in Deadhorse, Alaska, on Friday, Sept. 5, 2025. Nathaniel Wilder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration unveiled plans Thursday for a huge oil drilling expansion off the coasts of Alaska, California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior proposed 34 lease sales to drill in those waters through 2031, a big expansion compared to the Biden administration program that allowed just three lease sales and only in the Gulf. The Trump program would include lease sales in 21 areas off Alaska's coast, six off the Pacific coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico. It would mark the first time since 1984 that Interior has allowed a new lease in the Pacific, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Interior's proposal is not a final program. It still must undergo further review. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accused the Biden administration \"crippling the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production\" by slamming the brakes on oil and gas leasing. More than 100 Democratic lawmakers expressed their opposition to the plan in an Oct. 30 letter addressed to President Donald Trump and Burgum. \"Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Natural Resources Defense Council condemned the Trump plan as egregious and reckless in a post Thursday. \"The proposal would open up untouched waters of Alaska to drilling, attempt to resurrect the offshore oil and gas industry in California, and offer up waters off the coast of Florida that haven't been put up for leasing in decades — in addition to adding even more leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the NRDC said. \"This plan would damage these places, and the people who rely on them, for generations,\" the environmental group said.

The Japanese tech conglomerate recently offloaded its Nvidia shares but still controls British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.South Korea's SK Hynix fell nearly 10%. The memory chip maker is Nvidia's top supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications. Samsung Electronics, a rival that also supplies Nvidia with memory, fell over 5%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker and manufacturer of Nvidia's chip designs, was down over 4% in Taipei. Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which manufactures server racks designed for AI workloads, dipped 4%.The retreat in major Asian semiconductor giants comes after Nvidia fell over 3% in the U.S. on Thursday, despite beating Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter earnings the night before. The company also provided stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance, which analysts said could lift earnings expectations across the sector. However, smaller chip players in Asia were not spared either.In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, fell 2.3%. Tokyo Electron, which provides essential chipmaking equipment to foundries that manufacture Nvidia's chips, was down 5.32%. Another Japanese chip equipment maker, Lasertec, was down over 3.5%.",

    "body": "Shipping container loads dock at Tokyo Bay.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapan's exports in October massively beat expectations, government data on Friday showed, as shipments to Europe and Asia saw robust growth. Exports rose 3.6% year on year compared with Reuters-polled economists' estimates of a 1.1% growth. But it was lower than the 4.2% gain seen in September. Exports to Asia climbed 4.2% and shipments to Western Europe surged 8.8% year on year, helping offset the 2.7% decline to North America as goods shipped to the U.S. fell 3.1%.Automobile shipments, the largest Japanese exports to the U.S. by value, fell 7.5% compared to the same period a year earlier, but softer than the 24.2% decline seen in the prior month. The data comes at a time when Japan is locked in a diplomatic spat with its largest trading partner, China, over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments related to Taiwan. The impact on trade from this spat could show up in next month's data. The Asia Group said in a note on Wednesday that mainland China had suspended imports of seafood from Japan. It also pointed to Chinese social media showing some Japanese brand stores in Shanghai and Beijing \"voluntarily\" closing for several days citing \"reasons that everyone know.\"Meanwhile, imports to the world's fourth largest economy unexpectedly rose 0.7%, defying expectations of a 0.7% fall from the Reuters poll. Stronger-than-expected exports data would come as a welcome relief for Japan's economy that struggled in the third quarter. The country's GDP contracted 0.4% quarter on quarter, with net exports dragging the quarterly figure down by 0.2 percentage point. Japan also released it consumer inflation data on Friday, with headline inflation now running above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 43 months in a row. The Nikkei 225 was 2.38% down after the data release, while the Japanese yen rose marginally to trade at 157.39 against the dollar. Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama signaled the possibility of intervening in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOdds of a December rate cut remained low following the release of delayed jobs data. Markets were last pricing about a 35% chance of a quarter-point cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.The target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.   Those expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. However, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it's been since October 2021. \"All those numbers suggest an economy that's still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other,\" Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don't think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other.\" To be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight. \"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate,\" wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Weak hard data and close-to-target inflation look set to drive policy going forward, despite recent hawkish noises.\" \"The setup is in place for Powell to continue his risk-management approach to the labor market before his term as Chair expires in May,\" Haigh continued.

    "body": "Sale signs inside the Bath and Body Works store in Edmonton. On Thursday, January 6, 2022, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Artur Widak | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works Inc. stock plunged Thursday after the company reported \"disappointing\" third-quarter earnings and slashed its full-year outlook, citing \"macro consumer pressures.\"Shares sank nearly 25% on Thursday and hit a new 52-week low. The stock has plunged more than 50% this year.CEO Daniel Heaf announced a turnaround plan for the company, with expectations of $250 million in cost savings by 2027, aimed at attracting younger consumers and recentering the company's focus to its core products.\"Our third quarter results were below expectations, and we are lowering our outlook for the remainder of the year reflecting current business trends and continuation of recent macro consumer pressures,\" Heaf said in a statement. \"While this is disappointing, we are acting swiftly and decisively to position the business for sustainable, long-term growth.\"Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 35 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expectedRevenue: $1.59 billion vs. $1.63 billion expectedBath & Body reported net income of $77 million, or 37 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 1 compared with $106 million, or 49 cents a share, last year. Adjusting for one-time items including pretax gains, the company reported earnings of 35 cents a share.The company also slashed its yearly guidance due to \"current business trends.\" It also expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down in the high single digits compared with Wall Street estimates of an increase of 1.5%. The guidance, pulling on \"recent negative macro consumer sentiment\" and tariff impacts, also revised net sales guidance for the full year to low single digits.Heaf said the company is reorienting its strategy to focus once again on core products like body care, fragrances and soaps. The plan, called the \"Consumer First Formula,\" includes four strategic priorities: creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting the brand, winning in the marketplace and operating with speed and efficiency.The company had previously toyed with introducing other products like laundry detergent and shampoo, but Heaf said on a call with analysts Thursday that its efforts have not delivered promising results or attracted younger consumers.Heaf said the company will be exiting certain categories like haircare and men's grooming as it refocuses its priorities.\"Over the years, consumers have evolved. They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, emotive storytelling and elevated multi-channel experiences,\" Heaf said. \"Our competitors have risen to meet those needs. We have not.\"Heaf said on the call that the company is also recruiting influencers to \"ignite social buzz\" around the company's products in an attempt to garner attention from new consumers. Bath & Body Works also plans to revamp its app and website to increase engagement and aid in product discovery. The company will also lower its free shipping threshold in early 2026.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on artificial intelligence at the \"Winning the AI Race\" Summit in Washington D.C., U.S., July 23, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersAn executive order that could soon be signed by President Donald Trump would thwart states' artificial intelligence laws by launching legal challenges and withholding federal funding, according to a draft of the order obtained by CNBC on Wednesday.The draft surfaced shortly after Trump publicly called for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"The draft order would give Attorney General Pam Bondi 30 days to establish an \"AI Litigation Task Force\" whose sole task is to challenge state AI laws.Those challenges would be issued \"on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General's judgment,\" the draft says.The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to notify states with contested AI laws that they are ineligible for funds under the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. BEAD is a more than $42 billion program that has allocated funding to all U.S. states and territories.The order, which was first reported by The Information, is not yet finalized. A White House official told CNBC that any discussion around it is just speculation until it is officially announced.As written, the EO would be a major win for the burgeoning AI industry, whose leaders — including Sam Altman's OpenAI, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and other Silicon Valley titans — oppose an inconsistent state-by-state policy approach.It would be just as big a blow to state lawmakers across the country who have sought to pass bills that would place guardrails on the nascent technology.New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, who co-sponsored a state AI safety bill, in a statement to CNBC called the draft EO \"a blank check to Donald Trump's tech billionaire backers who've already made a fortune on — and now stand to profit exponentially more from — allowing unconstrained AI to wipe out jobs, destroy our kids' brains, and drive electricity bills through the roof.\"Bores, a Democrat who is running for Congress, this week became the first target of a well-funded super PAC backed by AI industry leaders.GOP mulls AI moratorium The White House is also working with a group of Republican lawmakers to see if a moratorium on certain state AI laws could be included in one of the major must-pass bills that Congress is working on. That language is still being drafted, but it would likely block states' abilities to regulate on issues like how AI is developed, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. States would likely still be able to craft policy on other AI-related matters such as fraud, consumer protections and images depicting the sexual abuse of children, the sources said.A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill,\" but cut out before Trump signed it in July.The current draft proposal could have no expiration date, including to one source familiar with the discussions. \"You're seeing China move very aggressively,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"AI is the wave of the future, but we want America to be dominant in it and we want our policies to reflect that.\"There is bipartisan support for new federal AI policy — even from those supporting state-level action.\"Let's be clear: we need a federal solution. But we need one that's crafted by experts and doesn't sell you out to the highest bidder. Until then, states must act,\" Bores said in an X post Thursday.But there is also bipartisan opposition to boxing out the states.\"There should not be a moratorium on states rights for AI,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., wrote on X. \"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also shot down the idea of a state-level AI moratorium. \"That provision doesn't appear to have a lot of support amongst Democrats and Republicans in the Congress,\" he told CNBC in a brief hallway interview. \"So I don't know why Donald Trump is bringing it back up at this time.\"Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday morning that he is open to a single national pre-emption.  but it would be a mistake to block states for acting until one is ready. \"If we take away the pressure from the states, Congress will never act,\" Warner said. \"Let's look at the fact we never did anything on social media. If we make that same response on AI and don't put guardrails, I think we'll come [to] rue it.\"— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Shoppers walk past a GAP fashion retail store on Oxford Street on October 30, 2025 in  London, United Kingdom.  John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesApparel retailer Gap said Thursday its comparable sales rose 5% during the fiscal third quarter, driven by strong revenue at its namesake brand after its viral \"Better in Denim\" campaign with girl group Katseye. Putting aside pandemic-related spikes, the rise in comparable sales is the strongest growth for Gap since its fiscal 2017 holiday quarter and is well ahead of Wall Street expectations of 3.1%, according to StreetAccount. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Richard Dickson said the company hasn't needed to discount as often to sell products, it's winning customers from all income cohorts and it's seeing a \"great start\" to the holiday shopping season. \"While external data points to macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are finding our price value, [and] our styles are breaking through the competitive landscape,\" said Dickson. \"Our product is resonating. So we're very confident as we head into the holiday season.\" Shares of Gap rose 5% in extended trading Thursday. Here's how the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S. performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $3.94 billion vs. $3.91 billion expectedThe company's net income during the three months ended Nov. 1 declined nearly 14% to $236 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.94 billion, up 3% from $3.83 billion a year earlier. For Gap's fiscal year, which is slated to end around early February, the company is now guiding to the high end of its previously released sales forecast, expecting sales to rise between 1.7% and 2%, in line with analyst expectations. It previously expected sales to rise between 1% and 2%.The company is now expecting its full-year operating margin to be around 7.2%, compared to its previous range of between 6.7% and 7%. The forecast includes the impact of tariffs, estimated to be between 1 and 1.1 percentage points. Comparable sales across Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic, have been positive now for seven straight quarters. Under Dickson, the company has been as focused on boosting profitability and fixing operations as it has been on reigniting cultural relevance, which has led to sustained sales growth across the portfolio. Gap's profitability had been growing, too, as a result, but now that it's facing tariffs, the retailer's gross margin and net income are both taking a hit. During the quarter, Gap's gross margin fell 0.3 percentage points to 42.4% but still came in higher than expectations of 41.2%, according to StreetAccount. The 14% decline in Gap's net income was primarily related to tariffs, finance chief Katrina O'Connell said in an interview. Gap's better-than-expected results come as apparel sales remain generally soft across the industry and consumers pull back on nice-to-have items like new clothes in favor of necessities. Aside from clear value players like Walmart and TJX Companies, earnings so far this season have been muted, with some companies blaming macroeconomic conditions and expressing caution about the holiday season. Dickson said Gap's varied portfolio gives it a hedge in uncertain economic times because it can capture shoppers in a variety of different places. \"Our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers, which is giving us great flexibility in today's environment,\" said Dickson. Here's a closer look at how each of the company's brands performed: Gap Gap's namesake brand has been the focus of Dickson's turnaround strategy since he took the helm as CEO just over two years ago. During the quarter, comparable sales rose a staggering 7% – more than double the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Revenue rose 6% to $951 million. During the quarter, Gap released its viral \"Milkshake\" campaign, featuring the early-aughts Kelis song and members of the Katseye pop group. The campaign helped sales, but Dickson said Gap brand's growth is \"a story about consistency\" and a mix of better product, marketing and partnerships. Old Navy Sales at Old Navy, Gap's largest brand by revenue, rose 5% to $2.3 billion with comparable sales up 6%, far better than the 3.8% that analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected. The company said it saw growth in key categories like denim, activewear, kids and baby. Banana Republic The elevated, work-friendly brand is still in turnaround mode but saw sales grow 1% to $464 million during the quarter with comparable sales up 4%, better than the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. This was the second quarter in a row Banana reported positive comparable sales, which the company attributed to better marketing and product. Athleta Both revenue and comparable sales at Athleta were down a whopping 11% to $257 million, an eyesore on Gap's otherwise better-than-expected results. Dickson has repeatedly said Athleta is in a reset year, but how long that reset will take remains unclear. \"We have been disappointed in the trend. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but I really do believe in the brand,\" said Dickson. \"I believe in the leadership and we will continue to build this brand for the long term. It does deserve it.\"",

    "body": "Four men have been indicted on federal criminal charges related to a plot to export Nvidia chips worth millions of dollars to China and Hong Kong in violation of tight U.S. restrictions, court documents show.The chips are highly restricted from exports because of their use in artificial intelligence and supercomputing applications, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida.One of the defendants, Brian Curtis Raymond, a 46-year-old resident of Huntsville, Alabama, was identified last week as the chief technology officer of an artificial intelligence cloud company in Virginia that announced plans for a merger that would allow its stock to be publicly traded. That company is not implicated in the case, and told CNBC that his job offer has been rescinded.Raymond and the other three defendants, all of whom were born in China or Hong Kong, are charged with conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 in connection with the export and attempted export of the Nvidia chips to end users in China and Hong Kong, after first shipping the chips to Malaysia and Thailand. The defendants had not obtained a license or authorization for such exports from the Commerce Department, according to the indictment.The indictment was first reported by CourtWatch, the court document aggregation news site founded by counterrorism researcher Seamus Hughes.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, which is prosecuting the case, said that 400 Nvidia A100 chips were exported to China as part of the scheme from October 2024 and January in two separate shipments. \"The third and fourth exports to [China] were disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed,\" the office said. \"These attempted exports related to ten Hewlett Packard Enterprises supercomputers containing NVIDIA H100 GPUs and 50 separate NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\"The indictment notes that China \"is rapidly developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and has announced its intent to be the world leader in AI by 2030.\"\"These capabilities are being used by the PRC [People's Republic of China] for its military modernization efforts and in connection with the PRC's weapons design and testing, including for weapons or mass destruction,\" the indictment says.Raymond owned a technology products distributor company in Huntsville, which was \"licensed to sell Nvidia GPUs [graphics processing units], among other products,\" the indictment says. Raymond's LinkedIn page says his company, Bitworks, is or was a \"Nvidia Cloud Partner delivering H100, H200, and coming Blackwell / NVL72 clusters for customers.\"Raymond and another co-defendant in the case, Mathew Ho, would \"cause freight forwarded to chip Nvidia GPUs to third countries, knowing that the GPUs were ultimately destined for and would be transhipped to the\" People's Republic of China,  the indictment alleges. Ho, a 34-year-old who was born in Hong Kong, is a U.S. citizen who lives in Florida. He is also known as Hon Ning Ho.Ho was the registered agent of a company in Tampa called Janford Realtor, which, despite its name, was never involved in any real estate transactions, but instead \"served as an intermediary for several unlawful and unlicensed exports to\" China of the advanced and highly-controlled chips, the indictment says.As part of the alleged conspiracy, Ho and Raymond would submit documents related to the shipments that contained false information about the ultimate cosignors for the chips, the value of the chips and the licenses required for their export, the indictment says.Raymond was arrested on Wednesday and later appeared in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. His wife declined to comment.Raymond's lawyer, Tae Lee, declined to comment on the charges.On Nov. 10, three days before the indictment was filed in Tampa, Raymond was identified in a press release issued by Corvex, an Arlington, Virginia-based AI cloud company, as its chief technology officer.The press release said Corvex and Movano Health, a publicly traded company that sells medical wearables, had agreed to a merger that would enable Corvex to become publicly traded. A Corvex spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC after being asked about Raymond, said, \"Corvex had no part in the activities cited in the Department of Justice's indictment.\"\"The person in question is not an employee of Corvex. Previously a consultant to the company, he was transitioning into an employee role but that offer has been rescinded,\" the spokesperson saidIn addition to the top count of conspiracy, Raymond is charged with two counts of violations of the Export Control Reform Act in connection with an attempt to export 50 Nvidia H200 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year, and the attempted export of about 10 HP supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year. He is also charged with one count of smuggling goods from the United States related to the attempted export of the 50 Nvidia H200 chips.Raymond is also charged with seven counts of money laundering related to wire transfers totaling more than $3.4 million from a bank account for a company in China to a bank account belonging to Raymond's company in Huntsville, and to Janford Realtor.Ho and the two other defendants in the case, Jing Chen and Cham Li, were all arrested in recent days, according to court documents.Those three men, as part of the alleged conspiracy, would identify customers in China who wanted to buy the Nvidia chips, the indictment says.Ho and Chen, a 45-year-old also known as Harry Chen, were arrested in Tampa. They are being held without bail. In addition to the conspiracy count, Ho is charged with nine money laundering counts in connection with $4 million in wire transfers from the bank account for the Chinese company to Janford Realtor and to Raymond's company. He is also charged with four counts of violating the Export Control Reform Act, and three counts of smuggling.Ho's lawyer, Samuel Williams, declined to comment on the case.Chen is a Chinese national who entered the U.S. on a student visa and who resides in Tampa.He is charged with conspiracy, one count of violating the ECRA, and one count of smuggling.Information about Chen's lawyer was not publicly available.Li, a 38-year-old also known as Tony Li, was arrested in California and was due to appear in Oakland federal court on Thursday. Information about Li's lawyer was not available. A Chinese national who lives in California, Li was identified as a manager of Janford Realtor, according to the indictment.He is charged with a single count each of conspiracy, violating the ECRA and smuggling.All four defendants face a possible maximum sentence if convicted of 20 years in prison.— CNBC's Samantha Subin contributed to this story.",

    "body": "watch nowCleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle.The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is \"barely restrictive, if at all\" when it comes to the economic impact. Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices.\"I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective,\" she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place.\"Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is \"right around a neutral rate,\" indicating it does not need to come down much further.Hammack will be a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee next year. The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members.While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet.\"What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them,\" she said. \"We are in this slow,  this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $50, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them.\"Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture \"mixed\" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate. Correction: Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack will be a member of the FOMC next year. An earlier version of this story misstated when she would serve on the rate-setting committee. The story also misstated a number. Hammack had said, \"What used to cost $30 now costs $50...\" watch now",

    "body": "watch nowImprovement in mortgage rates at the end of the summer boosted home sales, but that gain may be short-lived.Sales of previously owned homes in October rose 1.2% from September to 4.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were up 1.7% year over year. This count is based on home closings, so contracts likely signed in August and September. While contract signings would not be impacted by the government shutdown that started in October, closings, especially those requiring flood insurance or government-backed rural home loans, could be.During that contract-signing period, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage came down for a bit but then moved up again. The popular 30-year rate started August at 6.63%, fell steadily to 6.13% by mid-September, and then came back up to 6.37% by the end of the month, according to Mortgage News Daily. It now stands at 6.36%.The inventory of homes for sale has also come down. After gaining for much of this year, supply fell to 1.52 million units, down 0.7% from September, although still nearly 11% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.4-month supply, still considered lean.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.And that's why prices are still gaining. The median price of a home sold in October was $415,200, an increase of 2.1% from October 2024 and the 28th consecutive month of annual gains. \"Looking ahead, home shoppers in today's market face some advantages from falling mortgage rates and seasonally slower competition,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"At the same time, a lack of housing affordability continues to be a challenge keeping home sales in their historically low level.\"Homes are staying on the market longer, at an average of 34 days last month compared with 29 days last October. First-time buyers made a comeback in the market, representing 32% of sales, up from 27% a year ago — but not all regions are equal. \"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"Sales growth continues to be strongest on the high end of the market. Homes priced above $1 million saw sales up more than 16% from a year ago, and those priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw a gain of 10%. Meanwhile sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 were up just about 1%, and homes priced below $100,000 saw a drop in sales of nearly 3%. ",

    "body": "watch nowOne week into what baristas have threatened to make the \"largest, longest\" strike in Starbucks' history, the Workers United union said it is adding more than two dozen new cities and stores to its strike count. The union said Thursday it will now be striking at 95 stores in 65 cities, with some 2,000 baristas now engaged in the action. On Wednesday, baristas and allies also picketed and held a rally outside of the company's distribution center in York, Pa. Starbucks said there were no disruptions to its operations in York.Workers United said the majority of stores where strikes were held had to close down on the first day of the strike due to staffing issues, and the lack of workers impacted some 50 locations in the days to follow. Starbucks said stores that had issues were often able to reopen quickly and that less than 1% of its locations are experiencing disruption from the strike.The strike has so far not appeared to dent foot traffic and sales, according to the company and data from Placer.ai. The location intelligence tracking firm's data show foot traffic on Red Cup Day, when the strike was launched, was up 44.5% compared to the daily average between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14 this year.In a memo to workers last week, CEO Brian Niccol touted the success of the holiday launch so far. \"Together, we set new records. Last Thursday's Holiday launch was our biggest sales day ever in North America. Then yesterday, we had our strongest Reusable Red Cup day in company history,\" the memo sent Friday said. Starbucks workers walk a picket line as they go on strike outside a Starbucks store on Nov. 13, 2025 in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe union began organizing at Starbucks in 2021 and says it now represents more than 11,000 workers across more than 550 stores. This week, it said five non-union stores filed for union elections, including locations in the Baltimore, Md. area, Harrisonburg, Va., and Little Rock, Ark. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers. Workers United is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.The strike has threatened to hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.Starbucks maintains it will be ready to serve customers across its stores this holiday season.\"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement regarding the strike escalation.\"Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" Anderson said. \"The facts are clear, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here—our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. economy added substantially more jobs than expected in September, according to a long-awaited report Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 in the month, up from the 4,000 jobs lost in August following a downward revision. The Dow Jones consensus estimate for September was 50,000. The July total also was revised down to 72,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the prior release.In addition to the headline jobs number, the BLS said the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.4%, the highest it's been since October 2021. A broader measure that includes those not looking for jobs or working part-time for economic reasons edged lower to 8%.Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% for the month and 3.8% from a year ago, compared to respective forecasts for 0.3% and 3.7%.The report ends a data drought on the labor market that began in early September and continued through the record 44-day government shutdown. Agencies including the BLS, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and others were prohibited from collecting or releasing data during the period.This was the first BLS jobs report since the count for August that was released Sept. 5. It also was the second since Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1, following a July jobs report that contained massive revisions for prior months.\"September's jobs report shows the labor market still had resilience before the shutdown, beating payroll expectations, but the picture remains muddy with August jobs revised to a job loss and the unemployment rate increasing,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"These numbers are a snapshot from two months ago and they don't reflect where we stand now in November.\"A 'Now Hiring' sign sits outside the entrance to a Burlington department store on Nov. 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesStock market futures nevertheless added to gains following the report while Treasury yields were mostly lower. Traders also continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will not lower rates further at its Dec. 9-10 meeting. This is the last jobs report Fed policymakers will get before then. Hawkish talk out of the October Fed meeting, as reflected in minutes released Wednesday, contributed to a general feeling that the central bank will be on hold into the end of the year.\"Despite the fact that today's jobs report is very backward looking, it's making markets move,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Equities like the fact that payrolls were stronger than expected, suggesting the economy is still on a firm footing, while the bond market likes the rise in unemployment and slowdown in wage growth which may keep the case for a December Fed cut just about alive.\"Overall, the report shows the labor market entered the autumn months on much the same footing it has been all year – a slow but steady pace, with firms reluctant both to hire many new workers or lay off existing workforce during a time of unusual economic volatility spurred by aggressive policy actions in President Donald Trump's White House.A separate Labor Department release Thursday showed that initial jobless claims totaled 220,000 for the week ending Nov. 15, down 8,000 from the prior period and lower than the consensus forecast for 227,000.Job gains in September came from familiar sources, with health care leading at 43,000, about right on target with its pace over the past year. Bars and restaurants contributed 37,000 while social assistance added 14,000. On the downside, transportation and warehousing lost 25,000 and federal government, which had been a large contributor to employment growth, was off 3,000, part of a loss of 97,000 on the calendar year. Professional and business services also reported a decline of 20,000, fueled by a drop of 16,000 in temporary help. The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, painted an even brighter picture of the labor market.The total level of those employed rose by 251,000 while the labor force increased by 470,000 to a fresh record of 171.2 million. The participation rate, which measures the share of the working-age population either working or seeking employment, edged higher to 62.4, the highest since May.The rolls of full-time employment swelled by 673,000 while part-times fell by 573,000.The lack of comprehensive indicators has presented a challenge for Fed officials, who cut their benchmark interest rate in both September and October but face a tougher decision in December. Officials at the October meeting noted the difficulty in navigating policy without the usual array of economic metrics to rely on, and there was a significant inclination to forgo a December cut, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday.With September's payrolls count released, the BLS is preparing the first influx of other data in coming months. The bureau on Wednesday announced it will release jobs data for October and November simultaneously on Dec. 16. October's numbers will not include the customary unemployment rate calculation as that comes from a survey of households that will not be able to be completed because of the shutdown.",

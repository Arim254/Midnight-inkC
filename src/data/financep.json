    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersChina has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its \"mistakes\" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should \"immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.\"\"What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. Read moreNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The housing market has spent the past few years stuck with high prices and slow sales. But in 2026, conditions are expected to ease slightly for buyers, a shift Redfin describes as a \"reset\" year.That reset is being driven by a growing supply of homes after years of limited inventory, which may push prices down in some markets next year. Overall, home prices have mostly leveled off over the past two years, as new construction has picked up. And there are already signs the market is loosening: Homes are sitting on the market longer, negotiations are becoming more common, and builders are offering discounts in markets where the supply of newly constructed homes has increased, according to Realtor.com.That doesn't mean homes will suddenly become affordable nationwide. Median home prices are still too high for many buyers after rising by 25% since 2020, according to U.S. Census data. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are also expected to remain elevated above 6% in 2026, limiting how much relief buyers are likely to see.In some markets, though, builders are increasingly using price cuts and incentives to move inventory, giving buyers more leverage, even though affordability remains tight overall.\"The bottom line for 2026 is that it will be a transitional year,\" Chris Reis, a broker with Compass in Seattle, tells CNBC Make It. \"There won't be a crash or a boom, just the market finding its footing after years of extraordinary disruption. Buyers will have more selection and negotiating power than at any time since the pandemic.\"What to expect in 2026Most housing forecasts point to a market that looks more stable than dramatic: Home prices are expected to rise slowly, and mortgage rates might dip modestly, although borrowing costs will still make buying expensive for many households. Here's how several major forecasters expect U.S. home prices to change in 2026:Redfin: +1.0%Realtor.com: +2.2%Zillow: +1.2%Fannie Mae: +1.3%Meanwhile, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% in 2026, where they've been for the past three years. The current average rate is about 6.2%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Here's where major forecasters expect rates to land next year:Redfin: 6.3%Realtor.com: 6.3%Fannie Mae: 5.9%Mortgage Bankers Association: Low-to-mid 6% range While there may not be a lot of cost relief in home prices or mortgage rates, buyers are seeing more negotiating room where housing supply has increased — particularly in new construction.That's because builders sitting on recently completed homes are more willing to make deals, says Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.\"Quick move-in inventory is readily available, and builders are cutting prices and offering incentives to get it sold,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. That flexibility is less common in the current housing market, where many homeowners remain locked into lower mortgage rates and have little incentive to sell.Where prices could decline in 2026Home-price trends in 2026 are expected to vary widely by metropolitan area.While prices will keep rising modestly in many parts of the country, some large housing markets are expected to see flat or declining prices, particularly across parts of the West and South, per Realtor.com. In those areas, buyers may find more room to negotiate.Based on Realtor.com's 2026 forecast, these are 10 of the 100 largest U.S. metros expected to see the biggest year-over-year home-price declines next year:Cape Coral–Fort Myers, Florida: −10.2% North Port–Sarasota–Bradenton, Florida: −8.9% Stockton–Lodi, California: −4.1% Raleigh, North Carolina: −3.7% Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida: −3.6% Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, Florida: −3.6% Spokane–Spokane Valley, Washington: −3.5% Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, Colorado: −3.4% Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, California: −3.3% San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, California: −2.5%Realtor.com's projections estimate 2026 home-price changes by factoring in inventory, mortgage-rate expectations, and local economic conditions.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Colleen McCarthy was working a corporate job she was never \"super excited about\" when she started creating floral arrangements in her free time.Two years later, she's designed floral arrangements for stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Drew Barrymore through her business Colleen Rose Florals.McCarthy, 27, grew up in Ridgefield, CT. She majored in environmental studies and communications at Fordham University, but after she graduated in 2020, \"it was hard to find a job, period, let alone a job that I really wanted to do,\" she says.She landed a job at a PR agency, but viewed the job as a \"temporary thing\" while she figured out her long-term plan.A couple years into her job, McCarthy says she had a \"mini quarter-life crisis\" about her career. She took a step back to reflect: \"What do I like? What have I always liked? What am I good at?\"McCarthy has always loved flowers — \"I would always be the person in my apartment who would buy flowers from the grocery store and arrange them nicely,\" she says — so when she came across floral design as a potential creative career, she decided to give it a try.In late 2022, McCarthy took an introductory class at Flower School New York, a floral design education institution. Beginner classes currently cost about $175, per their website.\"I remember the instructor came over to me, and she was like, 'Oh, is this your first class?' And I said, yeah. And she was like, 'It doesn't seem like it. You seem to have a natural talent for this,'\" she recalls. Hearing that gave her McCarthy the confidence to seriously pursue floral design, she says. 'I just started telling people I was a florist'While still working her full-time job, McCarthy started buying grocery store flowers each week to practice making her floral designs, and she began sharing her work on Instagram and TikTok and in several local Facebook groups.Social media was \"really huge\" in helping McCarthy grow her business, she says. \"I just started telling people I was a florist, even though I wasn't really that established,\" she says. \"I think just telling myself and telling other people, like, 'Yeah, I'm a florist,' it made it happen more easily.\"McCarthy holding one of her floral designs.Jenna Yandle PhotographyHer first official sale was to a member of one of the Facebook groups in March 2023.\"I was just so excited, just the fact that someone would pay for my work,\" she says. \"That was also really validating.\"In May 2023, McCarthy officially registered Colleen Rose Florals as an LLC – a costly process, she says, but ultimately worth it.\"I don't regret it at all, because then I had all the official stuff done, and then when I really started getting more traction and getting more business, I was happy that I had that,\" she says.McCarthy started working with event planners to design florals for brand events, and even booked her first wedding at the end of 2023.\"After I did that, it also gave me so much more confidence that I could do larger-scale events and figure it out,\" she recalls.Focusing on floralsHalfway through 2024, McCarthy says she started to \"really consider\" quitting her day job.\"There were more and more instances where I was having to turn down flower jobs because of my nine to five,\" she says. \"That was kind of a tipping point, I think, because I was like, 'Wait a second, I would like to be saying yes to these opportunities.'\" In December 2024, McCarthy decided to leave her job to focus on running Colleen Rose Florals.\"I kind of was pretty confident that I would be successful,\" she says. \"I didn't really feel nervous or scared about it. I think maybe my mom was a little more nervous than I was.\"In 2025, the first year she focused on the business full-time, Colleen Rose Florals brought in over $175,000.An arrangement McCarthy designed for a brand event.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyHer main business expense, naturally, is flowers. High-quality blooms are \"really expensive,\" she says, and \"there's a disconnect between what the average consumer thinks flowers cost, and what flowers actually cost.\"McCarthy provides floral arrangements for a variety of occasions, including weddings, brand events, book launches, photoshoots and even concerts.She charges a minimum of $250 for a single \"bespoke\" floral arrangement and typically charges $1,000 or above for smaller events, while small-to-medium weddings can cost between $5,000 and $10,000.Starting in the spring of 2024, Madison Square Garden began commissioning floral arrangements from McCarthy to decorate artists' dressing rooms. This year, she's provided bouquets for the dressing rooms of stars like Katy Perry, Lainey Wilson, Haim and Renee Rapp.One of her most exciting moments was being asked to create a bouquet for Sabrina Carpenter in October.\"That was so exciting and validating, that someone felt confident enough in me to order my work for a huge artist,\" she recalls.A floral arrangement that McCarthy designed for Sabrina Carpenter's dressing room at Madison Square Garden.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyLooking aheadRight now, Colleen Rose Florals is a solo operation, though McCarthy sometimes hires freelancers to help out with large events.Every day running her floral business is \"super different,\" she says, but she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. to buy flowers from Manhattan's flower district.She typically starts preparing for major events the day before, she says, and depending on the scale of the event, she either takes the flowers back to her apartment, or rents a studio space for the day. McCarthy has to \"process\" each flower – a \"pretty time-consuming\" task of taking off the leaves, cutting the stem, peeling off any old petals, and putting it in water – before she can start working on her arrangements.Once she's finished with her designs, she transports them to the venue by hiring a driver or renting a van herself.A bouquet McCarthy designed for an engagement party.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyAs a solo business owner, one of the biggest lessons she's learned has been \"knowing when to ask for help,\" she says. \"There have been a couple times where I pulled an all-nighter to finish everything, or I made all these arrangements by myself, when it would have taken half the time if I just asked for help,\" she says.McCarthy's main business goals for 2026 are to rent a permanent studio space and to launch a weekly floral arrangement subscription program as a way to create \"another consistent stream of income.\"She still posts her floral designs on social media, and often receives messages from aspiring florists hoping to learn about her career journey.\"That used to be me, reaching out to florists, wanting to learn from them,\" McCarthy says. \"The fact that I am now someone that others are inspired by is really crazy.\"\"It makes me feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing,\" she continues.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The composite PMI, a broader measure that tracks activity across manufacturing and services, climbed to 50.7 from 49.7 in November, pointing to broader improvement across the economy.China's non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, increased to 50.2 from 49.5 in November.Huo Lihui, chief statistician from China's National Bureau of Statistics, said that new orders rose in December, signaling a \"significant expansion\" in both production and demand in manufacturing.Private-sector data showed a similar trend. A separate PMI from independent research firm RatingDog showed manufacturing activity rising to 50.1 from 49.9, beating expectations of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog, said the reading indicated the manufacturing sector had returned to expansion. He noted that total new orders grew for a seventh consecutive month, supported by domestic new product launches and business development, leading to growth in production.However, Yao said that while firms remain confident for 2026, optimism has eased and remained below the historical average.Large enterprises drove the improvement, with their PMI rising to 50.8, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Activity among smaller firms remained weaker. The PMI for medium-sized enterprises rose to 49.8, while the index for small enterprises fell to 48.6, down 0.5 percentage points from November.Markets were mixed after the release. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.83%, while the mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.33%. The data followed a decision by China's central bank earlier this week to keep loan prime rates unchanged, despite weak economic data and an extended slump in the property sector plaguing the world's second-largest economy.November's retail sales and industrial output missed expectations, while investment in fixed assets also contracted. Hao Zhou, chief economist at securities company Guotai Junan International, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday that the reading was a \"very good, positive surprise to the market.\"\"Maybe the market is concerned about China's property market, China stock market, as well as the consumption,\" Zhou said. \"The data for now suggests that the economy is on the right trend, and the momentum remains solid.\"",

Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the artificial intelligence boom.Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing delivery estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook.Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Read moreTesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight annual drop.Tesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. Shares of Tesla were up slightly in afternoon trading Wednesday. The company's stock has gained more than 12.5% in 2025.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.Correction: An earlier version of this story used deliveries and sales interchangeably.

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks as Apple holds an event at the Steve Jobs Theater on its campus in Cupertino, California, Sept. 9, 2025.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersApple has one heck of a mulligan coming ahead of its 50th anniversary in 2026.After failing on its promise to launch an artificial intelligence-supercharged version of Siri in March, Apple said it's on track to make it happen in the new year.The stakes are enormous. Apple's AI failure this year put even more pressure on it to deliver a breakthrough AI experience on the iPhone. Another whiff like that will only cement the idea that Apple is woefully behind its peers in AI and risks losing control over the next major computing platform to a rival like Google or a startup like OpenAI.Not only that, Apple must prove to investors that AI can generate meaningful sales growth after years of post-pandemic stagnation.How Apple got hereWe knew it was going to be a challenging 2025 for Apple long before the calendar turned over to the new year.With President Donald Trump's inauguration looming, no major tech company was more exposed to his impending tariff scheme than Apple.And then there was the looming AI question. Apple launched limited features for its Apple Intelligence system in the fall, but the real update, an AI-powered version of Siri that Apple advertised as a key feature in the iPhone 16, was scheduled to launch early in 2025. Apple shares were reaching new highs in anticipation of a groundbreaking AI experience built into the iPhone. It was all for nothing. It took months for Apple CEO Tim Cook to play the politician and woo the president with the promise of $600 billion in U.S. investments over the next four years, culminating in a stunning moment in the Oval Office when Cook gave the president a glass trophy with a solid gold base. The ploy worked. Even though analysts pointed out most of Cook's promised spending was already baked in, the president thought it was good enough. Trump dropped his demands for Apple to build iPhones on U.S. soil and gave Cook the tariff relief he wanted. With the tariff problem out of the way, Apple shares surged. The stock is up about 35% since that show in the Oval Office.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere. China may be the first to make it a realityMeta acquires intelligent agent firm Manus, capping year of aggressive AI movesSoftbank to buy data center firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion in AI pushCalifornia's Ro Khanna faces Silicon Valley backlash after embracing wealth taxLet's try that again...Now, Apple has to solve its AI problem. Following an exodus of top execs, including AI boss John Giannandrea, Apple said it has the team in place to deliver the Siri upgrade in 2026, which could come as much as 21 months after the original announcement.Apple needs that new Siri to be good. Not just good enough to match the capabilities of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, but also good enough to convince folks with older iPhones to upgrade to a new device so they can use it. Users need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to use Apple Intelligence.That was the Apple bull case a year ago. That Apple Intelligence, especially the new version of Siri, was going to be so amazing that people would get a new iPhone just to use it. That elusive iPhone \"super cycle\" was on the horizon. Nope. Perhaps next year. For investors, it's their best bet to see a boom in Apple shares from AI.Unlike the $20 per month OpenAI charges to use the full version of ChatGPT, Apple doesn't charge for Apple Intelligence. Unless Apple changes its strategy and starts charging a subscription, its only hope is to leverage AI to move new iPhones, Macs and iPads. It also opens up Apple to launch different kinds of hardware products, like the rumored smart glasses that could come as soon as next fall. But don't count on an accessory like that moving the needle too much at Apple. Apple rarely misses the way it did with AI this year, especially with something as important and as transformative as AI. Luckily for Apple, it's still early in the AI game. And it proved this year with the iPhone 17 lineup that new hardware designs and features can lead to sales growth. But it can only miss once. There's not going to be another chance for a mulligan.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAt a challenging time for the restaurant industry, major chains like Chipotle and Cava are putting money behind automated makelines from startup Hyphen.The San Jose, California-based company aims to help restaurants achieve two key goals in a hyper-competitive environment: speedy throughput and good customer service. The technology makes for a less chaotic and more \"elegant experience\" for workers and guests alike, co-founder and CEO Stephen Klein told CNBC in an interview. \"We're probably making a bowl every 10 to 15 seconds. At peak throughput, we have more capacity usually than they do demand, especially ... for lunch and dinner rushes,\" Klein said.That efficiency has brought increased interest across the industry. In August 2025, Hyphen closed a Series B round of financing that included up to $10 million from Cava. Chipotle said it has invested a total of $25 million into Hyphen via its Cultivate Next venture fund through the third quarter of 2025. The $25 million Series B round will help Hyphen scale its production and rollout across restaurants in the U.S. Its production will ramp with Re:Build Manufacturing, a company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Chipotle's Hyphen makeline is in San Jose for modification after an in-restaurant test. Cava will test and pilot its tech for a second makeline to serve digital and takeout orders in the back of its kitchen in the future.A finished burrito bowl assembled by Chipotle and Hyphen's automation technology.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillHyphen's technology solves for both a speed and labor issue, helping to automate part of the service process that can be repetitive and challenging to fill. \"You can have, somebody is selling ingredients on top, while the rest of this stuff is happening underneath,\" he said of the makeline, which relies on a series of robotic hands to prep salads and bowls under a long table, out of public view, sending them down the row.The makelines cost between $50,000 and $100,000 to purchase, and restaurant customers are often getting a return on investment in under a year, Klein said. They operate 95% of the time, but during the rare moments they're down, workers can jump in to complete orders, the way an escalator would turn into stairs, he said.Another key feature is cutting down on food waste. The technology tracks ingredients \"down to the gram,\" Klein said.\"We're perfectly portioning every ingredient, we're able to help them save on food costs, or at least reduce food costs in some way,\" he said. The idea of the company began when Klein and his co-founder Daniel Fukuba built a fully robotic food truck, which launched in Los Angeles three months before the pandemic started. They changed gears to launch Hyphen soon after that.\"When the pandemic happened, we kind of just had to share that into another direction. We had luckily been talking to other restaurant partners about licensing our technology for them, and we decided ... it just made a lot more sense to help restaurants that are already around today,\" Klein said.Technology innovation will likely continue to be a key trend in the restaurant sector after a brutal year for many of the industry's leaders. Shares of Cava and Chipotle are down nearly 50% and 40% year-to-date, respectively, after pullbacks from key demographics including younger consumers. Sweetgreen, another competitor in the healthy salad and bowl space, is down nearly 80% on the year. Sweetgreen sold its robotics unit, Spyce, to mealtime platform Wonder earlier this year for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen had acquired Spyce to build its automated Infinite Kitchens, and it will continue to use the technology.Klein said Hyphen is talking to major brands and food service providers for college campuses and office parks as it looks to not only evolve the makeline, but also provide data that comes from the food prep and distribution. The company aims to develop more software in the future, including tools for food prep scheduling to be used in the back of the house. One area that's not on the menu, at least for now, is the fast food sector.\"We're really trying to help people that have really a high mix or high customization in terms of what their guests are ordering, as well as high volume. So that's kind of our strike zone,\" he said. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold and silver prices lost ground on Wednesday as investors booked profits after a historic annual rally and exchange operator CME Group hiked the margins on precious metal futures for the second time in the space of a week.Spot gold prices dipped 0.1% to $4,339.89 per ounce at 8:50 a.m. ET, extending losses in the run-up to the new year. The yellow metal notched a one-week low in the previous session.Spot silver prices, meanwhile, tumbled 5.6% to $72.15 per ounce, paring gains after climbing above $80 for the first time at the start of the week.The moves come at the end of a blockbuster year for the precious metals.Gold is up more than 64% year to date, on track for its best annual performance since 1979 and third straight positive year. The rally has been supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.  Silver has far outpaced gold in 2025. The metal, which has endured wild price swings in recent days, is on course for annual gains of nearly 150%. Like gold, this would be silver's best yearly performance since 1979. Silver's price boom has stemmed from a mix of low supply and high demand from India, as well as industrial needs and tariffs.watch nowCME Group, one of the world's largest trading floors for commodities, said Tuesday that margins for gold, silver, platinum and palladium would increase again after the close of business Wednesday.

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates are lower, home prices are easing and there is more supply on the market for sale. All of that adds up to improved affordability for today's homebuyers. Saving for a down payment, however, is still the biggest hurdle for first-time buyers. Prices nationally are basically flat compared with where they were a year ago, according to Parcl Labs, which runs daily studies of U.S. home prices. They dipped into negative territory earlier this month and are now just 0.3% higher year over year. The latest S&P Cotality Case-Shiller home price index, which reflects pricing from October, showed large disparities among metropolitan markets. Of the top 20 markets it highlights, Chicago; New York; and Cleveland had the biggest gains. Meanwhile eight cities showed prices in negative territory, with Tampa, Florida; Phoenix; and Dallas seeing the biggest losses. \"National home prices also continue to lag consumer inflation, as October's CPI is estimated around 3.1% (based on a provisional index the U.S. Treasury announced due to the federal data shutdown) – roughly 1.8 percentage points higher than the latest housing appreciation. In real terms, that gap implies a slight decline in inflation-adjusted home values over the past year,\" explained Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a release.Mortgage rates, too, are coming down. The average on the 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. It started this year well over 7%. That decline means significant savings for homebuyers. For example, for a buyer putting down 20% on a $410,000 home (right around the national median), the monthly payment today is $200 less on average than it would have been a year ago. Weaker prices and lower rates are changing the math on what first-time buyers can afford. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The typical homebuyer now needs seven years to save for a down payment, according to Realtor.com. That's down from the recent peak of 12 years in 2022, but still roughly double pre-pandemic levels, partly because the personal savings rate is so much lower than it was in 2020. Down payments continue to be the biggest hurdle to homeownership, which in the second half of this year fell to 65%, according to the U.S. Census, the lowest level since 2019.But an improved supply of homes for sale is adding momentum to the market. Active listings are now about 12% higher than they were a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but still 6% lower than they were just pre-pandemic.And buyers appear to be responding. Pending home sales, which count signed contracts on existing homes, rose more than expected in November. They were 3.3% higher than October, 2.6% higher than November 2024 and hit the highest level in nearly three years, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"Improving housing affordability–driven by lower mortgage rates and wage growth rising faster than home prices–is helping buyers test the market. More inventory choices compared to last year are also attracting more buyers to the market,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, in a release. ",

Iranian military sites and weapons programs were damaged earlier this year by attacks carried out by Israel and the U.S.Trump, ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday, also said he would support Israeli strikes on Iran in the event of rearmament.\"The response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable,\" Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian posted to X on Tuesday.Trump has also taken an aggressive stance toward Venezuela of late, targeting alleged drug boats, ordering a complete blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country, and designating the country's government a \"foreign terrorist organization.\"Earlier this month, the Trump administration said the U.S. had seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. The seized tanker had been sanctioned by the U.S. for years and transported oil from Iran and Venezuela, according to a post from Attorney General Pam Bondi.And at the meeting on Monday with Netanyahu, Trump also confirmed an attack on an alleged drug loading facility on Venezuelan soil. CNN reported that the attack was carried out earlier this month by the CIA. Tuesday's sanctions follow similar efforts in October and November to target individuals and entities operating in or involved with Iranian weapons networks.\"Treasury is holding Iran and Venezuela accountable for their aggressive and reckless proliferation of deadly weapons around the world,\" John K. Hurley, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement.\"We will continue to take swift action to deprive those who enable Iran's military-industrial complex access to the U.S. financial system,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowSoftBank has completed its $40 billion investment commitment to OpenAI, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to sources familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the transaction. SoftBank had previously invested $7.5 billion in the ChatGPT maker and syndicated another $11 billion with co-investors, the Japanese conglomerate confirmed in a press release, with the final aggregate commitment at $41 billion. The investment takes SoftBank's stake in the company to around 11%.CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation. At the time, Faber reported that the funding would be paid out over a 12-to-24-month period.

OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments over the next several years, including agreements with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom.Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaker Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge to strengthen its AI push. Last month, SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary Nvidia. A different source familiar with the move to sell the stake told CNBC at the time that the sale, combined with other cash sources, would support its OpenAI investment.The startup, which is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, has received billions in funding over the years from tech juggernaut Microsoft.

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019, as officials debated the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting — 12 vote on rates — indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half-percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

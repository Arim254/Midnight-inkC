    "body": "Certain people seem so effortlessly influential, they make you wonder if they were born with some magical quality. But after researching human behavior for 15 years, I have good news. Influence is a set of learnable actions, not a fixed personality trait. In my book, \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need From the People in Charge,\" I break down how to build authority at work based on my experience advising thousands of top performers at companies like Google, Amazon, and JPMorgan. There are things you can do to be taken more seriously, get your ideas approved, and become someone leadership seeks out — even if you're introverted, still working your way up the ladder, or new to your industry. Here are five of the most powerful behaviors you can start using right now — based on five different types of power — without turning into a manipulative jerk. 1. Make clear judgment callsWhen a meeting goes in circles, influential people step in and say, \"We've covered the options. It seems like we're leaning toward X, so we'll get started on that. Sound good?\" This is role power in action, using your authority to make decisions within your domain. Most people shy away from role power because they don't want to appear controlling. But when everything is a committee decision, it creates more confusion. Try this: The next time someone raises an issue, don't let it bounce around like a hot potato. Take charge and assign ownership, \"I'll coordinate with legal. Gerald, can you drive the marketing piece?\" 2. Generously recognize others Influential people don't hoard credit. They spread appreciation around early and often. This builds reward power, or your ability to give people something they want. When you make others feel seen, they go out of their way to help you succeed.Try this: Each week, shout out a team member via email or team chat, or during a meeting. Don't just say \"the team did a good job,\" personalize your praise and be specific. For example, \"Pooja's idea saved us 10 hours of developer time!\" or, \"Big shout out to Rafael for his analysis, which flagged this risk.\"3. Project competence without cockiness   You can be the smartest person in the room. But your knowledge means nothing if no one seeks out your input or respects your opinion enough to act on it. That's the difference between expertise and expert power. Expertise is measured by your skill level, whereas expert power is about whether people trust your insight.Try this: Lead with \"what if\" and \"I wonder\" statements followed by your experience to avoid coming off as a know-it-all. For example, \"What if we tried adjusting the price? I've seen that work with similar products in the past,\" or, \"I wonder whether we've accounted for processing time since that's added a two-week delay before.\"4. Hold others accountable Even the nicest people have to enforce limits. When someone misses deadlines or violates the rules, influential people address it calmly and directly by using coercive power. This ability to punish people is the form of power you want to use the least, but sometimes it's necessary to uphold standards and keep the culture safe. You can use this even without formal authority, as long as you're in a situation where you're responsible for an outcome, like running a meeting or leading a particular project. Context matters, though. You can hold peers accountable for being disruptive, but you'll need to tread more carefully with a superior.Try this: Name the pattern, state the impact, and set an expectation. This can sound like, \"I noticed you talked over Carol twice yesterday. When people get cut off, they stop speaking up. Going forward, please let people finish their thoughts before jumping in.\" 5. Pay attention to personal details What if you could gain power just from being who you are? This is referent power, which comes from people wanting to be associated with you because of your character and values. Influential people don't treat relationships transactionally. When you make people feel seen and valued, they're more likely to trust you, support your ideas, and want to work with you. Try this: When someone shares something personal, make a reminder and follow up on it. It takes 30 seconds to ask \"How was your daughter's recital?\" or \"Did the kitchen renovation go well?\" But it creates deep rapport. The best part is that these behaviors compound. The more you use them, the more natural they become, and the more influence you build without even trying. Melody Wilding, LMSW is an executive coach, human behavior professor, and author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.\" Get her free training, 5 Steps to Speak Like a Senior Leader, here. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen attends a press conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 28, 2025. Nadja Wohlleben | ReutersDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned President Donald Trump to stop threatening to acquire Greenland just a day after the U.S. carried out a military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. \"The Kingdom of Denmark — and thus Greenland — is part of NATO and is therefore covered by the alliance's security guarantee. We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland,\" Frederiksen said Sunday, in a statement. \"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" she said. The warning from Frederiksen comes after Trump was quoted by The Atlantic magazine, saying, \"We do need Greenland, absolutely.\"Trump ordered a military operation over the weekend that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. The pair has been brought to the U.S. on drug-related charges. The operation came after months of U.S. military buildup and threats against Venezuela, which the Trump administration claims is complicit in trafficking drugs to the U.S. The move to topple Maduro led to speculation that Trump's other territorial ambitions could be obtained by force. Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, posted to X a map of Greenland covered with an American flag with the caption \"SOON,\" shortly after Maduro was captured. Trump has long mused about acquiring Greenland, the mineral-rich and self-governing territory of Denmark. Last month, he appointed Louisiana's GOP Gov. Jeff Landry special envoy to Greenland. Trump has also openly spoken about making Canada, an independent nation, the 51st state of the U.S.Greenland and Canada have both repeatedly rebuked Trump's advances.  ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Trump administration is facing renewed questions over its recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and charged him with crimes related to drug trafficking.  Hernandez in 2024 was convicted of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Hernandez in November, saying in a post to his Truth Social account that he had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, along with four other charges: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday was pressed on the apparent contradiction of Hernandez' pardon now that the U.S. is seeking similar charges against Maduro, another head of state of a South American nation with ties to the drug trade. \"I don't do the pardon file, I'm not against it or for it, I didn't review the file, so I can't speak to you about the dynamics that led the president to make the decision that he made,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He reviewed the file, he went through the arguments in it and he felt that the former president of Honduras was treated very unfairly by the previous administration,\" Rubio said. Rubio said that \"whether you agree with that decision or not ... that doesn't mean you leave Maduro in place.\"\"The answer to that, whether you have a problem with it or not, is not to leave in play someone who has been indicted who hasn't even faced American justice yet,\" Rubio said. Trump's pardon of Hernandez was already under intense scrutiny before Maduro's ouster. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the \"hypocrisy underlying this decision is especially glaring.\"\"This same president recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, including conspiring with narcotics traffickers while in office,\" Warner said. \"Yet now, the administration claims that similar allegations justify the use of military force against another sovereign nation. You cannot credibly argue that drug trafficking charges demand invasion in one case, while issuing a pardon in another.\"At a press conference on Saturday after Maduro's capture, Trump was pressed on the pardon. He said Hernandez was \"persecuted very unfairly.\" \"He was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,\" Trump said, referring to his own criminal prosecutions for allegedly hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election after leaving office following his first term as president. Trump also cited his endorsement of Nasry Asfura, the president-elect of Honduras, as another reason for the pardon. \"He's also a party member of the man who won, so obviously the people liked what I did,\" Trump said. \"And one of the reasons that was done is because of the fact that the party in power felt very strongly that that man was treated very badly.\"Trump also gestured at Rubio and other members of his national security team when explaining why he issued the pardon. \"I went to a lot of the people standing behind me, and they felt that that man was persecuted and treated very badly,\" he said.

Jesus Vargas | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his wife and four other people with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday morning after the couple's dramatic capture by American forces in their own country.\"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment alleges.The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

    "body": "Amazon Ireland corporate offices in Dublin, as Amazon.com, Inc., said on Tuesday it plans to cut its global corporate workforce by as many as 14,000 roles and seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI), in Dublin, Ireland, Oct. 28, 2025. Damien Eagers | ReutersValuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending.Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonThis week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\"Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a price forecast of $300. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240.The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending.Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with Alphabet-owned Google expanding more gradually, and Meta Platforms lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage.Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%. See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.MicrosoftLet's look at another tech giant, Microsoft (MSFT). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $650. The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562.\"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss.Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises.Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead.Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market.Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See Microsoft Technology Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Micron TechnologyMemory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers.Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a price target of $300. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285.Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\"Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25.The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate.Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%. See Micron Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump stands behind him during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday appeared to backtrack on President Donald Trump's claim that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela after U.S. forces on Saturday captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and hauled him to the U.S. Asked for details on how the U.S. plans to run Venezuela, Rubio said the U.S. would use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims. He did not say the U.S. would directly govern Venezuela.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean. \"What's going to happen here is we have a quarantine on their oil, that means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" \"That leverage remains, that leverage is ongoing and we expect that it's going to lead to results here,\" Rubio said. Pressed by the host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Kristen Welker, on who is running Venezuela, Rubio was more direct. \"Well, it's not running,\" Rubio said. \"It's running policy, the policy with regard to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.\"Trump said on Saturday said the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" The comments sparked a firestorm of criticism from Trump's adversaries and some allies, who warned against a nation-building exercise in Venezuela. \"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and dollars,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on ABC on Sunday. Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president following Maduro's capture. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in New York on Saturday night to face charges related to drug trafficking. Rubio's comments suggest that the U.S. will take a softer approach with Venezuela than Trump's initial suggestions of ruling the country with a \"group.\" Though Rubio said Trump still may take further military action to achieve U.S. goals. Asked on \"Meet the Press\" about further military action in Venezuela, Rubio said Trump \"retains all his optionality.\"Rubio also extrapolated on the U.S.' aims with Venezuela's oil reserves. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. is \"going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure.\"Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. \"Ultimately, this is not about securing the oil fields; this is about ensuring that no sanctioned oil can come in and out until they make changes to the governance of that entire industry,\" Rubio said on ABC. \"The way to address it to the benefit of the Venezuelan people is to get private companies that are not from Iran or somewhere else to go in and invest in the equipment.\" Rubio said he has not spoken to specific U.S. oil companies about the prospect of starting business in Venezuela. Currently, only Chevron operates in the country. \"We're pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest from Western companies,\" Rubio said. Rubio said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be \"taking an assessment and speaking to some of these companies.\"Clarification: The U.S. military captured Nicolas Maduro and removed him from Venezuela. That was not clear in a reference in an earlier version of this article.",

    "body": "The oil tanker \"Minerva Astra\" lies at anchor in Maracaibo, Venezuela, as protester with the Venezuelan flag approaches the vessel Dec. 17, 2002.Andrew Alvarez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe arrest of Nicolás Maduro has thrown one of the world's most politically fraught oil industries back into focus, forcing investors to reassess who controls Venezuela's crude resources and whether they can be meaningfully revived after decades of decline.For now, the answer may seem straightforward. \"Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-owned oil company, controls the majority of the oil production and reserves,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. American energy corporation Chevron operates in the country through its own production and a joint venture with PDVSA, while Russian and Chinese firms also participate through partnerships, though \"majority control is still with PDVSA,\" Lipow said. If Trump is successful in seeing a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government take shape in Venezuela, Chevron is best placed [to control Venezuelan oil] given the are already well positioned there.Saul KavonicMST FinancialVenezuela nationalized its oil industry in the 1970s, which led to the creation of PDVSA. Oil output peaked at about 3.5 million barrels per day in 1997, but has since plunged to an estimated 950,000 barrels per day, with around 550,000 barrels per day exported, data provided by Lipow Oil Associates showed.If a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government takes shape in Venezuela, Chevron would be \"best placed\" to expand its role, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial. European companies like Repsol and Eni could also benefit, given their existing positions in Venezuela, he said.What it means for global oilAny regime change could disrupt the commercial chain that keeps Venezuelan barrels flowing, industry experts warned.\"Since it is unclear at this time who is in charge in Venezuela, we might see exports completely halt as the buyers don't know to whom to send the money,\" said Lipow. He added that the latest round of U.S. sanctions on a shadow fleet of tankers has severely affected exports, forcing Venezuela to cut production.The shadow fleet refers to tankers that operate outside traditional shipping, insurance and regulatory systems to move crude from sanctioned countries. These vessels are commonly used to transport oil from nations such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, which face U.S. restrictions on energy exports.Lipow expects Chevron to continue exporting 150,000 barrels per day, limiting any immediate supply impact. Still, he said the broader uncertainty could add a short-term risk premium of about $3 per barrel.That bump would come against a market that many analysts see as adequately supplied, at least for now. \"The oil market currently is trending towards oversupply,\" Rapidan Energy Group's Bob McNally said, calling the immediate impact \"almost a nothing burger.\" Venezuela's longer-term importance lies in the type of oil it produces. The country's heavy, sour crude can be technically challenging to extract, but prized by complex refineries, particularly in the U.S. \"American refineries... love to slurp that gunky oil from Venezuela and Canada,\" McNally said.\"The real issues are, will the oil industry be able to get back into Venezuela and reverse two decades of dilapidation and neglect and get it back up?\"If a new government led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is installed very quickly, sanctions could ease and oil exports could initially rise as stored oil is used to generate revenue, Lipow said. However, a short-term surge could pressure prices, he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past one yearStill, any notion of a sustained recovery faces hard physical limits. \"The Venezuelan oil industry is in such a state of disrepair that even with a change in government, it is unlikely to see any material increase in oil production for years as substantial investments are required to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure,\" he noted.Similarly, RBC's Helima Croft warned that the path to recovery is long, citing Venezuela's \"decades-long decline under the Chávez and Maduro regimes.\" She said that oil executives contend it will cost at least $10 billion annually to turn the sector around, with \"a stable security environment\" an absolute prerequisite.\"All bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,\" she said.— CNBC's Chery Kang and Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "SpaceX headquarters is shown in Hawthorne, California, U.S. June 5, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersElon Musk's Starlink is offering free broadband internet service to users in Venezuela through Feb. 3, following U.S. airstrikes and the capture of ousted leader Nicolas Maduro. The satellite internet provider said in a release on Sunday that service credits were being added proactively to both active and inactive accounts as it monitored evolving conditions and regulatory requirements. \"While we do [not yet have] a timeline for local purchase availability, if and when there are updates they will be communicated directly through official Starlink channels,\" it added. Starlink, which is a subsidiary of aerospace company SpaceX, provides internet access through low-earth-orbit satellites and requires users to purchase separate equipment to connect to the service.Starlink's availability map on its website lists Venezuela as \"coming soon,\" suggesting the company had not formally launched service there, despite indicating that some users were already active.A ramp-up of free internet services in the country could help provide connectivity amid the fallout of recent U.S. airstrikes and a ground raid to capture and extradite Maduro for trial on allegations including narco-terrorism and election rigging. Washington's operations on Jan. 3 mostly targeted areas in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, with the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira also attacked, according to a government statement.Following the airstrikes, reports indicated that areas of Caracas had lost power and internet connectivity. Some local outlets also reported outages in Miranda over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that the U.S. would oversee Venezuela's transition, though details remain unclear amid concerns over a power vacuum.The president also announced Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in after Maduro's arrest, but has threatened a second strike on Venezuela if the leadership didn't \"behave.\"Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council plans to hold a meeting on Jan. 6 to discuss the legality of U.S. action, as countries, including U.S. allies such as Brazil and Spain, have condemned the military actions.  Venezuela is far from the first conflict zone in which Starlink has been deployed. In a similar case in Ukraine, the satellite service was rolled out to replace internet and communication networks damaged by Russia's invasion. While Starlink had initially provided internet services in Ukraine largely at its own expense, its operations have been funded under a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense since June 2023. Starlink did not disclose how many users it has in Venezuela or the cost of providing the service.

The legislation aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population through a series of reforms, including by establishing a \"a risk and needs assessment system\" that gives some inmates the chance of early release into home confinement.It is unclear whether Trump or the White House had any direct involvement in Lichtenstein or Morgan securing an early prison release. But the announcements from the bitcoin hacker and his wife follow a number of high-profile cybercrime-related pardons and commutations that have been doled out by the crypto friendly president since his return to office.One day after his inauguration, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.In October, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of major crypto exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.",

    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications. Read moreTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersEurope's largest lender HSBC on Wednesday reported annual pre-tax profit of $29.91 billion, beating the estimates on the back of a strong performance in its wealth division and Hong Kong businesses.While annual profit declines 7.4%, HSBC's revenue gained 4%, year on year.Here are HSBC's full-year results compared with the consensus estimates compiled by the bank.Pre-tax profit: $29.91 billion vs. $28.86 billionRevenue: $68.27 billion vs. $67.36 billionThe lender's fourth quarter profit before tax rose to $6.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from a year earlier, largely due to favorable one-off items linked to business disposals. Operating expenses rose 8% to $9.3 billion, reflecting restructuring costs, technology investment and higher performance-related pay.Its revenue for the final quarter jumped 42% year on year to $16.4 billion. HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery said 2025 marked a year of \"decisive action and swift execution,\" with all four of the bank's businesses performing well and building strong momentum.The lender now aims to deliver a return on average tangible equity — a measure of profitability — of 17% or more, excluding notable items, in between 2026 and 2028.The results come close on the heels of HSBC completing the privatization of Hang Seng Bank on Jan. 26, with the latter's shares subsequently delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. HSBC said last year that the deal would be add to its earnings and was a better use of capital than buybacks.\"We do anticipate revenue and cost synergies between the two brands, but we expect that to come through gradually in the medium term,\" Morningstar's equity analyst Kathy Chan said.The take private offer was \"an exciting opportunity to grow both Hang Seng and HSBC,\" Elhedery said last October, adding that the bank would preserve Hang Seng's brand while investing to strengthen its capabilities.At the start of the month, Bloomberg reported that HSBC was set to award minimal or no bonuses to some bankers as it moves toward a tougher, more performance-driven compensation model similar to that of its Wall Street peers. The bank intends to use the upcoming bonus round to push out underperformers in areas such as investment banking and wealth management, potentially including managing directors, the report said, citing according to people familiar with the matter. While HSBC has not confirmed any final decisions regarding plans to cull underperformers, Morningstar's Chan said she would not be surprised to see further headcount reductions, given the Group's broader goal to improve operational efficiency and deliver cost savings.Hong Kong listed shares of HSBC declined 0.46%.",

    "body": "watch nowCava, the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported record-breaking revenue for fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday and forecast sales growth for fiscal year 2026.Shares gained roughly 10% in extended trading Tuesday. \"While there are a lot of factors around us that are creating pressures from a margin perspective, our model has allowed us to be very thoughtful and minimize price increases to our guests and to consumers in general, which really helps elevate our value perception,\" CFO Tricia Tolivar told CNBC. Though the company said last quarter that it saw a pullback among younger consumers, Tolivar said that trend came to an end in the final three months of its fiscal year.\"We actually saw firming in that category, and overall [we're] seeing improvement in our trends across income cohorts, age cohorts, different parts of the country,\" Tolivar said. \"And in fact, we believe there's a little bit of a bridge that we've been able to create in this K-shaped economy, where we want to be accessible for everyone, and we're doing our best to ensure that our amazing culinary and incredible hospitality is there for all customers across the country.\"She added that some of Cava's best performing restaurants are in markets where median household incomes are lower.The restaurant chain reported same-store sales up 0.5% in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates of a 1.1% decline, according to StreetAccount. Much of that growth was thanks to menu prices and product mix, and partially offset by a 1.4% decline in foot traffic, the company said. Tolivar said Cava raised prices about 1.7% at the beginning of 2025 and that 2026 would see \"very modest increases.\"The company also recorded 72 net new restaurant openings in fiscal 2025 for a total of 439 locations.Here's how Cava performed in the period ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. 3 cents expectedRevenue: $275 million vs. $268 million expectedIn the fourth quarter, Cava reported net income of $4.9 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to $78.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of $275 million marked an increase of nearly 21% year over year. For the full fiscal year, the company reported record-breaking revenue surpassing $1 billion, a growth of more than 20% compared to the year prior. Same-restaurant sales for the year increased by 4%. \"We believe our momentum reflects more than just expansion,\" CEO Brett Schulman said on a call with analysts. \"It signals that our value proposition is resonating with today's increasingly discerning consumer, and as guests become more intentional with their spend, they are choosing brands like Cava that deliver real differentiation through bold flavors, healthy food and hospitality that creates meaningful human connection.\"For fiscal year 2026, Cava said it expects 74 to 76 net new restaurant openings, in addition to same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. Tolivar said the company is expecting strong results from its upcoming menu additions, including a salmon offering, which will mark Cava's first entry into seafood.",

    "body": "watch nowIran wants to make a \"deal\" more than the U.S., President Donald Trump said Tuesday stateside, ahead of another round of talks with Tehran around its nuclear program and amid a build up of American forces in the Middle East. Tehran's refusal to commit to not developing nuclear weapons remains the key sticking point holding up an agreement, Trump said at a pre-address meeting hours before the State of the Union speech in Washington, D.C, CNBC's Joe Kernen reported. In his State of the Union address late Tuesday, Trump said that \"They [Iran] want to make a deal, but we haven't heard those secret words: We will never have a nuclear weapon.\"The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold talks on Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland, with a focus on Iran's nuclear program. \"My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy,\" Trump said in his address. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he was still working on the proposal and political leadership in Tehran has yet to sign off on it. He said the proposal would consist of elements that accommodate both sides' \"concerns and interests.\" Araghchi added that the proposal will be discussed in Geneva and both sides will work on a text to try and reach \"a fast deal.\" The earlier rounds of negotiations failed to deliver a meaningful breakthrough and tensions continued to run high with Trump threatening limited airstrikes on Iran.  Following the second round of negotiations in Geneva last week, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X on Sunday that the recent talks had \"yielded encouraging signals\" but warned that Iran was prepared for \"any potential scenario.\" Tensions have escalated sharply in recent weeks as Washington builds up its military presence in the region and Trump warning that \"really bad things\" would happen unless Tehran agreed to a deal over the future of its nuclear program. TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump addresses the nation, alongside US Vice President JD Vance (L), US Secretary of State Marco Rubio (2nd R) and US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (R), from the White House in Washington, DC on June 21, 2025. Carlos Barria | Afp | Getty ImagesThe State Department ordered the evacuation of non-emergency personnel at the U.S. embassy in Beirut on Monday amid renewed warnings of airstrikes from Trump. Last Friday, Trump said that he was considering limited airstrikes on Iran while dangling a deadline of two weeks for Tehran to reach a nuclear deal.    Iran has signaled that it was prepared to make concessions on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions and acknowledgement of its right to enrich uranium, Reuters reported citing a senior Iranian official. The official said that Tehran would consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium. But in doing that, it demanded the U.S. to recognize Iran's right for nuclear enrichment and lifting economic sanctions, according to Reuters.  Oil prices edged higher, extending gains amid concerns of an impending military action against Iran in the absence of a deal. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 45 cents, or 0.66% to $66 a barrel, while Brent futures gained 47 cents, or 0.66%, to $71.2.Further escalation could push prices for the U.S. crude beyond $70 and potentially toward $80 per barrel, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank, while noting that \"geopolitically driven rallies\" tend to prove temporary and any sharp upside move may give way to a correction.

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, attends the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., in New York, Oct. 21, 2025.Eduardo Munoz | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is taking steps to address the impact of artificial intelligence on its workers, and part of what he said should be a broader societal response to the potentially disruptive nature of AI.Dimon described at an investor meeting late Monday his bank's internal plans to shift employees into new roles as automation accelerates.\"We already have huge redeployment plans for [our] own people,\" Dimon said. \"In fact, we spoke about it today, and we have to up that a little bit so we can take people who are displaced — and we have displaced people from AI — and we offer them other jobs.\"JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank by market cap, has the industry's largest annual tech budget at nearly $20 billion. Its executives have outlined an ambitious agenda to become \"fundamentally rewired\" for the AI era.Even at this early stage, the bank's workforce provides a snapshot of what happens when corporations employ AI technology, including models from OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both used by JPMorgan's AI portal.The bank's head count was roughly unchanged at 318,512 over the past year, but there were changes below the surface: Operations and support staff fell by 4% and 2%, respectively, as the firm added 4% to roles that involve catering to clients and generating revenue.It did that by using technology to boost the number of accounts that each operations employee can handle (up 6%), reducing the per-unit cost to deal with fraud (down 11%) and making their software engineers 10% more efficient, according to the bank's presentation.  JPMorgan has doubled the use cases for generative AI this year, focusing on customer service and the firm's technology workers, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said at the investor meeting.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Dimon's comments about plans for redeployment. Disruption risk When an analyst on Monday asked if Dimon was concerned about the risk of widespread unemployment because of AI — one of several fears circulating as every AI model update seemed to wallop the shares of public companies in recent weeks — Dimon had this response: \"We are going to deploy AI as best we can to do a better job for our customers.\" The CEO  has previously likened the potential impact of AI to that of electricity or the printing press.Beyond the \"huge redeployment plans\" for his bank, Dimon expressed concern that the rapid adoption of AI could put entire professions out of work.As a thought experiment, what if autonomous trucks were introduced overnight, he asked.\"Would you do it if you put 2 million people on the street?\" Dimon asked. \"That next job is $25,000 a year, stocking shelves.\"Businesses and governments need to begin planning for this risk now, with ideas including assistance and training for displaced workers, he said.\"Society's got to think through what it wants to do if this becomes that kind of problem,\" Dimon said. \"Now is the time to start thinking about it.\"watch now",

DOJ \"also removed some documents from the public database where accusations against Jeffrey Epstein also mention Trump,\" NPR reported.A law signed by Trump in late 2025 requires the DOJ to make public, with few exceptions, all of its investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.Trump is a former friend of Epstein. The two fell out in the early 2000s. The president has never been criminally charged in connection with a claim by an Epstein survivor.Trump last week said the Epstein files had \"totally exonerated\" him.Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., in a statement on Tuesday said, \"For the last few weeks, Oversight Democrats have been investigating the FBI's handling of allegations from 2019 of sexual assault on a minor made against President Donald Trump by a survivor.\"Yesterday, I reviewed unredacted evidence logs at the Department of Justice. Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,\" said Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\"Oversight Democrats will open a parallel investigation into this.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 live updates: Trump speechEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealGarcia also said that because of a prior subpoena issued by the Oversight Committee, as well as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, \"These records must immediately be shared with Congress and the American public.\"\"Covering up direct evidence of a potential assault by the President of the United States is the most serious possible crime in this White House cover up,\" he said.The DOJ, when contacted by CNBC for comment, pointed to a post on X in which it responded to Garcia's statement.\"@OversightDems should stop misleading the public while manufacturing outrage from their radical anti-Trump base,\" the post said. \"@TheJusticeDept has repeatedly said publicly AND directly to @NPR prior to deadline - NOTHING has been deleted. If files are temporarily pulled for victim redactions or to redact Personally Identifiable Information, then those documents are promptly restored online and are publicly available.\"\"ALL responsive documents have been produced unless a document falls within one of the following categories: duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation,\" DOJ said.The White House referred CNBC to the DOJ's X post when asked for comment.Trump was asked by a reporter last week about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, by police in the United Kingdom on suspicion of misconduct in public office. That arrest is believed to be related to an investigation into whether Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, had shared confidential trade reports with Epstein.\"I'm the expert in a way because I've been totally exonerated. That's very nice. I can actually speak about it very nicely,\" Trump said of the arrest.\"I think it's a shame.

    "body": "The Cursor logo arranged on a smartphone in New Hyde Park, New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCursor announced updates to its artificial intelligence coding agents on Tuesday as the startup works to fend off increasingly stiff competition from rivals like Anthropic, OpenAI and Microsoft. The AI startup has to stay on the cutting edge to win new users and market share, and the company told CNBC that its updated agents push its capabilities to the next level. The startup's valuation has ballooned to $29.3 billion, and it said in November that it had crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue. Cursor was relatively early to the AI coding market, but other players have been quick to launch competing offerings.AI agents are tools that can complete tasks on behalf of a user, and they have exploded in popularity over the last year as model capabilities have improved. Some of the earliest adopters have been software developers, who are using agents from companies like Cursor to generate, edit and review code. Cursor's updated agents can test their own changes and record their work through videos, logs and screenshots, the company said. Users can trigger the agents from the web, Cursor's desktop app, on a mobile device, through the messaging platform Slack or on Microsoft's GitHub.The agents can also run in parallel with full development environments on their own virtual machines, which are cloud-based computers that behave just like a physical one. This means agents won't have to compete for resources locally on a developer's laptop or waste time onboarding, Cursor said.\"Instead of having one to three things that you're doing at once that are running at the same time, you can have 10 or 20 of these things running,\" ​​Alexi Robbins, co-head of engineering for asynchronous agents Cursor, told CNBC in an interview. \"You can have really high throughput with this.\"Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo opens robotaxi service to 'select riders' in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and OrlandoMeta strikes AI chip deal with AMD days after committing to deploy millions of Nvidia GPUsUber acquiring parking app SpotHero as it moves beyond ride-hailing and food deliveryTesla sues California DMV to reverse ruling that company engaged in false advertising on FSDAs of February, Anthropic's Claude Code has grown to over $2.5 billion in run-rate revenue, and OpenAI's Codex has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in October that its tool, GitHub Copilot, had more than 26 million users. Cursor was founded in 2022, and it amassed a cult following after launching the initial version of its AI coding product the following year. Developers can hand off more complex tasks to Cursor's updated agents, and those agents can test and iterate on those features until they are complete. Cursor said this will allow developers to spend less time editing files and parsing through code and more time focusing on questions of taste and judgement.\"We think of this less like a new feature and more like, 'This is what it's going to look like working with agents,'\" said Jonas Nelle, Cursor's other co-head of engineering for asynchronous agents. \"They're not just writing software, writing code, they're sort of becoming full software developers.\"Cursor has been testing the agents internally, and Nelle said it has already been a \"big transformation\" for the company. Roughly 35% of Cursor's pull requests, where a developer proposes a change to the codebase, are now generated by agents that are operating on their own virtual machines, Cursor said. \"You as an individual can do so much more by working with these agents,\" Nelle said. \"This is another step change in that progression.\"WATCH: Cursor CEO Michael Truell: We’re seeing success with our AI age, not just demandwatch now",

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 taxis at Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from Boston on September 1, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSpirit Airlines is gearing up to shrink to a tiny version of its former self, focusing on high-demand travel periods and routes as well as expanding premium-class seats in an attempt to survive, according to a new plan it unveiled in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday.Much of the airline's focus will be on flying to destinations from its major Florida airports, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, as well as from the New York area and Detroit, CEO Dave Davis told CNBC.Flights that don't touch those airports \"will be an even smaller part of the network,\" Davis said. He declined to specify which routes could be cut, but noted high competition on cross-country flights, as well as some weakness in demand for visiting friends and relatives, a key segment of air travel, in Latin America. He said some Latin American flying would likely be trimmed but that the region would still be important to Spirit.The airline will also focus more on peak travel days and will cut money-losing flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Davis said.Leaner airlineThe budget travel icon said it will get rid of even more of its Airbus fleet as it plans to exit its second bankruptcy in less than a year. It expects to emerge in late spring or early summer, Spirit's lawyer, Marshall Huebner of Davis Polk, said at a hearing Tuesday. Spirit said the changes will make the airline leaner and more competitive. The company said under the plan it estimates it will have reduced costs and said its debt and lease obligations will be cut from $7.4 billion to $2.1 billion after this bankruptcy.Spirit has reached an agreement in principle with its creditors for the plan, Huebner said, adding that secured lenders will make \"material incremental liquidity available to Spirit via the release of cash collateral.\"Spirit will rework its network and schedules to increase aircraft utilization during high-demand periods and on popular routes and to lower use during travel lulls. The carrier also plans to expand its Spirit First and premium economy, as well as update its loyalty program.Davis told CNBC that the airline is planning to roll out premium economy seating across the fleet and is considering adding a third row of its top-cabin product, the so-called \"Big Front Seat.\"Read moreThe new fleet would be made up of mostly older Airbus planes, \"with the potential rejection of additional high cost NEO aircraft,\" Huebner said, referring to the more modern Airbus A320 family of planes, adding that the exact size of Spirit's fleet will depend on talks with counterparts like aircraft lessors.He said Spirit's annualized fleet cost would be cut another $550 million, down 65% from before its bankruptcy filing last year. The debtors have also eyed another $300 million in cost savings from nonfleet cuts, he said.Spirit has already reduced some of its Airbus fleet and furloughed pilots and flight attendants to cut costs as it reduced its network, though some cabin crew members were called back to work ahead of spring break.Davis acknowledged that attrition has depleted some staffing levels and said it is too early to tell whether the carrier will have to reduce staff to meet its new fleet footprint.In its second bankruptcy, Spirit had held deal talks with Frontier Airlines, and with investment firm Castlelake. Nothing materialized, but Huebner hinted a combination could be back on the table.\"This emergence will allow Spirit to do many things from a position of strength and stability, including to consider potential future industry transactions,\" Huebner said.Davis said that more consolidation among low-cost airlines \"makes sense\" but added that \"if we build a sustainably profitable entity here, we'll have a lot of options in front of us.\"watch nowHow Spirit got hereSpirit's path will be challenging. It would pit a smaller version of Spirit against ever-larger competitors that dominate the U.S. market. Some U.S. budget carriers have struggled due to a surge in labor and other costs post-Covid as well as a growing consumer shift in favor of more upscale travel, among other things.\"Because every single day counts, and every single dollar counts, the airline industry is just as competitive today with this deal in hand as it was last Friday, and we must — and will — lock down what we need from other stakeholders and then begin a high speed march to get this storied company out of Chapter 11 at the earliest possible date so that it can write its next chapters from a position of strength,\" Huebner said. Spirit was uniquely challenged by a massive engine recall from Pratt & Whitney and a failed plan to get acquired by JetBlue Airways, a deal knocked down by a federal judge in early 2024.Spirit forecast it would generate a net profit of $252 million last year, according to a court filing in December 2024. But it said in an August report that it lost nearly $257 million in a matter of months stretching from March 13, after it exited its first Chapter 11 bankruptcy, through the end of June. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again less than a month later.Another challenge for Spirit is that large U.S. airlines like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines have launched their own no-frills basic economy fares that look more like Spirit's model, though they were attached to larger carriers. Davis said Spirit still plays \"an extremely important role\" in the industry, though some competitors have prepared for the airline to shrink, if not cease operations entirely, adding flights on routes Spirit had abandoned.\"The reason fares are low, the reason basic economy fares are low on our legacy competitors, is because airlines like us exist,\" he said. \"If we didn't exist, fares ... would be substantially higher than they are right now, I can guarantee you.\"Read more CNBC airline newsUnited Airlines is overhauling its MileagePlus loyalty program to favor credit cardholdersSpirit Airlines sells more planes, calls back 500 flight attendants from furlough ahead of spring breakFAA abruptly halted El Paso flights over Defense Department’s plans for anti-drone technologyPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsSouthwest ends open seating after 54 years.

David Luan announced his departure Tuesday in a LinkedIn post, saying he will exit at the end of the week \"to cook up something new.\" Amazon tapped Luan in December 2024 to oversee its newly created AGI lab, based in San Francisco. The lab is focused on \"long-term research bets,\" including developing \"useful AI agents.\" Last year, the group released Amazon's Nova Act agent, an extension of its Nova models, which the company hopes will compete with leading AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini.\"There's incredible work to be done at Amazon and opportunities for me to take on more areas,\" Luan wrote. \"But with AGI so close, I decided to spend 100% of my time on teaching AI systems brand new capabilities.\" Luan's departure comes after Amazon announced a major reorganization of its AGI division late last year, bringing it under Peter DeSantis, a 27-year veteran of the company and a senior vice president in its cloud unit. AGI refers to artificial intelligence that can perform as well or better than humans on most tasks.Amazon in June 2024 hired Luan and other top executives from Adept. It also licensed technology from Adept, including some of its AI models and datasets. The deal size was not disclosed.Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson in January said his agency would review these AI acqui-hire deals to learn whether tech companies are attempting to evade regulatory reviews. The agency in 2024 opened a probe into Amazon's hiring of Adept employees. AI acqui-hire deals have also come under scrutiny from lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.Amazon representatives declined to comment. WATCH: AWS CEO Matt Garman on Europe's skepticism of U.S. big tech, the AI capex wave and cloud demandwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said Paramount Skydance had raised its takeover offer to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, in a proposal that could \"reasonably be expected\" to top an existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would reengage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction.\"Later Tuesday, WBD said the amended Paramount offer was for $31 per share, all cash, and included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. Paramount has also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if it were to abandon that deal, as well as a so-called ticking fee tied to delays in getting regulators' approval, WBD said. \"The Board has not made a determination as to whether the revised PSKY proposal is superior to the merger with Netflix,\" it said in a statement. \"WBD will engage further with PSKY to determine if a proposal that constitutes a 'Company Superior Proposal,' as defined in the Netflix Merger Agreement, can be reached.\"If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets at around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.The Warner Bros. Discovery board said Tuesday it continued to advise shareholders not to take action in response to the tender offer. A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

    "body": "A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Lucid Group reported mixed fourth-quarter results Tuesday as the electric vehicle maker continues to face challenging market conditions and internal struggles.The company widely missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, while beating average revenue estimates by roughly 12%. It also revised its 2025 production results due to internal validation issues, but guided for a notable increase in vehicle production this year.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: $3.62 vs. a loss of $2.62 cents expected Revenue: $523 million vs. $468 million expectedLucid's results come days after the company laid off 12% of its U.S. salaried workforce in an effort to streamline operations and \"operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long term growth,\" according to a statement from the company.Interim Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff described the cuts Tuesday to CNBC as a needed realignment of the company's workforce amid broader market and economic concerns as well as needed gains in efficiency. \"We are adjusting and going to a level where we think we want to be and need to be,\" he said. \"But it's nothing that will continue in the future.\"For 2026, the company announced a vehicle production target of between 25,000 and 27,000 units. That would mark an increase of roughly 40% to 51% compared with the year-end figures the company released Tuesday.Lucid said the revision for the year — from 18,378 units to 17,840 units — came as \"538 vehicles had not completed certain internal procedures required under its final validation process to be classified as produced.\"The company said the vehicles are expected to be completed this year, with the change not affecting its previously reported financial results.Winterhoff described the expected growth as \"healthy,\" but not \"outrageous\" given the current slowdown in overall vehicle sales, including EVs.\"Our initial plans were higher, but we wanted to really be conservative and make sure that we are hitting the numbers that we are projecting,\" he told CNBC.watch nowLucid is expected to begin production of a new, less expensive midsize vehicle at the end of this year, but Winterhoff said it will not be material to its 2026 production plans. He said the automaker's Gravity SUV is expected to account for the majority of its production and sales this year, followed by the Air sedan. The company also plans to launch its first Lucid robotaxis with previously announced partners.Winterhoff said the company's main priorities this year are achieving its production target, growing sales, continuing efficiency gains and preparing for production of the midsize vehicle and robotaxis. \"We really want to make sure that we [are] on our path to profitability, make sure that we're not spending money that we don't have to. That's very, very important,\" he told CNBC.Lucid has yet to say when the company expects to be profitable. It is scheduled to host an investor day on March 12 in New York.Lucid said it ended last year with approximately $4.6 billion in total liquidity, which Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said was \"strong\" and would provide flexibility \"to execute near-term objectives while investing in future growth.\"Lucid reported a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2025, in line with a $2.71 billion loss a year earlier. That includes more than doubling its year-over-year losses during the fourth quarter to $814 million. It reported a loss of $12.09 per share for the year. The company's 2025 revenue was up 68% to $1.35 billion, including more than doubling year-over-year results during the fourth quarter.",

    "body": "A wheel loader operator fills a truck with ore at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020. Steve Marcus | ReutersA new race to secure critical minerals is unfolding across the global economy.From Washington's proposed $12 billion Project Vault stockpile to expanding buffers in Asia and the European Union, governments are moving to secure access to metals increasingly viewed as essential to national security and industrial policy.\"In metals and minerals is where the newest wave of stockpiling is most visible,\" said Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at Chatham House. Governments are seeking to reduce exposure to concentrated supply chains and export controls, he said.In the U.S., officials recently outlined a roughly $12 billion strategic mineral reserve dubbed Project Vault. The initiative aims to bolster supply-chain resilience for American industry by building stockpiles of rare earths and other essential metals for electrification, defense and advanced manufacturing.Project Vault complements other initiatives such as the \"Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement (FORGE),\" a partnership to coordinate critical mineral policy pricing and projects, as well as Pax Silica, which centers on safeguarding the AI-related supply chain.There has been a significant shift in the approach to stockpiling strategic commodities in the last year, with a focus on metals in particular.Natalie Scott-GrayStoneXAustralia in January announced plans to formalize a state-backed stockpiling strategy through an $800 million strategic critical minerals reserve, prioritizing antimony, gallium and rare earth elements.The European Union is also advancing plans to build a joint reserve of critical raw materials under its RESourceEU strategy. Italy, France and Germany are expected to lead the effort, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing sources familiar with the matter.As recently as last weekend, India and Brazil agreed to deepen cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths, as New Delhi seeks to diversify supply sources and reduce reliance on China. The pact is aimed at strengthening bilateral trade and building more resilient supply chains for materials critical to clean energy, technology and defense industries.South Korea earlier this year rolled out a comprehensive critical minerals strategy backed by about $172 million in state support. Under this strategy, the government plans to expand stockpile volumes and infrastructure.\"We certainly see a shift to a more resource nationalist mindset amongst many countries,\" said Schröder. \"At this point, it's a slippery slope and strategic stockpiling could become hoarding when measures become coercive, lack transparency and become weaponized.\"'Resource nationalism' in the works?The strategic pivot marks what several analysts describe as a structural shift in commodity policy.\"Metal supply chains are fragile,\" said Ewa Manthey at ING, pointing to years of underinvestment, long timelines for permits, and geographic concentration. In earlier cycles, high prices typically spurred faster mine supply and reduced the need for strategic inventories, she said.\"Today, even with high prices, new supply is slow and uncertain, so inventories themselves are becoming part of the supply strategy,\" Manthey added, characterizing the move to harbor clearly \"nationalist elements.\"Natalie Scott-Gray, senior metals analyst at StoneX, described the trend as \"resource nationalism and catching up time,\" referring to China's long-standing practice of building strategic stockpiles of metals, releasing them when supply is scarce or to cool domestic prices.China dominates rare-earth processing and controls a large share of global refining capacity for industrial metals. Even where reserves are geographically dispersed, processing often remains concentrated.watch nowThe International Energy Agency has repeatedly cautioned that the heavy concentration of critical mineral supply chains poses security vulnerabilities. China's rare-earth export controls announced last year created substantial national and economic security risks worldwide, with potentially serious consequences for key sectors such as energy, autos, defense, aerospace, artificial intelligence and semiconductors, said the agency body.Historically, stockpiles were largely emergency buffers against temporary disruptions or price spikes, said industry watchers. Today's initiatives are more explicitly driven by a need to buffer against geopolitical factors, Schröder said, reflecting a broader shift in how resource security is framed as industrial strategy and national security, rather than just crisis management.\"This commodities stock building cycle is different from past episodes,\" Anushree Ganeriwala, global analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said.\"Previous commodity cycles were largely driven by traditional supply-demand imbalances or weather shocks. What is different now is that policy and geopolitical risks are shaping market outcomes directly.\"Goldman Sachs in February characterized the recent surge in commodity demand for gold and industrial metals as \"insurance-type demand.\"Analysts expect government stockpiling to accelerate, particularly for energy-transition and defense-related metals.\"We are still in the early stages of it,\" Scott-Gray said. \"Governments now treat supply chains as national security infrastructure, not purely commercial flows.\"",

    "body": "United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth speaks during a visit to Sierra Space in Louisville, Colorado on Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. Aaron Ontiveroz | Denver Post | Getty ImagesDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has told Anthropic it has until Friday evening to give the military broad access to its artificial intelligence models, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday. If Anthropic fails to comply, Hegseth threatened to label the company a \"supply chain risk\" or invoke the Defense Production Act, according to sources familiar with the discussion, who asked not to be named because the matter was private. Anthropic's negotiations with the Department of Defense have stalled because it wants assurance that its models will not be used for autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans. The DoD, meanwhile, wants the company to agree to \"all lawful use cases\" without limitation. A \"supply chain risk\" is a designation that's typically reserved for foreign adversaries, but it would require the DoD's vendors and contractors to certify that they do not use Anthropic's models. The Defense Production Act allows the president to control domestic industries under emergency authority when it's in the interest of national security.Hegseth set the deadline during a meeting with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on Tuesday morning, the people said.\"We continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government's national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo opens robotaxi service to 'select riders' in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and OrlandoMeta strikes AI chip deal with AMD days after committing to deploy millions of Nvidia GPUsUber acquiring parking app SpotHero as it moves beyond ride-hailing and food deliveryTesla sues California DMV to reverse ruling that company engaged in false advertising on FSDAnthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. The company was awarded a $200 million contract with the DoD last year.Until this week, Anthropic was the only AI company cleared to deploy its models on the agency's classified networks. Elon Musk's xAI is now the second, as the company recently agreed to allow its models to be deployed in classified settings, according to a senior Pentagon official. The White House's relationship with Anthropic has been rocky since President Donald Trump returned to office, and officials have not been afraid to publicly criticize the company. David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, has accused Anthropic of supporting \"woke AI\" because of its stance on regulation.Losing its contract with the DoD would be a blow to Anthropic, but the company has a number of other large enterprise customers. Anthropic said earlier this month that it has more than 500 customers that spend more than $1 million on an annual basis. The company also just got an infusion of fresh capital, as it closed a $30 billion funding round at a $380 billion valuation this month. WATCH: Defense Sec.

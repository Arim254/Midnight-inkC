    "body": "A steak sandwich and French onion soup from Panera Bread Co. arranged in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023. Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPanera Bread is entering the so-called value wars with its new \"Mix & Match\" deals in a bid to win back price-conscious diners.The chain, known for its soups, salads and sandwiches, is in the early stages of a turnaround, with a focus on reinvesting in its business and reversing years of traffic declines. Once the top fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has fallen to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. In 2024, Panera's sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. A key part of Panera's comeback strategy is focusing on value. Across the restaurant industry, executives have reported weaker spending among consumers, who are trying to save money by trading down to fast food or dining out less frequently. Chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell have leaned into value offerings to try to win back customers. About 3 out of every 4 diners said that daily specials, discounts or value promotions matter when choosing where to dine or order takeout, according to the National Restaurant Association's annual State of the Restaurant Industry report.\"[Consumers] are seeking value, and they're also seeking quality,\" Panera CEO Paul Carbone told CNBC. \"That's so, so important.\"Starting Wednesday, Panera customers can choose halved portions of sandwiches and salads, as well as cups of soup, from the \"Mix & Match\" menu. Each of the 10 items is priced at $4.99, and diners have to buy at least two items. Seasonal menu items will also rotate through the \"Mix & Match\" options. Each order also comes with the choice of a baguette, chips or an apple.Panera explored other value offerings, but the \"Mix & Match\" menu tested successfully, Carbone said. \"The guest has really, really reacted well to it,\" he said, adding the menu is expected to drive incremental visits to the restaurant.And while Panera is introducing the deal, its popular \"You Pick Two\" offering is sticking around. Carbone said that customer research showed that diners view the option to buy two entrees from the menu as an opportunity for variety, rather than a chance to save money. Like \"Mix & Match,\" the offer allows customers to choose a half salad, half sandwich or cup of soup or mac and cheese. However, \"You Pick Two\" spans the menu, rather than being restricted to just 10 items.",

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersEurope's largest lender HSBC on Wednesday reported annual pre-tax profit of $29.91 billion, beating analysts' estimates on the back of a strong performance in its wealth division and Hong Kong businesses.While annual profit declined 7.4%, HSBC's revenue gained 4%, year on year, and both exceeded estimates.Here are HSBC's full-year results compared with the consensus estimates compiled by the bank.Pre-tax profit: $29.91 billion vs. $28.86 billionRevenue: $68.27 billion vs. $67.36 billionThe lender's fourth-quarter profit before tax rose to $6.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from a year earlier, largely due to favorable one-off items linked to business disposals. Operating expenses rose 8% to $9.3 billion, reflecting restructuring costs, technology investment and higher performance-related pay.Its revenue for the final quarter jumped 42% year on year to $16.4 billion. HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery said in a statement that 2025 marked a year of \"decisive action and swift execution,\" with all four of the bank's businesses performing well and building strong momentum.The lender now aims to deliver a return on average tangible equity — a measure of profitability — of 17% or more, excluding notable items, in between 2026 and 2028. RoTE was 13.3% in 2025.The results come close on the heels of HSBC completing the privatization of Hang Seng Bank on Jan. 26, with the latter's shares subsequently delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. HSBC said last year that the deal would be add to its earnings and was a better use of capital than buybacks.\"We do anticipate revenue and cost synergies between the two brands, but we expect that to come through gradually in the medium term,\" Morningstar's equity analyst Kathy Chan said.The take private offer was \"an exciting opportunity to grow both Hang Seng and HSBC,\" Elhedery said last October, adding that the bank would preserve Hang Seng's brand while investing to strengthen its capabilities.Addressing questions on potential job cuts, Elhedery told CNBC's Emily Tan that HSBC was targeting about 8% reduction in payroll costs, but stressed the bank had not not set specific headcount reduction targets. He said the focus was on simplifying the group at scale and removing duplicate roles, pointing to a net 15% reduction in managing director positions through de-duplication.At the start of the month, Bloomberg reported that HSBC was set to award minimal or no bonuses to some bankers as it moves toward a tougher, more performance-driven compensation model similar to that of its Wall Street peers. The bank intends to use the upcoming bonus round to push out underperformers in areas such as investment banking and wealth management, potentially including managing directors, the report said, citing according to people familiar with the matter. While HSBC has not confirmed any final decisions regarding plans to cull underperformers, Morningstar's Chan said she would not be surprised to see further headcount reductions, given the Group's broader goal to improve operational efficiency and deliver cost savings.Hong Kong listed shares of HSBC declined 0.46%.—CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Amazon logo on brick office building facade with windows, San Francisco, California, Aug. 29, 2025.Smith Collection | Gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe head of Amazon's artificial general intelligence lab is leaving the company less than two years after joining through a so-called acqui-hire deal of his startup Adept. David Luan announced his departure Tuesday in a LinkedIn post, saying he will exit at the end of the week \"to cook up something new.\" Amazon tapped Luan in December 2024 to oversee its newly created AGI lab, based in San Francisco. The lab is focused on \"long-term research bets,\" including developing \"useful AI agents.\" Last year, the group released Amazon's Nova Act agent, an extension of its Nova models, which the company hopes will compete with leading AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini.\"There's incredible work to be done at Amazon and opportunities for me to take on more areas,\" Luan wrote. \"But with AGI so close, I decided to spend 100% of my time on teaching AI systems brand new capabilities.\" Luan's departure comes after Amazon announced a major reorganization of its AGI division late last year, bringing it under Peter DeSantis, a 27-year veteran of the company and a senior vice president in its cloud unit. AGI refers to artificial intelligence that can perform as well or better than humans on most tasks.Amazon in June 2024 hired Luan and other top executives from Adept. It also licensed technology from Adept, including some of its AI models and datasets. The deal size was not disclosed.Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson in January said his agency would review these AI acqui-hire deals to learn whether tech companies are attempting to evade regulatory reviews. The agency in 2024 opened a probe into Amazon's hiring of Adept employees. AI acqui-hire deals have also come under scrutiny from lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.Amazon representatives declined to comment. WATCH: AWS CEO Matt Garman on Europe's skepticism of U.S. big tech, the AI capex wave and cloud demandwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowCava, the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported record-breaking revenue for fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday and forecast sales growth for fiscal year 2026.Shares gained roughly 10% in extended trading Tuesday. \"While there are a lot of factors around us that are creating pressures from a margin perspective, our model has allowed us to be very thoughtful and minimize price increases to our guests and to consumers in general, which really helps elevate our value perception,\" CFO Tricia Tolivar told CNBC. Though the company said last quarter that it saw a pullback among younger consumers, Tolivar said that trend came to an end in the final three months of its fiscal year.\"We actually saw firming in that category, and overall [we're] seeing improvement in our trends across income cohorts, age cohorts, different parts of the country,\" Tolivar said. \"And in fact, we believe there's a little bit of a bridge that we've been able to create in this K-shaped economy, where we want to be accessible for everyone, and we're doing our best to ensure that our amazing culinary and incredible hospitality is there for all customers across the country.\"She added that some of Cava's best performing restaurants are in markets where median household incomes are lower.The restaurant chain reported same-store sales up 0.5% in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates of a 1.1% decline, according to StreetAccount. Much of that growth was thanks to menu prices and product mix, and partially offset by a 1.4% decline in foot traffic, the company said. Tolivar said Cava raised prices about 1.7% at the beginning of 2025 and that 2026 would see \"very modest increases.\"The company also recorded 72 net new restaurant openings in fiscal 2025 for a total of 439 locations.Here's how Cava performed in the period ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. 3 cents expectedRevenue: $275 million vs. $268 million expectedIn the fourth quarter, Cava reported net income of $4.9 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to $78.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of $275 million marked an increase of nearly 21% year over year. For the full fiscal year, the company reported record-breaking revenue surpassing $1 billion, a growth of more than 20% compared to the year prior. Same-restaurant sales for the year increased by 4%. \"We believe our momentum reflects more than just expansion,\" CEO Brett Schulman said on a call with analysts. \"It signals that our value proposition is resonating with today's increasingly discerning consumer, and as guests become more intentional with their spend, they are choosing brands like Cava that deliver real differentiation through bold flavors, healthy food and hospitality that creates meaningful human connection.\"For fiscal year 2026, Cava said it expects 74 to 76 net new restaurant openings, in addition to same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. Tolivar said the company is expecting strong results from its upcoming menu additions, including a salmon offering, which will mark Cava's first entry into seafood.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, attends the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., in New York, Oct. 21, 2025.Eduardo Munoz | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is taking steps to address the impact of artificial intelligence on its workers, and part of what he said should be a broader societal response to the potentially disruptive nature of AI.Dimon described at an investor meeting late Monday his bank's internal plans to shift employees into new roles as automation accelerates.\"We already have huge redeployment plans for [our] own people,\" Dimon said. \"In fact, we spoke about it today, and we have to up that a little bit so we can take people who are displaced — and we have displaced people from AI — and we offer them other jobs.\"JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank by market cap, has the industry's largest annual tech budget at nearly $20 billion. Its executives have outlined an ambitious agenda to become \"fundamentally rewired\" for the AI era.Even at this early stage, the bank's workforce provides a snapshot of what happens when corporations employ AI technology, including models from OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both used by JPMorgan's AI portal.The bank's head count was roughly unchanged at 318,512 over the past year, but there were changes below the surface: Operations and support staff fell by 4% and 2%, respectively, as the firm added 4% to roles that involve catering to clients and generating revenue.It did that by using technology to boost the number of accounts that each operations employee can handle (up 6%), reducing the per-unit cost to deal with fraud (down 11%) and making their software engineers 10% more efficient, according to the bank's presentation.  JPMorgan has doubled the use cases for generative AI this year, focusing on customer service and the firm's technology workers, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said at the investor meeting.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Dimon's comments about plans for redeployment. Disruption risk When an analyst on Monday asked if Dimon was concerned about the risk of widespread unemployment because of AI — one of several fears circulating as every AI model update seemed to wallop the shares of public companies in recent weeks — Dimon had this response: \"We are going to deploy AI as best we can to do a better job for our customers.\" The CEO  has previously likened the potential impact of AI to that of electricity or the printing press.Beyond the \"huge redeployment plans\" for his bank, Dimon expressed concern that the rapid adoption of AI could put entire professions out of work.As a thought experiment, what if autonomous trucks were introduced overnight, he asked.\"Would you do it if you put 2 million people on the street?\" Dimon asked. \"That next job is $25,000 a year, stocking shelves.\"Businesses and governments need to begin planning for this risk now, with ideas including assistance and training for displaced workers, he said.\"Society's got to think through what it wants to do if this becomes that kind of problem,\" Dimon said. \"Now is the time to start thinking about it.\"watch now",

    "body": "A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Lucid Group reported mixed fourth-quarter results Tuesday as the electric vehicle maker continues to face challenging market conditions and internal struggles.The company widely missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, while beating average revenue estimates by roughly 12%. It also revised its 2025 production results due to internal validation issues, but guided for a notable increase in vehicle production this year.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: $3.62 vs. a loss of $2.62 cents expected Revenue: $523 million vs. $468 million expectedLucid's results come days after the company laid off 12% of its U.S. salaried workforce in an effort to streamline operations and \"operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long term growth,\" according to a statement from the company.Interim Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff described the cuts Tuesday to CNBC as a needed realignment of the company's workforce amid broader market and economic concerns as well as needed gains in efficiency. \"We are adjusting and going to a level where we think we want to be and need to be,\" he said. \"But it's nothing that will continue in the future.\"For 2026, the company announced a vehicle production target of between 25,000 and 27,000 units. That would mark an increase of roughly 40% to 51% compared with the year-end figures the company released Tuesday.Lucid said the revision for the year — from 18,378 units to 17,840 units — came as \"538 vehicles had not completed certain internal procedures required under its final validation process to be classified as produced.\"The company said the vehicles are expected to be completed this year, with the change not affecting its previously reported financial results.Winterhoff described the expected growth as \"healthy,\" but not \"outrageous\" given the current slowdown in overall vehicle sales, including EVs.\"Our initial plans were higher, but we wanted to really be conservative and make sure that we are hitting the numbers that we are projecting,\" he told CNBC.watch nowLucid is expected to begin production of a new, less expensive midsize vehicle at the end of this year, but Winterhoff said it will not be material to its 2026 production plans. He said the automaker's Gravity SUV is expected to account for the majority of its production and sales this year, followed by the Air sedan. The company also plans to launch its first Lucid robotaxis with previously announced partners.Winterhoff said the company's main priorities this year are achieving its production target, growing sales, continuing efficiency gains and preparing for production of the midsize vehicle and robotaxis. \"We really want to make sure that we [are] on our path to profitability, make sure that we're not spending money that we don't have to. That's very, very important,\" he told CNBC.Lucid has yet to say when the company expects to be profitable. It is scheduled to host an investor day on March 12 in New York.Lucid said it ended last year with approximately $4.6 billion in total liquidity, which Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said was \"strong\" and would provide flexibility \"to execute near-term objectives while investing in future growth.\"Lucid reported a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2025, in line with a $2.71 billion loss a year earlier. That includes more than doubling its year-over-year losses during the fourth quarter to $814 million. It reported a loss of $12.09 per share for the year. The company's 2025 revenue was up 68% to $1.35 billion, including more than doubling year-over-year results during the fourth quarter.",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk was the first company to make a GLP-1 drug for weight loss and became Europe's most valuable company.But its troubles are stacking up and today the stock trades at just a quarter of what it did at its peak less than two years ago.Pricing pressure, fierce competition, and pipeline setbacks have all hit the Danish drugmaker in recent months.Despite being first to launch a GLP-1 drug for weight loss, Novo's market share has eroded, and the company now only captures about 40% of the market, while rival Eli Lilly holds 60%, according to most estimates.Novo is clear-eyed about the challenges it faces, especially around pricing. After the company pre-released its 2026 forecast earlier this month and predicted declining sales, CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC: \"People should expect that it goes down before it comes back up.\"He's repeatedly said that new medicines, the Wegovy pill, and increased volumes will drive long-term growth.These charts show the scale of the challenges Novo is facing. Novo Nordisk is often referred to as a diabetes and obesity pure play. Its portfolio included six branded drugs with annual sales of at least $1 billion in 2025, fewer than comparable current and future rivals.Eli Lilly boasts eight so-called blockbuster drugs, and its portfolio also includes oncology and gene therapies. The combined sales of Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo's two biggest drugs, amounted to about $32 billion, or about 67% of total sales, last year. Combined sales of Lilly's two biggest drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, were about $37 billion, or about 56% of the company's total sales over the same period.Novo also sells insulin, including blockbusters Tresiba and NovoRapid, as well as some drugs for rare diseases like hemophilia, but none come close to bringing in what its GLP-1 drugs do.Among large-cap pharma companies hoping to enter the market for weight loss drugs in the coming years, such as AstraZeneca, Roche, Amgen, and Pfizer, through its acquisition of Metsera, the number of blockbuster drugs was significantly higher. Novo Nordisk has also come under pressure as prices for GLP-1 drugs are coming down in its most important market, the U.S. The U.S. has accounted for more than half of Novo's total sales since 2023, and falling prices there are weighing on both the company's topline and profitability. Last year, Novo and Lilly reached a deal with the Trump administration to lower prices on their GLP-1 drugs on Medicare and Medicaid and offer the treatments directly to consumers at a discount.\"In 2026, Novo Nordisk will face pricing headwinds in an increasingly competitive market,\" said CEO Mike Doustdar, as the company's full-year earnings report was published earlier this month. Novo stock is down 75% since peaking at just over 1,000 Danish kroner a share in mid-2024. The stock is up a little over 10% over the last five years. That compares to Eli Lilly's 400% rise and the European blue-chip index Stoxx 600's 55% gain over the same period.Investors were last rattled on Monday when Novo reported disappointing results of a trial pitting its next-generation weight loss drug, CagriSema, against Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, also known as Zepbound, sending the stock down over 16% on the day.\"Confidence in the share is at rock bottom,\" said Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen on Tuesday.Earlier this month, Novo Nordisk said it expected sales and profits to drop by between 5% and 13% in 2026. If that comes to be true, it would be the first time annual sales have declined since 2017, in local currencies.Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect sales to come in about 8% lower in 2026 compared to 2025. Much of that is due to increasing competition from both Eli Lilly and compounding pharmacies that are selling copycat versions of Novo's branded drugs for a lower price.Longer term, other large-cap pharma companies are planning to enter the market, and are pitching investors more differentiated weight loss drugs to be able to secure a slice of the market share for themselves.Novo is hoping CagriSema can beef up future sales, but after the latest trial results, analysts are increasingly doubting its commercial potential.Novo said it is optimistic about the drug, and that further trials would assess its full weight-loss potential.The Wegovy pill is another potential growth driver for Novo and had a strong launch. However, it remains to be seen how it will fare if Lilly launches its rival pill, expected to hit the market in the second quarter, and what effects lower prices might have on volumes.",

    "body": "A Lowe's store in Concord, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLowe's topped Wall Street's quarterly revenue and earnings expectations on Wednesday, as the retailer's quarterly sales grew more than 10% year over year.The home improvement company said it expects total sales for the full current fiscal year to range between $92 billion and $94 billion, which would be a roughly 7% to 9% increase over the prior year. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $12.25 and $12.75 for the full year. Lowe's said it expects comparable sales, a metric that takes out one-time factors, to be approximately flat to up 2%.In a news release, CEO Marvin Ellison said the company's strategy is resonating with its do-it-yourself customers and home professionals, even as higher mortgage rates and slower real estate sales challenge its industry.\"While the housing macro remains pressured, we are focused on directing what is within our control, which includes our ongoing productivity initiatives,\" he said. \"We remain confident that we are well-positioned to take share regardless of the macro environment.\"Shares fell in premarket trading as Lowe's earnings per share projections for the year fell short of analysts' consensus expectations of $12.95, according to LSEG.Here's what Lowe's reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.98 adjusted vs. $1.94 expectedRevenue: $20.58 billion vs. $20.34 billion expectedLowe's net income for the three-month period that ended Jan. 30 dropped to $999 million, or $1.78 per share, from $1.13 billion, or $1.99 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose from $18.55 billion in the year-ago period.Comparable sales for the quarter rose 1.3%, higher than the 0.2% that analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. The company said in a news release that growth was driven by its gains with home professionals, online sales and home services, along with a strong holiday season.Its competitor, Home Depot, on Tuesday beat Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations, but stuck by conservative full-year guidance. Its quarterly results reflected that home improvement demand remains tepid, as U.S. consumers continue to put off big projects because of high borrowing costs and housing prices as well as economic concerns.Like Home Depot, Lowe's has felt pinched by a tougher backdrop for the industry. Both companies have acquired companies that cater to contractors and other professionals, which tend to be a steadier source of business. Last year, Lowe's acquired Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, insulation and other interior building products for large residential and commercial professionals, for about $8.8 billion. It also bought Artisan Design Group, which provides design services and installation of flooring, cabinets and countertops for homebuilders and property managers, for about $1.33 billion.Lowe's has also made its own moves to reach customers who are delaying home purchases, such as launching a third-party marketplace to expand its mix of merchandise, tapping influencers to raise its visibility on social media and reaching out to young families by relaunching its kids' program.As of Tuesday's close, Lowe's shares are up nearly 16% year-to-date, surpassing the S&P 500's roughly 1% gains during the same period. Its stock is up about 15% over the past year, almost matching the S&P 500's approximately 16% gains over that time. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said Paramount Skydance had raised its takeover offer to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, in a proposal that could \"reasonably be expected\" to top an existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would reengage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction.\"Later Tuesday, WBD said the amended Paramount offer was for $31 per share, all cash, and included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. Paramount has also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if it were to abandon that deal, as well as a so-called ticking fee tied to delays in getting regulators' approval, WBD said. \"The Board has not made a determination as to whether the revised PSKY proposal is superior to the merger with Netflix,\" it said in a statement. \"WBD will engage further with PSKY to determine if a proposal that constitutes a 'Company Superior Proposal,' as defined in the Netflix Merger Agreement, can be reached.\"If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets at around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.The Warner Bros. Discovery board said Tuesday it continued to advise shareholders not to take action in response to the tender offer. A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

    "body": "Prospective buyers arrive during an open house at a home in Seattle, Washington, US, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates dropped sharply last week, and while that helped to prolong gains in refinancing, homebuyer demand seemed unimpressed.Total mortgage application volume was essentially flat, rising just 0.4% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.09% from 6.17%, with points decreasing to 0.53 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the lowest level since September 2022. Applications to refinance a home loan increased 4% last week from the week before and were 150% higher than the same week one year ago, when rates were 79 basis points higher. Refinancing has been on a bit of a tear lately, as rates drop. While the comparisons to a year ago are quite large, it is important to take into account that refinancing was quite low at this time last year. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 12% higher year-over-year. While lower mortgage rates are improving affordability, home prices are still slightly higher than they were at this time last year and economic uncertainty is weighing heavily on consumers.

That's up from 13.1% a year ago and the highest January share in records dating back to 2017.Borrowers are also sought more savings in adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are slightly riskier but offer lower rates. \"The ARM share stayed above 8 percent, as ARM rates remained more than 80 basis points below conforming fixed rates,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist in a release. \"This is giving payment-sensitive borrowers or those seeking larger loans, an incentive to choose this product offering.\" ",

    "body": "United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth speaks during a visit to Sierra Space in Louisville, Colorado on Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. Aaron Ontiveroz | Denver Post | Getty ImagesDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has told Anthropic it has until Friday evening to give the military broad access to its artificial intelligence models, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday. If Anthropic fails to comply, Hegseth threatened to label the company a \"supply chain risk\" or invoke the Defense Production Act, according to sources familiar with the discussion, who asked not to be named because the matter was private. Anthropic's negotiations with the Department of Defense have stalled because it wants assurance that its models will not be used for autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans. The DoD, meanwhile, wants the company to agree to \"all lawful use cases\" without limitation. A \"supply chain risk\" is a designation that's typically reserved for foreign adversaries, but it would require the DoD's vendors and contractors to certify that they do not use Anthropic's models. The Defense Production Act allows the president to control domestic industries under emergency authority when it's in the interest of national security.Hegseth set the deadline during a meeting with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on Tuesday morning, the people said.\"We continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government's national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo opens robotaxi service to 'select riders' in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and OrlandoMeta strikes AI chip deal with AMD days after committing to deploy millions of Nvidia GPUsUber acquiring parking app SpotHero as it moves beyond ride-hailing and food deliveryTesla sues California DMV to reverse ruling that company engaged in false advertising on FSDAnthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude.

The iPhone maker last year unveiled plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S., with CEO Tim Cook appearing at the White House with President Donald Trump in August for the announcement of a $100 billion outlay. The company also has said it will purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers. \"As part of our $600B commitment, Mac mini will be produced in the US for the first time later this year!\" Cook wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. \"We're accelerating our progress even further — producing more AI servers and opening an all-new Apple Advanced Manufacturing Center for hands-on training.\"The Mac Mini is Apple's compact, more affordable desktop computer, which start at about $600, according to the company's website.

The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a large chunk of President Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, but uncertainty remains after Trump rebuked the decision. Apple said its 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center in Houston will open its doors later this year. The company said it will provide training in advanced manufacturing techniques to students, supplier employees, and American businesses, teaching them \"the same innovative processes that are used to make Apple products.\"WATCH: How the Supreme Court's tariff ruling could shift Apple's supply chainwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowNow available on your favorite food delivery app: restaurant reservations. The still-simmering reservation wars of the last decade could fully reignite this year, as a shifting tech landscape pits some of the biggest players against each other to capture businesses and users alike. Reservation incumbents, delivery app newcomers and premium credit card partnerships are all ramping up the fight for a shrinking pool of diners. Delivery giant DoorDash announced in June its $1.2 billion acquisition of SevenRooms, a reservation platform focused on direct bookings through a restaurant's own website. Several months earlier, UberEats and Booking Holdings' OpenTable announced a partnership to integrate reservations on Uber's app. And in 2024, American Express, already the owner of Resy, bought Tock, a reservation platform focused on upscale restaurants, for $400 million.\"It's three very large, very ambitious, very well-resourced companies all vying for the same exact piece of real estate, which is high-demand restaurants,\" Resy and Eater founder Ben Leventhal told CNBC.Leventhal still acts as an advisor to Resy, which was bought by AmEx in 2019, although today he focuses on Blackbird Labs, a loyalty program for independent restaurants that he founded in 2022.Bringing restaurants onlineThe reservation wars initially kicked off more than 10 years ago. Leventhal's Resy burst onto the scene in 2014 and won market share, undercutting OpenTable's legacy business, by charging eateries a simple monthly fee. At the time, OpenTable, which was founded in 1998, charged restaurants both a monthly fee and a cover for each diner who booked through the platform. These days, the company still sometimes charges a variable cover fee for seated diners, depending on the establishment.Thomas Barwick | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesDespite Resy's rise and buzzy partnerships with high-profile restaurants, OpenTable still significantly outstrips its rival by restaurant count.Starting this summer, Resy will integrate the 5,000 eateries, bars and wineries that have listed on Tock onto its own platform, bringing its total number of venues to about 25,000. That's still less than half of OpenTable's roughly 60,000 restaurants.But where OpenTable has scale, Resy has a \"cool factor\" and strong positioning in major cities, like New York, where dining out is big business.And each companies' relationships with credit card companies has added a new layer to the war, too. Supercharging the platformsPlatinum American Express cardholders get special access to restaurant reservations at sought-after establishments, plus a $400 dining credit per year to use at Resy restaurants. \"We know that American Express card members spend close to $90 billion a year ... on dining, and it's a passion area for them,\" Resy CEO Pablo Rivero told CNBC. \"And we know that they also spend more. People with a Resy credit on an American Express card spend over 25% more on dining transactions.\"Likewise, eligible Visa and Chase cardholders get exclusive OpenTable reservations. Those partnerships have also helped the legacy player woo some big-name restaurants away from Resy through cash incentives made possible by the credit card companies.Recapturing top-tier restaurants with Michelin stars or James Beard awards has been a priority for OpenTable over the last five years, said OpenTable CEO Debby Soo.\"Credit card companies are looking for a perk to differentiate their cards, especially for their premium cardholders,\" Soo said. \"Especially after Covid, the experiential has become even more important.\"Delivery's hereNow, DoorDash is entering the fray with its SevenRooms acquisition. The company is used to fighting for market share in a competitive industry. Before the pandemic, DoorDash was up against UberEats and Grubhub for market dominance of online third-party food delivery. As of 2025, DoorDash was the biggest player in the U.S. market, with about 67% share, according to digital restaurant operations firm Deliverect. UberEats trails with a 23% share.Eric Baradat | AFP | Getty ImagesAs it enters the bookings game, DoorDash is looking to capture the range of dining possibilities, whether it's delivery, takeout or table.In the early months of its reservations integration, the platform was offering users DoorDash cash per booking to use on future delivery orders. And in select cities, it offers exclusive tables at trendy spots for members of DashPass, its subscription service.Above all, the integration with SevenRooms gives DoorDash and its restaurants access to more data about diners. \"Delivery and dine-in have typically been siloed data sets,\" SevenRooms co-founder Joel Montaniel said. \"So if a customer has ordered six times, and they're coming into the restaurant for the first time, are they a first-time customer or a seventh-time customer?\" Following a diner across touchpoints means a better experience, and more tailored marketing, he said. \"We're seeing the flywheel happening and the excitement about the DoorDash reservation marketplace happening, but it's still early days,\" said Parisa Sadrzadeh, vice president of strategy and operations for DoorDash. \"We've got a lot of room to continue to grow.\" ",

    "body": "View of the city of Santiago and the Andes Mountains, taken from the Metropolitan Park on July 2, 2024.Rodrigo Arangua | Afp | Getty ImagesChile is the latest Latin American country to have become embroiled in a U.S.-China power struggle.The country, which counts Washington as its top foreign investor and Beijing as its largest trading partner, is facing pressure from the White House over a subsea cable project with links to China. In a surprise move, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late last week that the Trump administration would impose visa restrictions on three Chilean officials tied to a digital cable project proposed by Chinese firms, alleging a security threat. Chilean President Gabriel Boric, who will leave office on March 11, condemned the visa sanctions and rejected the notion that the country \"promotes any action that threatens our security or that of the region.\" Chile's outgoing left-wing government later said one of the sanctioned officials was the country's Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Juan Carlos Muñoz, without commenting on the identities of the other two.The U.S. ambassador to Chile, Brandon Judd, defended the visa restrictions on Monday, telling reporters that it is Washington's \"sovereign right to take actions when we feel that the region's security is being threatened,\" according to The Associated Press.The spat comes just days before a Latin American leader's summit in Miami, Florida — and two weeks before Chile's incoming right-wing government takes over in Santiago. Chile's President-elect Jose Antonio Kast speaks to journalists after meeting with the Italian Prime Minister at Palazzo Chigi in Rome on Febuary 5, 2026.Filippo Monteforte | Afp | Getty ImagesIt also represents a major test for José Antonio Kast's administration, following the right-wing candidate's election victory late last year.Analysts say U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking to counter China's strategic influence in the region, is sending an unequivocal message to Latin American countries. 'A calibrated warning'The U.S.-Chile tensions were, above all, \"a calibrated warning\" to the Kast administration that strategic infrastructure decisions will be treated as geopolitical alignment choices — rather than neutral tenders, according to Mariano Machado, Americas principal analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.To be sure, digital undersea cables are the backbone of the world's internet and telecommunications infrastructure, enabling everything from international phone calls to financial transactions. By some estimates, as much as 95% of international traffic passes through these largely unseen data super-highways.A map of the world's undersea communication cables.CNBC | Jason Reginato\"The near-term external consequence is that Kast's upcoming Washington engagements – chief among them, in the Shield of the Americas summit – will become early tests of how Chile balances partners under pressure,\" Machado said.\"As US-China competition intensifies in the region, Chile's 'digital hub' ambition becomes investable only if geopolitical concerns are addressed upfront, not retrofitted after a crisis,\" he continued. \"Winning deals will be those that lock in clear governance and credible security assurances early enough to preserve bankability.\" China's embassy in Chile has reportedly accused Washington of \"obvious contempt for the sovereignty, dignity, and national interests of Chile\" following the Trump administration's visa restrictions against Chilean officials.China's strategic and economic influence in Latin America is well established, although it is thought to be the target of Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" — a portmanteau of Donald Trump and the Monroe Doctrine, which refers to a 19th century foreign policy position that asserted Washington's influence over the Western Hemisphere.watch nowIn just the last few weeks, for example, Panama's top court ruled against Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, saying a concession held by a subsidiary of the firm to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional. The outcome was widely seen as a victory for Trump's regional security ambitions. The U.S. has also ratcheted up pressure on Cuba's communist-run government, threatening to impose tariffs on any country that provides oil to Havana, and recently conducted an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrive to hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 13, 2025.    Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia will likely continue buying Russian oil as the U.S. Supreme Court's verdict outlawing President Donald Trump's import tariffs has constrained his trade policy options, analysts said.\"I do expect that India will maintain a healthy relationship with Russia, including on energy,\" Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South Program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft told CNBC's Inside India. He added that India could reduce its Russian oil purchases but is unlikely to stop completely.According to energy data provider Kpler, India has imported 1.16 million barrel per day (mbd) of Russian oil so far in February, lower than an average intake of 1.71 million barrels per day in 2025.While it is too early to draw data on March and April arrivals, Muyu Xu, senior research analyst for crude at Kpler, said that \"market chatter indicates\" Indian refiners have refrained from booking April delivery of Russian oil this month following an interim US-India trade deal reached earlier this month.But following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on Friday that Trump did not have the legal authority to implement sweeping import tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Xu said India now has the room to maintain Russian oil imports between 800,000 and 1 million barrels per day.According to Shidore, Trump's ability to amend tariffs for reasons such as the purchase of Russian oil or factors unrelated to trade or economics will be constrained due to the court ruling.India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not respond to CNBC's request for comments.watch nowA thorny issueIndia's purchases of Russian oil have been a thorny issue and led to the deterioration of ties between the U.S. and India last year. In August, Trump imposed a 25% additional tariff on Indian goods to punish New Delhi for buying Russian crude, claiming that India was \"fueling [Russia's] war machine\" against Ukraine. This, in addition to the 25% reciprocal tariffs the U.S. already had in place on Indian goods, meant that Indian exports to the U.S. faced total tariffs of 50%, the highest amongst all of the U.S.' trading partners.Following the interim trade deal, the U.S. slashed its tariff on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.In an executive order on Feb 6, U.S. president Donald Trump removed its punitive 25% tariff on India, stating that New Delhi has \"committed to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil\" and will purchase \"energy products from the United States\".But the joint statement issued by India and the U.S., announcing the interim trade deal omitted any mention of India committing to curb purchases of Russian oil. However, the statement did feature New Delhi's intentions to buy half a trillion dollars worth of U.S. goods including energy over the next five years as part of the deal.India's commitments to reduce its purchases of Russian oil \"were never formally codified and always appeared difficult to implement in practice,\" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics.Hermann added that India's energy strategy is fundamentally driven by price considerations and a motivation to not being tied to any one supplier. \"US crude is unlikely to displace Russian barrels in any meaningful way,\" Hermann said.Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling against the IEEPA tariffs last Friday, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to first impose a 10% global import tariff. He subsequently increased the rate to 15%. But a U.S. Customs and Border Protection memo published Monday evening when the levy came into effect said the rate was 10%.India's trade negotiators have rescheduled their visit to Washington to firm up the interim trade deal. The visit will \"be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications,\" a source told CNBC's Amitoj Singh. \"India has continued to import Russian oil despite several tariff tactics,\" said Pankaj Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets at Rystad Energy. The U.S. court ruling against Trump's tariffs followed by the implementation of a blanket global tariff rate of 10% dilutes any advantage that Indian exporters to the U.S. would have had from the trade deal, analysts said. In light of the recent developments, Srivastava said that the U.S. would not push India hard on the issue of reducing its Russian oil purchases and risk the \"significant\" U.S. energy exports to India.India regularly buys U.S. crude of 200,000-300,000 barrel per day, according to Kpler. As of end-January, Russia was India's largest supplier of crude oil, while the U.S. ranked sixth, data from Kpler and Rystad Energy show.",

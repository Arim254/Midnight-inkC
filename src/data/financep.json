Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesCoffee delivery has turned into a $1 billion business for Starbucks.The coffee giant said on Wednesday that its annual delivery sales crossed the milestone in fiscal 2025, which ended on Sept. 30. In the company's fiscal fourth quarter, delivery sales climbed almost 30% compared with the year-ago period, executives said.The growth of Starbucks' delivery initiative comes as the company's broader U.S. business embarks on a turnaround. Starbucks reported flat U.S. same-store sales in the fiscal fourth quarter, reversing the previous seven quarters of domestic same-store sales declines as customers made their coffee at home or defected to rivals.The coffee giant began testing delivery roughly a decade ago, but Starbucks has been slower to roll it out than many other restaurant companies. Nationwide delivery became available through Uber Eats in 2020, DoorDash in 2023 and Grubhub last year. Today, the vast majority of the coffee chain's company-operated U.S. cafes offer delivery.U.S. consumers have also been slower to embrace coffee delivery than other markets, like China. In Starbucks' home market, drive-thru lanes and mobile order options offer similar convenience without the delivery fees.Perhaps to justify the higher cost, the typical Starbucks delivery order is nearly twice the size of an in-store transaction, according to the company. More than 40% of the chain's delivery orders include food.Though broader restaurant spending has slowed as consumers face higher costs, food delivery hasn't seen the same plummeting sales. Discounts and promotions have helped third-party apps hold onto customers, along with their moves to branch out into new categories, like alcohol and grocery delivery.",

    "body": "File photo of a U.S. LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile inside a silo about 60 miles from Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota.Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday directed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing \"on an equal basis,\" citing testing programs by other countries.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One after meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, Trump said the decision \"had to do with others,\" without naming specific countries.\"They seem to all be nuclear testing. We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing ... But with others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,\" he said, adding that details on the planned tests would be announced later.Before his meeting with Xi, Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.\"It was not immediately clear what Trump meant by \"equal basis.\" The Department of Defense was rebranded the Department of War on Sept. 5 under an executive order, though Congress has not approved the change.The announcement followed reports that Russia had successfully tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo on Wednesday.\"For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin was quoted as saying.Moscow also tested its new Burevestnik nuclear cruise missile on Oct. 21 and conducted nuclear launch drills a day later.The U.S. has not conducted a live nuclear weapons test since 1992, when then-President George H.W. Bush imposed a unilateral testing moratorium.In 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by then-President Bill Clinton.Trump also claimed in his Truth Social post that the U.S. has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, adding that Russia and China would match its nuclear weapon stockpile within five years — a statement contradicted by independent data.According to estimates by the Arms Control Association, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and the Federation of American Scientists, Russia possesses the most nuclear weapons in the world.Russia is estimated to have 5,459 nuclear weapons in 2025, compared to 5,177 for the U.S. and 600 for China, according to the Federation of American Scientists. The nonprofit was founded in 1945 by atomic scientists after World War II to advocate for international oversight of nuclear energy.",

The central bank instead decreased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point.Miran joined the Fed in September after being appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Schmid voted for the rate decrease in September, despite expressing some doubt about lowering interest rates during a CNBC interview in late August.",

A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had put Shell's expected third-quarter profit at $5.09 billion.The London-headquartered firm reported adjusted earnings of $6 billion over the same period last year and $4.26 billion for this year's April-June period.\"Shell delivered another strong set of results, with clear progress across our portfolio and excellent performance in our Marketing business and deepwater assets in the Gulf of America and Brazil,\" Shell CEO Wael Sawan said in a statement.The company also announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns. The company said it marked the 16th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks.Shell's net debt came in at $41.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from $43.2 billion on a quarterly basis.The oil major's London-listed share price has climbed more than 16% year-to-date, outperforming its industry peers.Other third-quarter highlights included:Adjusted earnings fell 9.9% compared to the same period last year.Cash flow from operations (CFFO) came in at $12.2 billion for the third quarter, compared to $14.7 billion in the same period last year.Cash capital expenditure for the quarter stood at $4.9 billion.Shell's results come as French oil major TotalEnergies reported a slight drop in third-quarter profit as oil and gas production growth helped to offset lower crude prices.Norwegian energy firm Equinor, for its part, on Wednesday posted a steeper-than-expected drop in third-quarter profit, with adjusted operating income coming in at $6.21 billion for the July-September period.U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both scheduled to report third-quarter results on Friday, with Britain's BP set to follow suit on Tuesday.Analysts expect Big Oil's shareholder payouts to come under pressure over the coming months, with energy majors looking to tighten their belts amid a weaker crude price environment.",

Defense product maker Firstec also rose as much as 9.7%.Automakers Hyundai and Kia saw gains of around 12% and 9% respectively.The agreement, detailed following a meeting between President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, includes lower U.S. tariffs on South Korean goods in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul — a move that could reshape trade and defense ties between the two allies.Under the new terms, U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports will drop to 15% from the earlier \"tariff letter\" rate of 25%. South Korea's $350 billion investment pledge reportedly includes $200 billion in direct investment and $150 billion allocated to shipbuilding cooperation.The $200 billion in investment would be capped at $20 billion per year, South Korea's chief policy advisor, Kim Yong-beom, was reported as saying.Trump also said in a Truth Social post that he had approved South Korea to build a nuclear submarine in \"the Philadelphia Shipyards.\" This would be Seoul's first nuclear submarine.South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha had made a $5 billion investment into the Philly Shipyards back in August as part of Seoul’s earlier commitment to invest $150 billion.\"As President Trump and President Lee make shipbuilding a central plank in the U.S.-Korea alliance, Hanwha stands ready to support with our advanced shipbuilding scale,\" Alex Wong, Hanwha Chief Strategy Officer, said in a statement.South Korea's Yonhap also reported that a fact sheet covering both the trade and security components of the agreement between Seoul and Washington will be released in the coming days.",

    "body": "The American multinational chain Starbucks Coffee store and logo seen displayed. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesStarbucks on Wednesday reported that its quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, showing that its turnaround strategy is winning over lapsed customers.The coffee chain's global same-store sales rose 1%, lifted by international markets. Its U.S. same-store sales were flat for the quarter but turned positive in September. Wall Street was projecting global same-store sales declines of 0.3% and a 0.9% decrease in U.S. same-store sales.\"We're a year into our 'Back to Starbucks' strategy, and it's clear that our turnaround is taking hold,\" CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement.Domestic same-store sales turned positive in September, and the company has held onto that momentum through October, Niccol said on the company's conference call. However, CFO Cathy Smith cautioned analysts against cheering too soon.\"Turnarounds are difficult to forecast, and while we have good reason to believe that our U.S. company-operated [same-store sales] should build through the year, we also know that recoveries are not always linear,\" she said.The company suspended its annual forecast a year ago, and it is not expecting to release a near- or long-term outlook until an investor day slated for late January.Shares of Starbucks rose 2% in extended trading.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Sept. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 52 cents adjusted vs. 56 cents expectedRevenue: $9.57 billion vs. $9.35 billion expectedThe coffee giant reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to Starbucks of $133.1 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring costs, litigation settlements and other items, Starbucks earned 52 cents per share. During the quarter, the company closed 627 locations and laid off roughly 900 nonretail employees as part of a restructuring plan.In addition to the restructuring plan, Starbucks has been investing heavily in labor, including adding assistant store managers to many North American cafes. The added labor costs weighed on its operating margin this quarter.Net sales rose 5% to $9.57 billion.To revive U.S. sales, Starbucks has focused on improving the in-store experience for customers and cutting service times to under four minutes per order. More than 80% of company-operated locations have an average service time of four minutes or less, even as the chain saw a rise in traffic after it launched its fall menu, according to Niccol.The company's marketing efforts have switched from promotions and limited-time items to highlighting its coffee and trendy innovation, like protein-packed cold foam.The strategy has succeeded in winning back some U.S. customers. Smith said that the number of 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members grew 1% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.Outside Starbucks' home market, same-store sales increased 3%, fueled by a 6% jump in traffic.In China, the company's second-largest market, same-store sales rose 2%, boosted by a 9% climb in traffic. Under pressure in the country from home-grown rivals with cheaper beverages, Starbucks has lowered prices on many of its iced drinks to bring back customers.The company is also exploring selling a stake in its China business after years of sales declines in the competitive market. Niccol previously told CNBC's Jim Cramer that the company values the China business at more than $10 billion.\"On the strategic front, we have had very strong interest from multiple high quality partners, all of whom see significant value in the Starbucks brand and team,\" Niccol said on Wednesday. \"We expect to retain a meaningful stake in Starbucks China and remain confident in the long term growth potential in the region.\"",

    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSamsung Electronics reported a rebound in earnings on Thursday, with operating profit more than doubling from the previous quarter, bolstered by strong memory chip demand from artificial intelligence servers. Here are Samsung's third-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 86.1 trillion Korean won ($60.5 billion) vs. 85.93 trillion won Operating profit: 12.2 trillion won vs. 11.25 trillion wonThe South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose 8.85% from a year earlier, while its first-quarter operating profit climbed 32.9% in the same period. Samsung shares popped nearly 4% in early trading in Asia.The earnings represent a bounce back from the June quarter, which had been weighed down by a massive slump in Samsung's chip business. Operating profit increased by 160% compared to June, while revenue increased by 15.5% over the same period. Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest company by market capitalization, is a leading provider of memory chips, semiconductor foundry services and smartphones.The company's earnings were lifted by its chip business, which saw operating profit increase over tenfold from the June quarter on strong demand for AI servers.Samsung predicted that AI chip demand would continue to grow, echoing sentiments from memory rival SK Hynix, which reported earnings on Wednesday.\"We expect data center companies to continuously expand their hardware investment because of the ongoing competition to secure AI infrastructure,\" a Samsung executive said during an earnings call.\"Therefore, our AI-related server demand keeps growing, and this demand significantly exceeds industry supply,\" he added.Chip Business Samsung's chip business reported a 19% increase in sales from the June quarter, with its memory business setting an all-time high for quarterly sales, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence.Chip revenue increased to 33.1 trillion Korean won, up 13% from last year, while operating profit rose 81% to 7.0 trillion Korean won over the same period.Also known as its Device Solutions division, Samsung's chip business encompasses memory chips, semiconductor design and its foundry units.Samsung said the unit benefited from a favorable price environment, while quarterly revenues reached a record high on expanded sales of its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips — a type of memory used in artificial intelligence computing.The company has found itself lagging behind memory rival SK Hynix in the HBM market, after it was slow to secure major contracts with leading AI chip Nvidia. However, in a positive sign for the company, it reportedly passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM chip last month.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month found that Samsung had reclaimed the top spot in the memory market ahead of SK Hynix in the third quarter after falling behind its competitor for the first time the quarter prior. MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that Samsung's third-quarter performance was a clear result of a broader \"memory market boom\" and rising prices for general-purpose memory.Heading into 2026, Samsung said its memory business will focus on the mass production of its next-generation HBM technology, HBM4.Smartphones Samsung's mobile experience and network businesses, tasked with developing and selling smartphones, tablets, wearables and other devices, reported a rise in both sales and profit.The unit posted an operating profit of 3.6 trillion won in the third quarter, up about 28% from the same period last year. The company said earnings were driven by robust flagship smartphone sales, including the launch of its Galaxy Z Fold7 device.Samsung forecasted that the rapid growth of the AI industry would open up new market opportunities for both its devices and chip businesses in the current quarter.",

    "body": "The Japanese national flag is seen at the Bank of Japan (BoJ) headquarters in Tokyo on July 31, 2024. The Bank of Japan lifted its main interest rate on July 31 for just the second time in 17 years in another step away from its massive monetary easing programme.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank on Thursday kept benchmark interest rates steady at 0.5% in its first meeting after Sanae Takaichi took power as the country's prime minister earlier this month.The decision was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and comes even as inflation has stayed above the central bank's 2% target for 41 months in a row.The Bank of Japan said the decision was split 7-2, with board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata proposing a 25 basis point hike.Market reaction to the expected decision was relatively muted, with Japanese 10-year bond yields little changed, the yen 0.2% weaker at 153.03, while the Nikkei stock index was up 0.4%.Krishna Bhimavarapu, APAC Economist at State Street Investment Management, said in a note after the decision that there was an \"increased likelihood\" of a rate hike within the next two policy meetings when global trade-related volatility is better assessed.\"Nonetheless, the Bank is still likely to move only gradually in the next year as well,\" she added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThis BOJ verdict comes as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday met with Satsuki Katayama, the new finance minister in the Takaichi administration, and appeared to take aim at Tokyo over the yen's weakness, even commenting on the country's monetary policy.In a statement on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department said that Bessent \"highlighted the important role of sound monetary policy formulation and communication in anchoring inflation expectations and preventing excess exchange rate volatility.\"Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency by inviting foreign flows, while lower rates tend to weaken it.The weak yen has been a sticking point for the U.S. President Donald Trump, who said in March that Tokyo had weakened its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage. Trump met with Takaichi, who has been an advocate of lower interest rates and has called BOJ's rate hikes as \"stupid\" in the past.While Takaichi appears to have softened her stance, this push to strengthen the yen is still at odds of with her plans for massive fiscal spending and a loose monetary policy.\"What's most important is for the BOJ and government to coordinate policy and communicate closely,\" Takaichi said on Oct. 21, according to Reuters.Takaichi is seen as a proponent of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of the late Shinzo Abe that espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.On Wednesday, Bessent wrote on X that \"the government's willingness to allow the Bank of Japan policy space will be key to anchoring inflation expectations.\"Katayama said in March that yen's real value was likely at about 120-130 against the dollar, about 26% stronger than the current level of around 152.Takaichi's policies are likely to devalue the yen, according to experts, something that has already happened in the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" that saw the Nikkei 225 hit record levels and the yen weaken beyond the 150 level against the dollar.The BOJ's decision also comes against the backdrop of a relatively weak export landscape. Japan's exports contracted for four straight months, before seeing a rebound in September, although shipments to the U.S. have still been declining.",

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Sept. 25, 2024.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta shares dropped as much as 9% on Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat on sales, but it also reported a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $7.25 adj. vs. $6.69 estimatedRevenue: $51.24 billion vs. $49.41 billion estimatedMeta said that the implementation of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act resulted in the one-time, non-cash income tax charge. The company said it expects Trump's law to result in \"a significant reduction\" in its U.S. federal cash tax payments for the rest of 2025 and future years.The company's third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year, which is its highest revenue growth since the first quarter of 2024.Meta said it expects fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $56 billon to $59 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in above what was expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.The company raised the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion, saying expenses will come in between $116 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $118 billion.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta consistently requires more computing power for its artificial intelligence initiatives, resulting in more spending on related data center and cloud services.\"That suggests that being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over, over some period,\" Zuckerberg added.The company also raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures, which will now come in the range of $70 billion to $72 billion. It's prior outlook was between the range of $66 to $72 billion.Meta's Reality Labs hardware unit reported a third-quarter loss of $4.4 billion on $470 million in sales.Revenue for Reality Labs in the fourth quarter is expected to come in lower than it did for the same period in 2024, Meta finance chief Susan Li said on a call with analysts. Li said that was due to the company not releasing a new VR headset this year and because retailers who bought inventory of Meta's previous headset for the holiday shopping season did so during the third quarter.\"We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,\" Li said.The company in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are Meta's first consumer-ready AI glasses with a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology. Zuckerberg said the product is sold out and that demo slots are booked through the end of November.\"We're going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,\" he said.The company said that it saw 3.54 billion daily active people across its apps for the quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of 3.5 billion daily active people.Meta's advertising sales were $50.08 billion during the third quarter, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $48.5 billion.The company has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.Meta said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.Meta said that its employee headcount was 78,450 as of Sept. 30, representing an 8% year-over-year increase.The company in September added Vibes to its Meta AI app. That feature is a feed of AI-generated videos. Since Vibes was released, downloads of Meta AI on both iOS and Android are up 56% month-to-month to a total of 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.\"Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,\" Zuckerberg said.Correction: Analysts expected Meta revenue to come in at $49.41 billion. That number was misstated in the earlier version of this story.WATCH: Meta reports Q3 earnings beat, company takes one-time tax chargewatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve meeting that wrapped up Wednesday both delivered on expectations and offered a few surprises. Here are five key takeaways:The Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, delivered its quarter percentage point rate cut, but not without some backstage intrigue that included two dissenting votes — one in each direction. While Governor Stephen Miran delivered a widely anticipated \"no\" vote because he preferred a half-point reduction, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid wanted no cut, speaking for what is an apparently growing group of inflation hawks who are worried about the Fed's easing bias.Using uncharacteristically strong language, Chair Jerome Powell pushed back hard on another cut in December for which markets had been assigning about a 90% probability of happening. \"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\" He went on to note there were \"strongly different views\" expressed by the 19 meeting participants and noted that the tone would be reflected in the meeting minutes, released in three weeks.Markets knew the end of QT was coming, but just weren't set on when. The committee laid that to rest and said quantitative tightening, or allowing assets to roll off the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, would end after the November operations. While Powell doused talk of a December cut, ending QT then could have a similar impact. At the same time, the committee indicated it would be reinvesting maturing mortgage notes in short-term bills, which Powell said will tilt the balance sheet to shorter duration with an even stronger lean toward Treasurys.On the question of inflation, Powell gave indications that it is drifting back towards the Fed's 2% goal but remains elevated — around 2.8% by the Fed's preferred measure. Tariffs are providing a boost to that number in the half percentage point range, but Powell said the view continues to be that the impact from the levies will be temporary. The inflation forecast for October is significant in that the Commerce Department will not be releasing an official number on the personal consumption expenditures price index due to the government shutdown.Powell gave a nod towards the uncertainty from the shutdown, but said the lack of public data likely doesn't change the economic picture, one of moderating growth, rising unemployment and \"somewhat elevated\" inflation. \"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" he said.What they're saying:\"He kind of did a WWE slam on those expectations of a December rate cut. [The door is] not completely closed, I guess, but it was expected to be a foregone conclusion. And he came out pretty vociferously and said, 'Nope, better not think about it that way.'\" — Dan North, senior economist at Allianz\"So, regardless of the use of alternative data sources the Fed can draw on, we believe there is an increased chance that December's meeting may skip a cut, which would push off further accommodative rate moves into the new year, and potentially to a new Chair.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and finalist for Powell's job when his term as chair expires in May\"He tried to say it is not a foregone conclusion, but a December rate cut still seems likely. No Fed leader wants to be responsible for a slowdown or a recession.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union",

Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesMicrosoft took a $3.1 billion hit to its net income in the first quarter due to the software company's hefty investment in OpenAI.In its earnings report on Wednesday, Microsoft said the drop in profit reflected an \"equity method investment,\" resulting in a 41-cent decline in earnings per share. Net income still rose to $27.7 billion, or $3.72 per share, from $24.67 billion, or $3.30 per share, a year ago.Since first backing OpenAI in 2019, Microsoft has committed to invest $13 billion in the company, with $11.6 billion already funded as of the end of September, according to a filing.The announcement comes a day after OpenAI announced that it completed a recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business. The nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm.Read more CNBC tech newsApple's iPhone Air doesn't look like a best-seller.

Just ahead of that disclosure, OpenAI announced a prototype of a search engine called SearchGPT.Microsoft has largely relied on OpenAI's models to power AI features in its key products. But in August, Microsoft said that it had begun publicly testing a homegrown AI model that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers.Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings and profit on Wednesday.

    "body": "BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News  Beijing on Thursday paused export controls on rare earths, while Washington cut fentanyl-linked tariffs, following a high-stakes meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea.The Chinese export controls, announced on Oct. 9, will be delayed by one year, while the U.S. will similarly postpone implementation of measures announced Sept. 29 that expanded restrictions on blacklisted companies to include their majority-owned subsidiaries, China's Ministry of Commerce said.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he left South Korea that the meeting with Xi was \"amazing\" and that \"a lot of decisions were made.\"\"Rare earth issue has been settled,\" Trump said, adding that it was a 1-year agreement that will be negotiated every year. The fentanyl-linked tariffs will be lowered to 10% from 20%, effective immediately, Trump said, bringing down the levy on Chinese exports to 47% from 57%.In return, Beijing will \"work very hard to stop fentanyl\" and resume purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural products.Soybean futures on the Chicago exchange were down 1.6%, while China's CSI Rare Earths Industry Index was up more than 2%, according to LSEG data.On the sale of Nvidia's chips to China, Trump said the two sides had discussed \"a lot of chips\" but not the most advanced Blackwell chips. \"They are going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips,\" he said.Taiwan was not part of the discussion, Trump said.The U.S. decision to cut fentanyl-related tariffs to 10% addresses \"a key Chinese grievance,\" said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group, showing that \"Beijing's efforts to curb exports of fentanyl precursors, long unrecognized by Washington, are finally being acknowledged.\"Trump said he will be going to China in April, followed by Xi's trip to the U.S., without specifying a timeline for his Chinese counterpart.The results of the meeting, announced by Trump so far, are \"exceeding expectations,\" in part thanks to the two leaders' personal diplomacy that was strong enough not only to halt the escalation but to deliver results that seemed unthinkable, said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at Ankura Consulting's GreenPoint Business.That said, frictions will not go away entirely as several bilateral issues core to the U.S.-China rivalry remain outstanding, he added.It was the first time that Trump and Xi met in six years and the summit lasted one hour and 40 minutes.watch nowIn a statement published by Chinese state media Xinhua after the meeting, Xi called for \"dialogue over confrontation,\" urging that both sides should maintain regular working-level communication. That's according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese statement.Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration on trade, energy and economic issues, and to facilitate cultural and people-to-people exchanges, the statement read.While the trade truce is \"welcome news,\" any indication of addressing underlying structural matters of concern is missing — such as China's industrial excess capacity and non-market economy practices — said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute.That means that the truce is \"fragile and tensions are certain to heat up again,\" Cutler added.'Partners and friends'Before the meeting, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump calling Xi \"an old friend\" with whom he has a \"very good relationship,\" and Xi stressing that China's economic growth ambitions would not undermine Trump's vision to \"Make America Great Again.\"Tensions between the world's two economic superpowers have been on a boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing  export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. The U.S. had in recent days shared details about deals they hoped to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths were also on the table for discussion.Beijing had been more circumspect about the prospects of an agreement, but in a possible sign of thawing relationship, China bought its first cargoes of U.S. soybeans in several months, Reuters reported Wednesday. Heading into the meeting, Xi shook hands with Trump at the photo-op at Gimhae Air Base in Busan, urging that Washington and Beijing be \"friends and partners\" in his opening remarks.Sitting across the table from Trump, the Chinese leader said it was a \"great pleasure\" to meet the U.S. president for the sixth time, adding that it was only \"normal\" for the two economic superpowers to have \"frictions now and then.\"\"China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to Make America Great Again,\" Xi said, according to a readout by the Chinese foreign ministry.That conciliatory tone marked a notable shift from Xi's meeting with the former U.S. President Joe Biden late last year, during which the speech highlighted more \"inevitable competition\" between the two countries, said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.While the agreement still lacks a \"strong structural foundation\" and could easily be reversed, both sides are likely to stick with it in the near term to signal goodwill, Su added.",

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChinese and Hong Kong markets fell Thursday as investors assessed the first in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping since Trump began his second term.Mainland China's CSI 300 fell 0.8% to end at 4,709.9, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.21% in its final hour of trade, reversing earlier gains, after the meeting concluded.Trump said he had reached a one-year agreement with China on rare earths and other critical minerals, and that Washington will cut fentanyl-related tariffs on Beijing to 10% after their meeting in South Korea.Other Asia-Pacific markets were mixed on Thursday, after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a rate cut in December was far from a \"foregone conclusion.\"The Fed on Wednesday slashed the benchmark federal funds rate by 25 basis points, as expected, to bring it to 3.75%-4%.South Korea's markets will also be in focus after Seoul's chief policy advisor Kim Yong-beom reportedly released details of the trade deal with Washington.South Korea will invest $200 billion in the U.S., with an annual cap of $20 billion a year, while the remaining $150 billion of its $350 billion total pledge announced earlier this year will be used for shipbuilding cooperation, according to local media reports.The Kospi added 0.14%, with gains seen in auto and shipbuilding stocks, to close at a fresh record of 4,086.89, while the small-cap Kosdaq fell 1.19% to 890.86.Japan's Nikkei 225 ended just above the flatline at 51,325.61, while the Topix rose 0.69% to finish at 3,300.79.This comes as the Bank of Japan kept benchmark interest rates steady at 0.5% in its first meeting after Sanae Takaichi's rise to power as the country's prime minister earlier this month.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.46% to end at 8,885.5 and marking its third straight day of losses.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed lower Wednesday after Powell's remarks, having hit a record high earlier in the session.The Dow closed down 0.2% at 47,632.00, while the S&P 500 ended marginally lower at 6,890.59.However, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.55% to a fresh record close of 23,958.47, propped up by a rise in Nvidia.—CNBC's Sean Conlon and Sarah Min contributed to this report.",

Li said this is in part because the company did not introduce a new VR headset in 2025.\"We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,\" Li said.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in September revealed the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which are the company's first consumer-ready AI glasses that include a built-in display and an accompanying wristband with neural technology.EssilorLuxottica said in its most recent earnings report earlier this month that those AI glasses helped lift its sales in the third quarter.\"Clearly there is a lift coming from Ray-Ban Meta wearables as a product category,\" EssilorLuxottica CFO Stefano Grassi said during a third-quarter earnings call.With Meta's AI glasses becoming a surprise hit, investors have been monitoring for any signs that the company may be shifting its metaverse strategy.Meta on Monday said that Vishal Shah, who was leading its metaverse initiatives, is now a vice president of AI products in the company's Superintelligence Labs division that works on AI.WATCH: Market volatility reflects AI trade anxiety ahead of Mag 7 earnings.watch now",

    "body": "A customer carries a Chipotle bag in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChipotle Mexican Grill on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue that fell short of expectations and cut its same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Shares of the company plunged 13% in extended trading.Chipotle is expecting its full-year same-store sales to shrink by a low-single digit percentage in fiscal 2025. That's a big change from February, when the burrito chain was projecting same-store sales would grow by a low- to mid-single digit percentage.CEO Scott Boatwright said the company is seeing \"consistent macroeconomic pressures.\" Traffic fell by 0.8%, the third straight quarter of declines.After the chain outperformed the broader restaurant industry in 2024, the sluggish consumer environment finally hit its restaurants this year. Chipotle's customer base skews higher income, so it was insulated from the pullback in spending from low-income consumers that fast-food chains were reporting last year.But now Chipotle is seeing consumers across all income cohorts visit less frequently. Consumers who make less than $100,000, who account for roughly 40% of the company's customer base, have further pulled back their spending, Boatwright said. He added that the group is dining out less often due to concerns about the economy and inflation.Customers between the ages of 25 and 35 years old are particularly challenged, he said on the company's earnings call.\"We tend to skew younger and slightly over-indexed to this group relative to the broader restaurant industry,\" Boatwright said.He cited headwinds like unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation, which are hurting that particular group of consumers.\"We're not losing that customer. They're just coming less often,\" Boatwright said.watch nowHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 29 cents adjusted, in line with expectationsRevenue: $3 billion vs. $3.03 billion expectedShares of the restaurant chain fell about 5% in extended trading.Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $382.1 million, or 29 cents per share, down from $387.4 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding slight adjustments for stock-based compensation grants and other items, the burrito chain still earned 29 cents per share. Net sales rose 7.5% to $3 billion, fueled by new restaurants. The company opened 84 company-operated locations and two licensed international stores.Chipotle's same-store sales increased 0.3% in a reversal from last quarter's decline. But the growth in sales at restaurants open at least a year came from a 1.1% bump in average check, as traffic dipped.\"While we did see encouraging results as we accelerated our marketing spend and rolled out carne asada and red chimichurri, our underlying trends remain challenged throughout the quarter and into October,\" CFO Adam Rymer said.Boatwright stood by the chain's overall value proposition, saying that it would not turn to discounting to bring back customers. However, he acknowledged that consumers are lumping the chain in with other fast-casual competitors, whose average prices are closer to $15 per entree than Chipotle's roughly $10 price point.To revive traffic growth, Chipotle is focusing on its in-restaurant execution, marketing, digital experience and menu innovation, according to Boatwright.Looking to 2026, Chipotle anticipates that it will open 350 to 370 new locations. That target includes 10 to 15 international restaurants operated by partners, as the company aims to expand globally.Last month, Chipotle announced a joint venture with SPC Group, a Korea-based restaurant operator. It has also signed development deals with operators in the Middle East and Latin America.",

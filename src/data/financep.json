    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's The Moment series, where highly successful people reveal the critical moment that changed the trajectory of their lives and careers, discussing what drove them to make the leap into the unknown.Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe left Google and built a startup that was \"profitable from Day 1,\" operating at a $2.2 million run rate by September 2023, Amin says. They predicted continued success, forecasting monthly revenue to multiply at least five-fold by late-2024.Then, they shuttered the whole thing to start over from scratch — all due to ChatGPT, says Amin.Today, Amin and Lowe, both 33, are the co-founders and co-CEOs of Anything, a vibe-coding startup valued at $100 million following an $11 million funding round in September, according to the company. The business was originally known as Create, a marketplace connecting startups to freelance engineers and artificial intelligence-powered coding tools to build websites and apps.Why blow it up? Amin cites \"the ChatGPT moment\" in November 2022, when OpenAI debuted the generative AI chatbot. Its leap in capabilities from previous AI models \"was a surprise to everybody,\" Amin says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossBy spring 2023, Amin and Lowe predicted that AI could eventually approach human developers' ability to write sophisticated code. If that happened, human engineers might not be needed at all, rendering their business obsolete.But if they rebuilt their company around AI and the technology didn't advance rapidly enough, their new model would be a flop. Clients would bolt and the company would run out of money.After months of anxious deliberation, in October 2023, Amin and Lowe undertook the difficult process of laying off half of their seven-person staff and cutting ties with freelance developers, says Amin: \"Within two weeks, we were back to an empty office.\"They first launched an AI-powered tool to build app components like login forms and calendar tools. In April 2025, they released a new product for building entire online businesses, including backend authentication and payments systems, no coding experience necessary — and renamed the company Anything.\"That was actually the moment where it felt like it really took off,\" says Amin. Within two weeks of the company's relaunch announcement, Anything reached a $2 million annualized revenue run rate, he says.The AI coding industry is \"extremely early\" in its development, says Amin, as evidenced by overall mixed reviews for vibe-coding services. Still, non-technical users have built functional commercial apps with Anything, including a hair salon owner's AI stylist mobile app and a dental hygienist's app for tracking gum health, Amin wrote in a Sept. 29 blog post.Here, Amin discusses his realization that AI could upend their entire business model, the anxiety of determining whether to start over, and getting the timing right when launching a startup in an emerging industry.CNBC Make It: You decided to shut down and rebuild in October 2023. How painful of a decision was that, and what was the reaction from your company's investors?Amin: We went back to zero, so that was hard. We had to let go of half of the team. We had to shut down the developer marketplace and tell our customers we weren't going to do this with devs anymore.At the time, people were still kind of scoffing: \"Is this AI thing going to be real? Are you actually going to be able to build real apps [with just AI]?\"We had raised [$3 million] of venture capital. We had promised [investors] that we were going to hit [specific] timelines. Then, we went back to everyone and told them, \"Actually, no, we're going to go back to zero.\" Everyone was like, \"Are you sure?\"As you and your co-founder tracked AI's advancements, what were your conversations like?We talked all the time. We would revisit the position, like, once a month. It took me and Marcus a very, very long time to both come to the conclusion [to start the business over], and it felt like one of those decisions that both of us, as co-founders, needed to agree with.There'd be times where I was more bullish on the prospects of the [original] marketplace and what we could do with it. There were times where Marcus would be more bullish. And there were times where both of us were like, \"This technology is advancing so fast and we're using it in more and more places, does it just make sense to build a new product?\" That was hard.I think what ended up breaking that logjam for us was: We launched a few prototype builders, just to test and see if there was demand for [code-generation products] where you don't have to talk to any of us, you just can use it. That gave us some early signal. When we talked to our customers, it felt like the code-gen system had product-market fit.How confident were you that the underlying generative AI technology would keep advancing exponentially?Confident, but unconfident on the timescales. That was the scariest part. Through 2024, large language models kind of hit a plateau, to some extent, in capability. It was very unclear through that time how good [that technology] would end up getting. There were definitely [times] where it was like, \"Oh, boy. Did we make a mistake in trying to pivot?\"Could we even build something valuable and useful enough that people would want it and pay us for it? We had many opportunities to pivot to a quicker win, which would be: \"Let's make a prototyping tool. Let's make a design tool, because all [LLMs] can do is components. We'll sell it to agencies.\"What stopped you?Marcus and I always had this [mindset] that we'd already gone through one really big pivot trying to align closer to the mission of the company. That pivot would've been for naught if we didn't actually accomplish the mission of the company, which is that people should be able to build real production products, even if they don't know how to code.It's a useful founding story now: This company will stick through it, even if the technology shifts, even if the business model shifts. At the time, it was hard. Now, I can say with some pride: You don't have to just take my word that we're serious about what we're trying to do here. We've painted it in blood, sweat and tears.I expected it would take about a year to get this technology good enough to build real production systems. In reality, it has taken about two and I still think we're at the start. The sophistication of apps you can build with Anything — what it will look like in a year, or even two years, is just going to be dramatically different.I hope our hardcore pivots are behind us, at this point. Now, I think we're just more in the [mindset]: Let's execute, let's take advantage of opportunity, and let's really grow it.Where would your business be today if you hadn't shut down the marketplace to focus on AI?It's so hard to tell. I wonder if the company would still exist? Would the business we were building then still be attractive to [investors]? I think marketplace models like that, while popular in 2021, have really fallen out of fashion unless you're more pure AI [focused].This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

    "body": "Nandi Owolo's first foray into junk journaling came by accident.One day in June 2024, Owolo fell while walking her dog. \"I started junk journaling because I broke my foot on my birthday, of all days,\" she tells CNBC Make It.She was homebound on doctor's orders for two months of recovery. Then, by way of some TikTok scrolling, junk journaling came into her life.The L.A. resident says junk journaling, described as \"as a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art,\" made her feel crafty for the first time in her life. \"I personally think that I have no artistic skill,\" says Owolo, now 30. \"I can't draw; I can't knit; I can't paint.\" Arranging and gluing down souvenirs, photos and stickers into chaotically colorful spreads? That she could do.Junk journaling, also considered \"Gen Z's version of scrapbooking,\" has taken off in recent years. Enthusiasts say they like that the hobby keeps them off their phones. It taps into the nostalgia of collecting and displaying physical media. And there are no rules in arranging personal mementos from the grand, like concert tickets or birthday cards, to the everyday, like a restaurant napkin or coffee sleeve.The hobby is \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\" come to life, and its embrace of imperfection is part of the appeal, Owolo says: \"It's an artistic medium in which you can do whatever you want with the page,\" she says.Junk journaling, a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art, has taken off in recent years thanks to enthusiasts wanting a screen-free creative hobby.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloAdd in an element of in-person gathering, which many young people are craving post-pandemic, and Owolo says she felt she had a hit on her hands.Two months after beginning her own crafting journey, Owolo launched the social media handles for Junk Journal Club and hosted her first meetup through a local social club where she was a member. The event quickly reached maximum capacity at 35 people, which Owolo says signaled to her that there was a big demand.Owolo soon held her second event at a park with 60 people. A year and a half later, she now regularly hosts ticketed events for 20 to 30 guests at $35 to $50 a pop between one and three times per month. Owolo says she believes her Junk Journal Club is the first U.S. club dedicated to hosting real-life events for the hobby. She also launched a Discord channel for users around the world to connect, share inspiration, post their pages and send each other care packages via a pen pal program. The group now boasts nearly 2,000 members around the U.S. and internationally, including Canada, Germany, Australia and beyond.From job loss to entrepreneurshipMay 2025 marked a turning point for Owolo and her Junk Journal Club. The entertainment professional lost what she calls her \"dream job\" working to turn books and comics into TV shows and movies.While grieving the \"heartbreaking layoff,\" Owolo says she recognized an opportunity in Junk Journal Club.\"As cliche as it is, it's like I had this other thing that I had more control over,\" she says. \"No one can lay me off from Junk Journal Club. It is mine.\"Owolo got to work figuring out how she wanted to grow the business and decided to go after branded events. She set a goal to collaborate with two brands by the end of 2025.Nandi Owolo launched Junk Journal Club in August 2024 and turned it into her full-time business in 2025. She hosts one to three events each month, which often sell out quickly.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloShe found her first partner in Nuuly, the clothing rental service, which came about from \"sheer emailing and networking,\" Owolo says. The brand covered the cost of supplies and other fees for an event in November, making it free for guests. It was also the first time Owolo was paid as a creator to make several Instagram Reels videos for the clothing company's social media feeds.Throughout the fall, Owolo says she hosted five collaborative events, including with artist and creative director Ramisha Sattar, Australia-based artist and author Martina Calvi (whom Owolo calls the \"junk journaling queen\"), and Paramount Pictures to promote its movie \"Regretting You.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now. Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.Nandi OwoloOwolo says she was reluctant to call herself an entrepreneur as someone who had, up until now, never tried to make money from a side hustle.\"It almost felt fraudulent,\" Owolo says. She questioned herself: \"Am I allowed to call myself an entrepreneur? Am I allowed to call this a business? And eventually I was like, 'I absolutely am allowed to call it that.' It just took a while.\"Growing the business in 2026Owolo says she's still actively applying for a new full-time role in marketing and brand management, and that she hopes hiring managers will see her work with Junk Journal Club as an asset. She's currently working a contract job for a beverage company to fill in for someone on maternity leave, though that ends in January.She says that she isn't taking a salary from Junk Journal Club and that all ticket sales go back into the events themselves to cover supplies for attendees, food and drink, the venue rental, and a goodie box with stationery and stickers for guests to take home afterward.Owolo says her goal is to be able to pay herself from Junk Journal Club, but that for now, she's focused on giving \"people the best experience possible.\"\"I recognize that there is a way that I could have hosted all these events and paid myself a little bit of money,\" she says, \"but it would have been at the sacrifice of less sticker sheets, or not getting a custom thing made for the event. I've not yet reached the point where I'm willing to sacrifice those things.\"Owolo intends to grow slowly and intentionally. Though she says her events tend to sell out, usually within an hour of tickets going live and as fast as under a minute, she prefers to cap gatherings at 20 to 30 guests to curate a cozy atmosphere.Looking ahead to 2026, Owolo says she hopes to land more brand partnerships for collaborative projects.Junk Journal Club events usually accommodate 20 to 30 attendees. Tickets often sell out within an hour, or as quickly as a few minutes, of going on sale.Ximena Escobar\"L.A. is the land of activations and experiential marketing,\" she says. To touring musicians, she proposes, why not work with her on an event where eager fans create a collage inspired by their favorite song? Or for the many brands that host influencer dinners, might a junk journaling session pair well with dessert?In the meantime, Owolo expects the appetite for in-person crafting will only grow.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now,\" she says. \"Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "Alphabet-owned Waymo has suspended its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after blackouts plagued the city Saturday afternoon.\"We have temporarily suspended our ride-hailing services in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the widespread power outage,\" a Waymo spokesperson tells CNBC. \"Our teams are working diligently and in close coordination with city officials, and we are hopeful to bring our services back online soon. We appreciate your patience and will provide further updates as soon as they are available.\"Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday around 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldThe power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods as transit service gradually resumed. \"Waymo has also paused service,\" Lurie said.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.Waymo did not say when its service would resume and did not specify whether collisions involving its vehicles had occurred during the blackout.Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment.This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The image, which contained two separate photos showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday.  The image showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenza.One of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein, and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan, New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche early Sunday said the image was removed from the website after learning there were concerns about women in the photo, \"so we pulled that photo down.\"\"It has nothing to do with President Trump,\" said Blanche on NBC's \"Meet the Press.The disappearance of the files came despite a law signed by Trump that required the agency to make public all of the so-called Epstein files by Friday.The image went live on the DOJ's website on Friday, and disappeared from the webpage several hours later. The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all DOJ files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.",

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChip giant Nvidia (NVDA) is considered to be one of the key beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to robust demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). The stock has been under pressure recently due to concerns about valuations of AI plays and growing competition in the AI chip space from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Alphabet-owned Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). Nvidia is also facing uncertainty related to chip exports to China amid geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Despite ongoing pressures, several top analysts remain bullish on Nvidia for several reasons, including its solid track record, strong execution, continued innovation and dominant position in the AI GPU market. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on NVDA stock with a price target of $205.Let's look at the views of three such Wall Street pros who are bullish on Nvidia's growth potential. Vivek Arya – Bank of AmericaFollowing a virtual meeting with Nvidia's vice president of investor relations, Toshiya Hari, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock with a price forecast of $275, saying that he continues to view it as a top pick.Among the key takeaways, Arya mentioned that while Nvidia agrees that Gemini 3 is a top large language model (LLM) that is trained on Google's in-house TPU, the company contends that it is too early to declare a clear winner. Specifically, the company emphasized that the existing GPU-based LLMs available were all trained on old Hopper (2022) architecture and cannot be compared with the upcoming LLMs that are trained on NVDA's Blackwell (2024) GPUs.Arya highlighted that management is confident about the expected launch of the Blackwell-backed LLMs in early 2026, which would prove that \"they are at least a full generation ahead of competition.\" In fact, external benchmarks like MLPerf and InferenceMAX view Blackwell as the clear leader in both training and inference, with Nvidia standing out in terms of key metrics like tokens per watt and revenue per token.The five-star analyst added that Nvidia continues to have demand and supply visibility into at least $500 billion of revenue opportunity for Blackwell, Rubin and networking for calendar years 2025 to 2026. Interestingly, the recent deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Anthropic/Microsoft are incremental to this $500 billion outlook (as they are letter of intents) and represent potential upside.Overall, the meeting reinforced Arya's bullish thesis, with the analyst finding NVDA stock's valuation attractive. Specifically, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 25x and 19x of 2026 and 2027 earnings, respectively, imply only a 0.5x PEG ratio. That's compared to the average of 2x for the Magnificent Seven stocks and growth competitors.Arya ranks No. 270 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. Stacy Rasgon – BernsteinBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is also upbeat about Nvidia's prospects and has a buy rating on the semiconductor stock with a price target of $275. In his latest note to investors, the analyst discussed some interesting takeaways from his virtual investor meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia.Rasgon noted that the $500 billion outlook announced in October for cumulative Blackwell, Rubin and networking sales for calendar years 2025 and 2026 will likely see an upside, as it doesn't include new deals such as that with Anthropic, the OpenAI 10 GW collaboration, and partnerships in the Middle East.On concerns about competition from Google's in-house chips, Rasgon noted that while Nvidia acknowledges the progress that Google has made in more than 10 years, the company believes that it is about two years ahead of the search engine giant's TPU program.Nvidia argues that, given the evolving AI market, it will be challenging for Google to persuade cloud service providers to deploy TPUs as they are meant for specific model structures. \"But they believe NVIDIA's programmable platform solutions remain the best hardware for cloud AI infrastructure,\" said Rasgon.Regarding President Donald Trump's recent post about allowing Nvidia to ship H200 AI chips to China, subject to a 25% cut that goes to the U.S., Rasgon noted that Nvidia is still waiting to secure licenses to ship H200s, after which it intends to look into demand requests and commence manufacturing. Moreover, Nvidia has not yet obtained any details about the 25% revenue sharing with the U.S. government and is currently unclear about how this fee will be accounted for.Rasgon ranks No. 144 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. Blayne Curtis – JefferiesIn a research note on the 2026 outlook for semiconductors, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $250. Curtis called Broadcom (AVGO) as the top pick, citing ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) inflection and the highest level of estimate revisions expected for the company in the semiconductor group. That said, he remains bullish on Nvidia.\"We haven't given up on NVDA given the technology moat and valuation at 18x the $10 EPS bogey,\" said Curtis.The five-star analyst contends that ASIC adoption is still in its early phases, giving Nvidia plenty of room to grow amid robust spending. He thinks that ongoing worries about NVDA are overstated, given that Blackwell Ultra rollout is on track and Rubin is set to ramp in the second half of 2026.Furthermore, Curtis noted Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space and expects the company's Vera-Rubin and NVLink 6 launches in the second half of 2026 to bolster its position. He expects Blackwell-backed LLMs to be introduced in the first half of 2026 and act as a potential catalyst for NVDA stock.Curtis also expects Nvidia's launch of its new CPX chip in the second half of 2026 to benefit from higher capital spending by hyperscalers and rising focus on inference. The analyst currently expects CPX to generate revenue of $13 billion in calendar year 2027. Based on all these positives, Curtis raised his 2026 and 2027 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Nvidia to $7.82 and $9.50 from $6.83 and $9.03, respectively.Curtis ranks No. 58 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.8%.",

    "body": "Sad female worker carrying her belongings while leaving the office after being firedIsbjorn | Istock | Getty ImagesLayoffs have been a defining feature of the job market in 2025, with several major companies announcing thousands of job cuts driven by artificial intelligence. In fact, AI was responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.There were in total 1.17 million job cuts through 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when there were 2.2 million layoffs announced by the end of the year. In October, U.S. employers announced 153,000 job cuts, and there were over 71,000 job cuts in November, with AI being cited for over 6,000 for the month, per Challenger. At a time when inflation bites, tariffs are adding to expenses, and firms are looking to carry out cost-cutting measures, AI has presented an attractive, short-term solution to the problem. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study in November showing that AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market and save as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. Not everyone is convinced that AI is the real reason behind the dramatic job cuts, as Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC, that it might be an excuse. Stephany said many companies that performed well during the pandemic \"significantly overhired\" and the recent layoffs might just be a \"market clearance.\"\"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying 'we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'\" he added.Here are the top firms that cited AI as part of their layoff and restructuring strategy in 2025. Amazon Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesIn October, Amazon announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history, slashing 14,000 corporate roles, as it looks to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes AI. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\"  Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned of the cuts earlier this year, telling employees that AI will shrink the company's workforce and that the tech giant will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\" Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the CES event in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2024. The event typically doubles as a preview of how tech giants and startups will market their wares in the coming year and if early announcements are any indication, AI-branded products will become the new \"smart\" gadgets of 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has cut a total of around 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent announcement in July saw 9,000 roles on the chopping block. CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that the company needed to \"reimagine\" its \"mission for a new era,\" and went on to tout the significance of AI to the company. \"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve,\" Nadella said.

However, unlike other companies that had cited AI in job cuts, Krishna admitted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. In November, the company announced a 1% global cut, which could impact nearly 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike said in May that it's laying off 5% of its workforce or 500 employees, and directly attributed the cuts to AI. \"AI has always been foundational to how we operate,\" co-founder and CEO George Kurtz wrote in a memo included in a securities filing. \"AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.\"Workday Carl Eschenbach, CEO of Workday speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBC In February, HR platform Workday was one of the first companies this year to say its cutting 8.5% of its workforce, amounting to around 1,750 jobs, as the company invests more in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were needed to prioritize AI investment and to free up resources. ",

    "body": "Vladimir Godnik | Fstop | Getty ImagesFor years, Braden Wallake has posted everything from business lessons to animal pictures on his LinkedIn page. A fateful midweek post on a late-summer day stopped the marketing executive in his tracks.Wallake shared a teary-eyed selfie with a message about his feelings after laying off staff. Just like that, he was the \"Crying CEO.\"\"I woke up the next day, texted my marketing person and said, 'I think I went viral last night,'\" said Wallake, whose post has raked in more than 57,000 reactions and 10,000 comments.Users blasted the HyperSocial CEO as being \"manipulative\" and displaying \"self indulgence.\" The photo \"would make a great dart board,\" another wrote.Corporate executives and founders like Wallake were sold on the idea that a vibrant social media presence can boost their personal and firm-wide brand awareness. But the reality is less picture-perfect than it's made out to be.In many cases, these leaders come off not as relatable but as cringey. And they're learning the hard way that their digital footprints can even have material business implications.\"There can be real benefits from CEOs being online, but there can also be great risks,\" said Ann Mooney Murphy, a Stevens Institute of Technology professor who has studied how company leaders gain social media celebrity status. \"One needs to tread carefully.\"The online executiveThe pitfalls of social media usage for business leaders are becoming increasingly clear as more executives take to the platforms. Nearly three-fourths of Fortune 500 chief executives had at least one social media account last year, up from roughly half in 2019, data from Influential Executive showed.More than seven out of 10 Fortune 100 CEOs with social platforms posted at least once a month in 2024, a 32% increase from the year prior, according to an analysis from communications firm H/Advisors Abernathy released this week. CEOs have flocked in particular to the work-focused social site LinkedIn, where they post three times a month on average. An active social media presence can help build brand recognition and drive attention from mainstream news outlets, Murphy said. It can also allow executives to develop para-social relationships directly with consumers — something that was once reserved for more-traditional celebrities like actors or athletes, she said.While company news was king in these posts, H/Advisors Abernathy found executives devoting more social real estate to sharing personal happenings. This softer style of content — examples of which include Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing pictures from Taylor Swift's \"Eras\" tour and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon posting details for his DJ sets — can help keep followers engaged, Murphy said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon performs at Schimanski night club in Brooklyn, New York.Trevor Hunnicutt | ReutersA subsector has sprouted up around executives' social media habits, with several businesses offering training programs or consulting services focused on best practices. PayPal made waves in marketing circles earlier this year when it posted a \"Head of CEO Content\" role, which paid upwards of $300,000 in part to lead social media communications strategy.Promise and perilBut in recent years, a growing list of anecdotes like Wallake's \"Crying CEO\" experience show how posting through life can go awry.Jason Yanowitz boasted on X in October that Blockworks, the crypto company he co-founded, saw \"massive growth\" and hit \"record revenues\" in 2025. He also said the company was shuttering its news division and recommended staffers to anyone hiring journalists covering digital currencies.One user suggested that Yanowitz forgo smiley faces and strike a tone with less \"triumphancy\" in a post announcing job cuts. Someone else replied that \"before jumping into what's next,\" he should \"address the real people who were impacted.\"Yanowitz, who declined CNBC's interview request, later wrote on X that he \"should not have mentioned revenue\" in the original post.Around the same time as Yanowitz's tweet, a social media video featuring Snowflake revenue chief Mike Gannon offered a case study on how these incidents can evolve into real-world crises.In an Instagram clip viewed millions of times, Gannon told a street interviewer that the data storage firm was slated to rake in $10 billion \"in a couple of years.\" Shortly after, Snowflake said in a regulatory filing that statements made in the interview were not authorized and that investors \"should not rely upon\" them. The company declined to make Gannon available for an interview.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared visions for his business ventures on social media in between musings about politics and cultural issues. Two years ago, Musk found himself in court defending comments related to business plans made on X, his social media platform formerly known as Twitter.Alex Spiro, attorney to Elon Musk, center, departs court in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023.Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn several instances, readers have responded directly to executives whose content they find problematic or cringe-inducing. Some, like Ryan Benson, have also mocked the broader trend of business leaders' attempting to connect directly via social media.\"It's just disingenuous,\" said Benson, 28. \"They're not trying to speak with people the way that maybe an influencer has success in. They're trying to talk at people to make them think something about their position.\"Executives' missteps on social media can catalyze discontent from investors, consumers or employees, according to Murphy of the Stevens Institute of Technology. In some situations, she said social media statements could lead to increased regulatory or legal risk for the companies they represent.Is all attention good?Despite the downfalls, corporate leaders who have seen the underbelly of social media don't regret being online.HyperSocial's Wallake said he initially took time away from LinkedIn to let the dust settle and now thinks twice before making a post. But Wallake still recommends other business managers harness social media to grow their brands given the benefits. If someone does bring up his teary picture, Wallake brushes it off.\"If people want to call me the 'Crying CEO,' they're more than welcome to,\" Wallake said. \"If they actually get to meet me, they're going to see me smiling way more often than they're going to see me ever crying.\"When Yehong Zhu, co-founder of media technology startup Zette AI, jumped on a day-in-my-life trend, responders roasted her over perceived laziness. People said she should be \"embarrassed\" and was \"fundamentally useless to society.\" One commenter said they were \"printing this out and taping it to the wall to remind me every time I catch myself believing in meritocracy.\"Zhu received handwritten hate mail tied to the post sent to her office. But she also noticed a flood of press coverage that included the company's name and signups to a product waitlist, underscoring the power of publicity — even if it's negative.\"After there was this huge influx of attention, I realized, you know what, maybe all attention is good attention,\" Zhu said. \"As long as your name is in their mouth, you're doing something right.\"Zhu later understood that her post was taken as \"rage bait,\" a genre of content so infamous that Oxford named it the 2025 word of the year. She's currently undergoing a social media rebrand and is considering leaning toward controversial posts — with the hope of winning more attention online.\"I was not trying to rage bait,\" she said of the original post. \"The day that I actually try to rage bait, everybody will be actually enraged.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyAn industry focused on death faces an existential crisisFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments.

    "body": "Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsIf you're unwrapping chocolate this holiday season, it might not contain any actual cocoa.Market turbulence, ethical concerns and sustainability questions have sparked a movement among some chocolate makers to scrap cocoa in favor of alternative ingredients — prompting calls that the real deal could soon become a \"luxury\" for consumers.  Market upheaval Poor agricultural conditions in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire — the world's leading cocoa producers — have damaged crop yields in recent years, sending cocoa prices on a rollercoaster ride. After surging to all-time highs of more than $12,000 toward the end of last year, cocoa futures have tumbled more than 50% over the course of 2025 amid tentative signs of crop recovery. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCocoa futuresPrice volatility has left businesses in the industry on edge, and it's ultimately found its way into consumer goods, with data from Circana and the U.S. Bureau for Labor Statistics showing chocolate prices surged 30% in the year to October.In its third-quarter earnings report, Mondelez International — the maker of Cadbury, Milka and Toblerone — flagged \"volatility of cocoa\" and its \"ability to effectively hedge against\" related cost pressures as potential problems that could derail the company from meeting its financial targets. As manufacturers grapple with that unpredictability, some are opting to reduce their exposure to the cocoa market by shaking up their ingredient mix. Earlier this year, a change to the composition of McVitie's Club and Penguin candy bars made waves in the U.K., when it was reported that the products could no longer be referred to as chocolate. Both products must now be labeled \"chocolate flavored,\" after parent company Pladis cut the cocoa content in a bid to reduce costs. 'Real' chocolate becoming a luxuryPladis declined to comment on whether the changes had impacted sales when contacted by CNBC. However, according to Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and CEO of Italian startup Foreverland, a move away from cocoa is gaining traction among international confectioners, so much so that it could become the norm to see \"fake\" chocolate used in more budget-friendly products. Foreverland uses carob, pumpkin seeds, and chickpeas to produce a chocolate-like product that's sold to companies producing confectionery, baked goods, and ice creams.\"In the chocolate space there are many products, from [bars] to products in which cocoa is not really the protagonist but a participant,\" he told CNBC, referring to goods like cookies, chocolate flavored cereal and chocolate-coated snacks. \"I believe the alternative chocolate will substitute this big market, while [pure chocolate bars] will be more and more a luxury product.\"Sabatini pointed to the recent Dubai chocolate trend to illustrate his point, noting that some of these chocolate bars were selling for as much as 80 euros ($93.09) per kilogram. \"[The chocolate market] is already going in this direction,\" he argued. watch nowOn top of the pricing pressure, Foreverland and other alternative makers tout their products as solutions to longstanding concerns about sustainability and ethical procurement in the cocoa industry. \"If you compare this alternative to other alternatives on the market, like a plant-based burger, chocolate is used in so many different applications, while a burger is a burger,\" Sabatini said. \"Chocolate can be a snack, can be a bar, can be a biscuit, can be whatever. There are hundreds of different products in which chocolate is not a protagonist, in which alternative chocolate can really be a solution, to bring more sustainable products on the market, but at the same time depressurize the cocoa supply chain.\"Drew Geraghty, a New York-based commodity broker at ICAP, told CNBC that despite signs of price recovery on the futures market, pure chocolate could continue to command high prices for some time to come. Large cocoa users typically lock in prices far in advance, often covering eight to ten months of production, which gives them more control over price risk, but Geraghty said smaller manufacturers don't have that flexibility, so they usually only hedge three to six months out.Futures are contracts in which the buyer of the contract agrees to buy something — in this case, cocoa — for a set price on a set date. Cocoa futures for March delivery were last seen trading at $5,897 a ton in New York.  Geraghty noted that manufacturers who bought futures eight months ago were buying the higher prices seen throughout late 2024 and early 2025. \"If you look back when the prices really skyrocketed in 2023 and 2024 and early '25, the price on the shelf did not respond as quickly because the end users were still getting through their lower price futures cover — what they bought in the futures market six to eight months ago was going to dictate pricing,\" he explained. \"Cheaper prices today, with the market being down, say 50% from the beginning of the year, that will translate into cheaper prices six to eight months down the road on the retail side.\"watch nowJessica Karch, the marketing manager for German firm Planet A Foods — which makes a chocolate alternative derived from sunflower seeds — agreed that cocoa alternatives will become increasingly prevalent in the future. \"We do believe that the issues that we see currently in the supply chain of cocoa won't go away,\" she said. \"So, the prices might stabilize to a certain point, but it will not go back to how [cheap] it was in the past.\"Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsKarch said Planet A was already seeing growing demand, and noted that there was an increasing variety of alternatives coming onto the market. \"We do love chocolate, we do not want to replace chocolate, but we see a growing gap as well,\" she added. \"Because on the one hand, you have the issues in the supply chain, but on the other hand, you have the demand growing, especially in countries like China and India, and that's why we see a gap, and we want to help fill that gap.\"Market 'PTSD' driving alternatives marketBoth Karch and Sabatini told CNBC that demand was rising for their products. And they aren't alone in the market — a number of startups, including the U.K.'s Nukoko and America's Voyage Foods — offer what the former calls \"cocoa-free chocolate.\" Natasha Linhart, CEO of fast-moving consumer goods wholesaler Atlante, told CNBC that chocolate alternatives would likely become more prevalent in \"specific niches and hybrid applications.\"\"Cocoa-free or fermentation-based masses are increasingly being used in coatings, fillings and bakery to substitute part of the cocoa content,\" she said. \"Many manufacturers are already diluting cocoa by shifting their mix towards 'filled' products. Brands like Milka, for instance, have expanded ranges where a significant share of the bar is filled with yoghurt cream or rice crispies, lowering the cocoa intensity while keeping the perception of indulgence and value.\"watch nowLinhart said she expected to see more products where traditional cocoa is complemented with fillings to manage cost and supply risk. \"However, for mainstream chocolate tablets, cocoa will remain the backbone of the category, because of taste expectations and the emotional weight attached to 'real chocolate,'\" she said. ICAP's Geraghty said that due to \"PTSD in the market,\" cocoa alternatives were likely to be increasingly used wherever manufacturers can get away with it. \"At one point, cocoa butter was three times the price of cocoa futures, so cocoa futures were at $9,000, $10,000 a ton, and you were looking at cocoa butter at $27,000 to $30,000 a ton — massively expensive,\" he said. \"So [manufacturers] scramble — you make a smaller bar size, you find substitutes where you can. Even though prices have halved, [they'll be thinking] why should we spend that when we could substitute shea butter or some compound chocolate?\"",

    "body": "watch nowLucid Motors gets rave reviews from critics. But it's sorely lacking customers.    That's a problem the company can't afford. The Arizona-based EV maker has top-shelf tech, deep-pocketed backers, and highly praised cars. However, it has struggled to meet production targets, and has been unable to steal the spotlight away from established luxury brands with century-old pedigrees. Lucid is ramping up production of its high-end, three-row, Gravity SUV, though it has sold only a few hundred units so far in 2025. The Gravity's production ramp has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages. Yet the company already has plans for another vehicle aimed more at the middle of the market, where it would compete with the top-selling Tesla Model Y SUV. And it's investing in self-driving cars for consumers while working on a robotaxi fleet with Uber and self-driving tech maker Nuro. A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, ArizonaIn the process, Lucid is burning through a lot of money. The company's third-quarter results were worse than Wall Street expected, with a net loss of close to $1 billion.  \"Their gross profit has been getting kind of worse,\" said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"A lot of people are doing the math. How long can the company keep losing cash?\"Adding to its challenges is a tougher environment for all EV manufacturers. Demand has fallen short of expectations, and many automakers are pulling back. EVs have lost key support from the federal government, including a $7,500 tax credit, funding for charging, and restrictions on state level programs that incentivize automakers to produce zero-emission vehicles. A 'fantastic car'Lucid's first vehicle, a sedan call the Air, is the most popular vehicle in its segment, according to Cox Automotive. Through the third quarter, it was the third best-selling full-size luxury sedan, and the top selling electric one, according to the company. The Air is frequently a \"critic's pick.\" No other EV can touch the 512-mile range of the Air Grand Touring, one of its top trim levels.  Last year, Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles, the majority of which were Air sedans, a 71% increase from 2023. U.S. EV leader Tesla delivered 1.8 million. Unfortunately, sedans have consistently compared to SUVs, crossovers, and pickups--which now all but dominate the roads. Of the top 10 best-selling models in the U.S., seven are from those three segments, according to Edmunds. \"It was a fantastic car,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry. \"It still is a fantastic car. But it came to market at kind of the wrong time.\"Marc Winterhoff, interim chief executive officer of Lucid Group Inc., in a Lucid Air Grand Touring model in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, July 17, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn 2023, Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world, according to JATO Dynamics. It sold more than 265,000 units in the U.S. through the third quarter of 2024, according to Cox Automotive, about 100,000 more than the Model 3 sedan. Among EVs, the Model 3 is unusually popular for a sedan. Behind the two Tesla Models, the three vehicles that round out the top five are crossovers — Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq5. The Model S, the Air's closest Tesla competitor in terms of size, performance, and price, sold just over 4,500 units in the same period.  The highest volume EVs, such as the Model Y, are also less expensive than the Air, which starts just above $70,000 and runs up to about a quarter of a million dollars. The Model 3 is nearly half that. The average EV transaction price in November was just above $59,000, according to Cox Automotive. \"There's just not enough of a market for those premium electric sedans right now,\" Abuelsamid said. Lucid sold slightly more than 300 Gravity SUVs in the US through the third quarter of 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Like the Air, the Gravity has a high price tag. Nevertheless, the company has said the Gravity stands to attract six times as many customers as the Air. \"We'll see if that's the case,\" said Narayan. \"The latest numbers I've seen show it kind of equalizing the sales of sedans.\"Lucid interim CEO Mark Winterhoff told CNBC in an interview that the company has seen \"a very good uptick in demand when it comes to the Gravity as compared to the Air.\" He added that most customers are configuring the car in ways that run the price up above $100,000. Production troubleDemand might be strong, but Lucid also has to get the vehicle into customers' hands. Gravity's launch earlier in 2025 was beset by shortages of key materials like magnets, aluminum, and chips, Winterhoff said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"We haven't been able to produce as many as we wanted up until this point,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"We're very confident right now that we solved those problems.\"Deliveries have risen for seven straight quarters, culminating in a 47% percent jump over the third quarter of 2024. Lucid has added a second shift to the final assembly section of its factory to meet demand.The company said demand has been resilient despite worries the EV market is stalling after the federal EV incentive ended on Sept. 30.\"In October, our delivery numbers went up,\" Winterhoff said. \"Whereas in many other pure EV players or even EVs for incumbent players that also have [internal combustion] vehicles, the deliveries dropped down drastically.\"watch nowStill, analysts say it's a tougher time to make EVs than it was when Tesla was ramping up the Model 3 and Model Y. \"They were the only game in town,\" Narayan said. \"So there wasn't competition there. They also benefited from battery prices falling significantly. And they got a lot of government support. Today we're in a very different world.\" If gross profit does keep getting worse, the company will eventually have to return to investors, Narayan said. Lucid is currently about 55% owned by the Saudi Public Investment fund, according to FactSet.In the third quarter, Lucid and the PIF agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion. A DDTL is a loan the company can draw on over time, rather than all at once. That brings its total liquidity to $5.5 billion. The company has said it has enough to get through the first half of 2027.CNBC tours Lucid Motors factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Andrew Evers\"So far, the Saudis have put many billions of dollars into Lucid, and they've been very patient through Lucid's struggles as they try to ramp up production and sales,\" said Abuelsamid. \"It's unclear how long they will continue to be patient.\"The company also received a $300 million investment from Uber in September to develop a platform for robotaxis with a third partner, autonomous driving tech developer Nuro. On top of that, Uber plans to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles for the self-driving fleet. Separately, Lucid has a partnership with Nvidia to develop what it calls the \"the first true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off (L4) consumer owned autonomous vehicle.\" L4 means Level 4, nearly the highest level of autonomy in the current system devised by the Society for Automotive Engineers.\"You need to invest first and then you reap the benefits later on,\" Winterhoff said. \"And therefore we have to do a lot of things in parallel.\"Smaller SUV on the wayDespite Gravity's production challenges, the company is already at work on its next vehicle — a mid-size crossover priced closer to the industry average of about $50,000. This could boost volumes, but deepen losses. \"If gross profit is negative at a vehicle transacting around $100,000 or more on average, what Lucid's Air and Gravity are currently going for, what will it look like when the company is selling a vehicle that is closer to half of that?\" Narayan said. \"One answer could be, well, it's a much bigger scale, so you have better operating leverage,\" Narayan said. The argument, he said, is that Lucid's technology enables it to squeeze a lot more range out of a battery than competitors.\"Our vehicles are way more efficient by 30% to 40% than the competition, which means smaller battery use smaller battery to achieve the same range,\" said Emad Dlala, senior vice president of engineering and digital at Lucid. \"That means a lower [bill of materials] cost. That means better margins.\"Dlala said the Lucid Air Pure has a battery size of a Tesla Model Y, but has a range of 420 miles, about a hundred miles more than the Tesla Model Y. Lucid says the money it's spending goes to developing an array of technologies and manufacturing processes that are hard to copy. \"Lucid has about over 10 years of powertrain history,\" Dala said. \"This didn't come overnight. There's lots of IP patented technologies across powertrain, vehicle and software,\" which lead to \"gains in efficiency across the board,\" he said. Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThat even extends to the way the cars are made. \"We use manufacturing processes here that no one else in the industry uses in powertrain,\" said Adrian Price, senior vice president of operations at Lucid.\"Lucid is very highly vertically integrated,\" he said, meaning it brings much of the car-making process in house. \"We have a lot more of our own subassemblies. That's also how we get the performance that other people don't. A lot of that engineering is outsourced by other major automakers. Not only do we do the engineering, but we also do the manufacturing, and we can control some of the Lucid secret sauce by doing it in-house.\"One area where Lucid appears to lag competitors is brand awareness. \"A lot of people don't know what Lucid is,\" Narayan said. \"That's the biggest, I think, hurdle that they have.\"The company has given more thought to marketing, and raising its profile in the luxury market, where it's going up against names like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW. \"The buyer of a luxury brand, typically, they like things like heritage,\" Narayan said. \"The brand matters. So, you know, how do you create that from scratch?\"\"We are very well known and have tons of accolades in the motor press, Winterhoff said. \"So everybody who's interested in cars knows about it. But that's not the majority of vehicle buyers.\"So, it has begun a new marketing and advertising strategy for the Gravity, with Hollywood actor Timothee Chalamet as its first \"global brand ambassador.\" \"We're shifting from focusing on our vehicles, about the capabilities of our vehicles, to what does it mean to own a Lucid and what does it say about you?\" Winterhoff said. Winterhoff said he's confident the company can successfully ramp the Gravity, while building and eventually delivering its mid-size vehicle.  \"That is the point where I think this is a sustainable business going forward,\" he said. \"We have a clear plan also to profitability.\"Watch the video to get an exclusive inside look at Lucid's Gravity production and to find out what's next for the automaker.

    "body": "The Xbox booth during the Gamescom video games trade fair at the Trade Fair Center in Cologne, Germany, Aug. 20, 2025.Ina Fassbender | Afp | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's Xbox has had a tumultuous year.A slew of layoffs, price hikes and studio closures have led many to declare — not for the first time — that the Xbox is dead.Laura Fryer, former executive producer at Microsoft Game Studios, said in June that the company seems to have \"no desire or literally can't ship hardware anymore.\"Former Microsoft executive and ex-Blizzard Entertainment president Mike Ybarra slammed Xbox's \"confusing\" strategy in a now-deleted X post in October, saying the company is potentially heading for a \"death by a thousand needles.\"The company's overall gaming revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, with a 29% dip in Xbox hardware sales, according to Microsoft's first-quarter earnings for fiscal 2026.The broader console industry has been in a major slump, with hardware spending down 27% year-over-year in November, which is typically a busy shopping month, according to a recent report from research firm Circana.It was the worst November in two decades, IGN reported, citing Circana data. Combined Switch and Switch 2 unit sales were down more than 10% during the month and PS5 sales were down more than 40%, IGN said. But the Xbox Series hardware took the biggest beating, with a dramatic 70% drop in sales. In console sales, Xbox can barely see the leaders this year.Nintendo's Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since its debut in June, the company said in its latest earnings report. Sony's PlayStation 5 had 9.2 million units sold in 2025, according to its most recent financial results.Microsoft's Xbox Series S and Series X, at 1.7 million units, couldn't outsell the original Nintendo Switch, which launched in 2017 and has sold 3.4 million units so far this year, data from game sales tracking site VGChartz estimated.Microsoft declined to comment on Xbox sales or numbers.The company stopped reporting console unit shipments in 2015 as the gap between Xbox and PlayStation widened.The Series S, Series X and PS5 all originally released in 2020, with some updates being released since then.In November, Valve made a splash with its next-generation Steam Machine, which is set to launch next year.The reveal of its console-PC hybrid generated buzz across the gaming landscape, with The Verge declaring that \"Valve just built the Xbox that Microsoft is dreaming of.\"The mini cube will be able to run Windows PC games through Valve's own Linux-based SteamOS as a television console or as a gaming computer. Gamers will have access to Steam's extensive library of thousands of games.watch nowBut Microsoft doesn't seem too worried about falling behind.\"We're not in the business of out-consoling Sony or out-consoling Nintendo. There isn't really a great solution or win for us,\" Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a 2023 podcast.In congratulating Valve on the release, the Xbox boss gave a nod to the movement to expand gaming access \"across PC, console and handheld devices.\"As Sony and Nintendo have firmly established themselves as hardware companies, Microsoft is pushing toward Bill Gates' original vision of an all-encompassing entertainment hub in the living room.\"Ultimately, the addressable market is anybody who wants to play games, and Microsoft wants to serve that market,\" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told CNBC.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a recent interview with the TBPN podcast that the company's gaming business model will look to be \"everywhere in every platform,\" from consoles to TV to mobile.His comments also hinted that the next Xbox may function more like a PC.\"It's kind of funny people think about the console and PC as two different things,\" Nadella said. \"We built a console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. So I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.\"Xbox President Sarah Bond echoed the idea, saying in a recent interview with Mashable that the company's next-generation console will have \"some of the thinking\" seen in the Xbox's new handhelds, which were built by hardware manufacturer Asus in partnership with Microsoft.Launched in October, those devices support cross-platform gaming and can run PC games bought from Epic Games, CD Projekt and Valve stores.Xbox has already incorporated that approach into the latest Backbone Pro, which rolled out in November. Designed in partnership with Backbone Labs, the portable gaming controller offers access to cloud gaming on mobile, PC, smart TV and other streaming devices.So what will Microsoft's new-gen console look like?Little is known about where the company is at in its development. A source familiar with Xbox strategy told CNBC that the company is looking at creating an open system that enables players to jump between console, PC and cloud gaming — and any form of entertainment beyond gaming.Gaming in the cloudPachter said that while Microsoft is not completely abandoning hardware, the company is splitting its audience into existing buyers interested in specialized consoles and everyone else.In a 2019 interview with The Verge, Spencer said that he was not concerned with focusing on console sales as much as making games accessible.\"I do think as we look at the next decade of gaming, as we think about reaching the over 2 billion people on the planet who play games, many of those people won't be buying consoles and gaming PCs,\" Spencer said.Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which gives subscribers access to games from a variety of publishers, is a clear example of this strategy.Microsoft has been steadily expanding its title offerings on the service.The platform's most basic tier, Game Pass Essential (previously Game Pass Core), which costs $9.99 and launched in 2023 with 36 games, now offers over 50 titles.Ultimate tier members have access to over 500 titles.Sarah Bond, head of Xbox partnerships, speaks about Xbox Game Pass during the Microsoft Corp. Xbox event ahead of the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, June 9, 2019.Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe growth in cloud gaming has been blistering.Xbox reported a record 34 million Game Pass subscribers in 2024 and a total Game Pass revenue of almost $5 billion over the last fiscal year. Xbox said in a November blog post that the number of cloud gaming hours from Game Pass subscribers was up 45% compared to the same time last year. The Microsoft subsidiary also said console players are \"spending 45% more time cloud streaming on console and 24% more on other devices.\"In announcing the benchmark, the platform added that Xbox Cloud Gaming is now in 30 countries with the expansion into India, which it called \"the fastest-growing gaming market in the world,\" home to more than 500 million gamers this year.Although Microsoft faced heavy criticism from subscribers after increasing the cost of its Ultimate tier by 50% from $19.99 to $29.99 in October, the company is reportedly testing an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming.Omdia senior principal analyst George Jijiashvili told CNBC that a free Game Pass tier would likely act as a user-acquisition tool, especially for gamers who have not invested in consoles yet.However, due to the high costs associated with cloud gaming, an ad-supported tier would likely not be able to actually drive a meaningful amount of revenue, he said.Cloud gaming is inherently difficult to scale since it needs to balance computing power and operating costs with user affordability.\"With console-grade cloud gaming, you need to essentially run every single instance of the game in a server,\" Jijiashvili said. \"You need a dedicated hardware for every single person that's streaming the game, meaning it just doesn't scale.\"Despite gaming's scaling limitations, Microsoft seems committed to doing what it has done with the rest of its products — moving it to the cloud. \"They've evolved into a primarily cloud services company,\" Pachter said. \"So everything they've done since they started acquiring studios at Xbox has been toward the connected experience in the home to view entertainment.\"Game studio bonanzaMicrosoft has spent the past few years building out its entertainment hub with a catalog of original games through an acquisition blitz.In 2018, the software giant more than doubled its game studios with a string of acquisitions that included Ninja Theory, inXile Entertainment and Obsidian Entertainment.Two years later, Microsoft bought ZeniMax Media, which owned Bethesda, for $8.1 billion. It was the company's largest gaming acquisition until its 2023 purchase of Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion.Pachter said that the software giant's gaming spree was also a move to collect \"enough content\" to bolster its cloud gaming services. Yet Microsoft's approach to using its roster of exclusive titles has seen a stark shift recently.As Xbox exclusives still struggled to compete with wildly successful PlayStation games like \"Marvel's Spider-Man\" and \"God of War,\" the company has made a definitive pivot away from its original-content strategy.Bond recently said in an interview with Mashable that the idea of exclusive games is \"antiquated\" as the company has leaned into cross-platform gaming.Microsoft announced in October that the upcoming \"Halo\" game will be available on Sony's PlayStation 5, marking the first time the major franchise has become accessible on a competing console.In 2024, Xbox opened four formerly exclusive games to other consoles.Spencer said at the time that the move did not indicate a change in Xbox's exclusive strategy, but the company has since continued to bring several former exclusives to rival platforms.In a January interview, Spencer said that the company won't \"put walls up\" where users can engage with Xbox games.\"What we've learned is put the games first, make sure the games can be as great as they can,\" he said. \"We love the experience on our own hardware, on our own platform, but our games will show up in more and more places.\"Cuts and price jumpsMicrosoft laid off 1,900 workers, around 9% of its gaming division, in January and slashed another 650 jobs from Xbox in September.In May, the company also shut down several studios under game publisher Bethesda, including \"Redfall\" maker Arkane Austin and \"Mighty Doom\" developer Alpha Dog Games.The gaming unit was hit again when company-wide layoffs in July led to Microsoft shelving \"Perfect Dark\" and \"Everwild,\" games that have reportedly been in development for at least seven years, as well as multiple unannounced projects.Some have attributed the cost-cutting measures to mounting pressure to hit lofty profit goals.The company reportedly asked its gaming division in 2023 to target profit margins of 30%, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.The goal was a significant jump from the 12% profit margin Xbox reached in 2022, as revealed in court documents, and well above the average video-game industry standard of 17% to 22%, analysts told Bloomberg.Microsoft told CNBC that while the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.Microsoft has raised prices on its aging lineup of flagship consoles twice over the past year. Nintendo and Sony also announced price hikes for their respective consoles in August. The PS5 currently starts at $549.99, and the original Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 cost $399.99 and $499.99, respectively.Xbox's new ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X were priced at $599.99 and a staggering $999.99, respectively.With a growing number of consoles and handhelds in the market, competition is fierce for a dedicated group of customers that will always be interested in owning hardware.But Xbox is betting that cloud and cross-platform gaming are the future.For a decade, claims have been made about the death of the Xbox, and what comes next could fully spell the end, or bring a metamorphosis.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

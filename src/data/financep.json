Jesus Vargas | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his wife and four other people with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday morning after the couple's dramatic capture by American forces in their own country.\"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment alleges.The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, the indictment also charges Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduoro Guerra, Diosado Cabello Rondon, Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Read the indictment here.\"Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,\" the indictment said.\"That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, the defendant.\"Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges  other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, blasted the attack on Venezuela and its rationale\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie wrote in a post on the social media site X.",

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was \"controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.\"HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order \"reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China\" as it was made without a convincing rationale.The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.\"CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,\" the Treasury Department said.HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had \"successfully engaged\" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

President Donald Trump said Saturday that US forces had captured Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro after bombing the capital Caracas and other cities in a dramatic climax to a months-long standoff between Trump and his Venezuelan arch-foe. (Photo by ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP via Getty Images)Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba announced on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed in combat during the U.S. raid on Venezuela.The raid on Saturday, which saw U.S. forces arrest and extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to New York, reportedly saw a large part of his security team killed. The Cubans were performing missions on behalf of the Cuban Armed Forces and interior ministry, the country's presidential office said on Facebook.\"Faithful to their responsibilities with security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroically and fell, after ferocious resistance, into direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,\" the statement said, according to a translation by Facebook. Cuba also called the U.S. strikes a \"criminal act of aggression and state terrorism,\" and said the Cuban government will pay tribute to the dead.The U.S. strikes came after weeks of military buildup in the region and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump against Maduro. After the raid, Trump said that the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela, \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. will use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims.\"We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction,\" Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.Seperately, Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that as the U.S. has a \"quaratine\" on Venezuelan oil. \"That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" he added.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean.— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (L) and China's President Xi Jinping wave during a meeting in Miraflores Presidential Palace, in Caracas on July 20, 2014.Leo Ramirez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ancient Greek historian Thucydides once wrote that \"the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\" On Jan. 3, the United States appeared to echo that maxim when it launched strikes on Venezuela and, in a lightning raid, arrested President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.The couple was flown to New York to face drug and terrorism charges, drawing sharp criticism from foreign governments about the legality of the attack. The operation also reignited debate over whether Washington is reviving a world where might makes right. David Roche of Quantum Strategy told CNBC the operation could weaken U.S. arguments against similar actions by rivals.\"If Donald Trump can walk into a country and take it over… then why is Putin wrong about Ukraine, and why is China not entitled to take over Taiwan?\" Roche said.The U.S. has asserted what it calls a \"Trump Corollary\" in its recently released National Security Strategy, reviving the Monroe Doctrine of the 1820s, where the U.S. had a sphere of influence over the so-called \"Western Hemisphere.\"A sphere of influence refers to a region where a powerful country seeks to dominate political, military or economic decisions without formally annexing territory.The concept echoes the Roosevelt Corollary, which historically justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.A statement from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,\" calling the developments in Venezuela a \"dangerous precedent.\"Roche warned the action could create unintended consequences. \"On one hand, you've created a series of threats, and on the other, you've created a series of permissions to every dictatorial, autocratic regime, who wants to act to take over territory which is not currently within its ambit.\"The Taiwan questionIn Asia, attention has turned to whether China could be emboldened to increase pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.China staged live-fire drills around Taiwan in December, framing them as a warning against foreign interference. In his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared Taiwan's unification \"unstoppable,\" echoing U.S. intelligence assessments that Beijing could attempt to seize the island by force within this decade.Ryan Hass, a former U.S. diplomat and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against drawing direct parallels. \"There will be an impulse among foreign policy analysts to draw analogies to Taiwan and to warn about Trump setting a precedent Beijing could use against Taiwan. I would caution against that impulse,\" he  wrote on X.Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), Chinese President Xi Jinping (R), Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (L) and other leaders lay flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2015 in Moscow, Russia.Sasha Mordovets | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHass said China has avoided direct military action against Taiwan, not out of deference for international law or norms, but has instead relied on a strategy of coercion short of violence.\"Beijing will be more focused on protecting its interests, condemning US actions, and sharpening the contrast with the US in the international system than it will be on drawing inspiration from today's events to alter its approach on Taiwan,\" Hass wrote. China's foreign ministry, in a statement after the strike, said it was \"deeply shocked by and strongly condemns the U.S.'s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president.\"Beijing called the strike a  \"hegemonic act\" and called on Washington to \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security.\"\"The Trump administration, more so than any American administration in recent memory, is comfortable with great powers like China and Russia having a sphere of influence,\" said Marko Papic, chief strategist of macro-geopolitical at BCA Research. However, it does not mean that Washington is okay with these countries expanding their orbits, he added.Moreover, there does not seem to be an \"abandonment\" of Taiwan by the Trump administration, Papic told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\", pointing to the $11 billion arms sale that was announced by Taiwan in December. The U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to providing weapons necessary for Taiwan's self-defense.Rules for thee, not for meEvan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued the U.S. would likely pursue its own sphere of influence while denying one to China.\"The United States is NOT going to 'consent' to a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia,\" Feigenbaum wrote on X. \"Instead, I suspect it will attempt to insist on an American sphere of influence in its own Hemisphere while trying to deny one to China in Asia.\"\"Let's not pretend the U.S. is consistent and that contradiction and hypocrisy in U.S. foreign policy aren't a thing,\" he added in a separate post.BCA Research's Papic said that time was on China's side, and added it did not have to immediately act on Taiwan, while the U.S. is likely to focus on its \"Western Hemisphere.\"\"Why risk getting the entire Western world to unite against [China] by effectively trying to militarily reunify with Taiwan in January of 2026? Why risk it when time is likely on China's side over the next 10 years, as the U.S. continues to focus on the near abroad, and less so on the entire world.\"— CNBC's Chery Kang, Martin Soong and Amitoj Singh contributed to this report.",

Nonetheless, a temporary ramp-up of free internet services in the country could help provide connectivity amid the fallout of recent U.S. airstrikes and a ground raid to capture and extradite Maduro for trial on allegations including narco-terrorism and election rigging.  It is highly likely that Starlink will become available, for free, everywhere where the U.S. is involved in an antagonistic relationship with the regime.Marko PapicGlobal GeoMacro Strategist at BCA ResearchWashington's operations on Jan. 3 mostly targeted areas in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, with the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira also attacked, according to a government statement.Following the airstrikes, reports indicated that areas of Caracas had lost power and internet connectivity. Some local outlets also reported outages in Miranda over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that the U.S. would oversee Venezuela's transition, though details remain unclear amid concerns over a power vacuum.The president also announced Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in after Maduro's arrest, but has threatened a second strike on Venezuela if the leadership didn't \"behave.\"Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council plans to hold a meeting on Jan. 6 to discuss the legality of U.S. action, as countries, including U.S. allies such as Brazil and Spain, have condemned the military actions.  Starlink's growing global influence Venezuela is not the first conflict zone where Starlink has been deployed. The satellite service was rolled out in Ukraine in 2022 to replace internet and communication networks damaged by Russia's invasion of the country, quickly becoming a critical tool for both civilian and military connectivity.While Ukrainian and international officials praised Starlink's role in the war-torn country, its use in the conflict also raised questions about the influence a single private company could wield over access to internet services during wartime.These concerns escalated in September 2023 when a biography on Musk revealed that he had previously denied a Ukrainian request to activate Starlink coverage over Russian-annexed Crimea, effectively thwarting a planned drone submarine attack.This disclosure prompted the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to probe \"serious national liability issues\" stemming from a private citizen's sway over the conflict.However, in June 2023, the U.S. Department of Defense brought Starlink's activities in Ukraine under its formal oversight through a contract with SpaceX, effectively making the company an official military contractor.The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment regarding potential involvement or oversight of Starlink's operations in Venezuela. Beyond conflict zones, Starlink has also been used to bypass government-imposed internet censorship and shutdowns in several countries.In Iran, thousands of users have reportedly used Starlink to access the unfiltered internet, defying government restrictions despite the service not being officially approved.Venezuela also has a well-documented history of internet censorship and shutdowns, especially during times of political upheaval under the governments of Hugo Chávez and Maduro. \"Starlink allows internet to be provided by non-state companies in authoritarian regimes,\" Marko Papic, Global GeoMacro Strategist at BCA Research,  told CNBC, adding that this is almost certain to become a trend. \"It is highly likely that Starlink will become available, for free, everywhere where the U.S. is involved in an antagonistic relationship with the regime,\" he said. Starlink did not disclose how many users it had in Venezuela as of Sunday, nor the costs it might incur to provide the service.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Trump administration is facing renewed questions over its recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and charged him with crimes related to drug trafficking.  Hernandez in 2024 was convicted of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Hernandez in November, saying in a post to his Truth Social account that he had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, along with four other charges: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday was pressed on the apparent contradiction of Hernandez' pardon now that the U.S. is seeking similar charges against Maduro, another head of state of a South American nation with ties to the drug trade. \"I don't do the pardon file, I'm not against it or for it, I didn't review the file, so I can't speak to you about the dynamics that led the president to make the decision that he made,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He reviewed the file, he went through the arguments in it and he felt that the former president of Honduras was treated very unfairly by the previous administration,\" Rubio said. Rubio said that \"whether you agree with that decision or not ... that doesn't mean you leave Maduro in place.\"\"The answer to that, whether you have a problem with it or not, is not to leave in play someone who has been indicted who hasn't even faced American justice yet,\" Rubio said. Trump's pardon of Hernandez was already under intense scrutiny before Maduro's ouster. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the \"hypocrisy underlying this decision is especially glaring.\"\"This same president recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, including conspiring with narcotics traffickers while in office,\" Warner said. \"Yet now, the administration claims that similar allegations justify the use of military force against another sovereign nation. You cannot credibly argue that drug trafficking charges demand invasion in one case, while issuing a pardon in another.\"At a press conference on Saturday after Maduro's capture, Trump was pressed on the pardon. He said Hernandez was \"persecuted very unfairly.\" \"He was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,\" Trump said, referring to his own criminal prosecutions for allegedly hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election after leaving office following his first term as president. Trump also cited his endorsement of Nasry Asfura, the president-elect of Honduras, as another reason for the pardon. \"He's also a party member of the man who won, so obviously the people liked what I did,\" Trump said. \"And one of the reasons that was done is because of the fact that the party in power felt very strongly that that man was treated very badly.\"Trump also gestured at Rubio and other members of his national security team when explaining why he issued the pardon. \"I went to a lot of the people standing behind me, and they felt that that man was persecuted and treated very badly,\" he said.

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland,\" Frederiksen said Sunday, in a statement. \"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" she said. The warning from Frederiksen comes after Trump was quoted by The Atlantic magazine, saying, \"We do need Greenland, absolutely.\"Trump ordered a military operation over the weekend that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. The pair has been brought to the U.S. on drug-related charges. The operation came after months of U.S. military buildup and threats against Venezuela, which the Trump administration claims is complicit in trafficking drugs to the U.S. The move to topple Maduro led to speculation that Trump's other territorial ambitions could be obtained by force. Katie Miller, the wife of top White House aide Stephen Miller, posted to X a map of Greenland covered with an American flag with the caption \"SOON,\" shortly after Maduro was captured. Trump has long mused about acquiring Greenland, the mineral-rich and self-governing territory of Denmark. Last month, he appointed Louisiana's GOP Gov. Jeff Landry special envoy to Greenland. Trump has also openly spoken about making Canada, an independent nation, the 51st state of the U.S.Greenland and Canada have both repeatedly rebuked Trump's advances.  ",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

The company has made roughly $1.4 trillion in headline compute and infrastructure commitments as it works with partners to stand up massive data center campuses and secure next-generation chips at a pace the industry has never seen.Anthropic's pitch is that there's another way through the race, one where disciplined spending, algorithmic efficiency, and smarter deployment can keep you at the frontier without trying to outbuild everyone else.\"I think what we have always aimed to do at Anthropic is be as judicious with the resources that we have while still operating in this space where it's just a lot of compute,\" Amodei told CNBC. \"Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years.\"watch nowDaniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, who is Anthropic's CEO and a Baidu and Google alumni, helped build the very worldview they're now betting against.Dario Amodei was among the researchers who helped popularize the scaling paradigm that has guided the modern model race. It is the strategy that increasing compute, data, model size, and capabilities tends to improve the model in a predictable way.That pattern has effectively become the financial bedrock of the AI arms race. It underwrites hyperscaler capital spending, justifies towering chip valuations, and keeps private markets willing to assign enormous prices to companies that are still spending heavily to reach profitability.But even as Anthropic has benefited from that logic, the company is trying to prove that the next phase of competition won't be decided only by who can afford the largest pre-training runs. Its strategy leans into higher-quality training data, post-training techniques that improve reasoning, and product choices designed to make models cheaper to run and easier to adopt at scale — the part of the AI business where the compute bill never stops.To be clear, Anthropic isn't operating on a shoestring. The company has roughly $100 billion in compute commitments, and expects those requirements to keep rising if it wants to stay at the frontier. \"The compute requirements for the future are very large,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"So our expectation is, yes, we will need more compute to be able to just stay at the frontier as we get bigger.\"Still, the company argues that the headline numbers flying around the sector are often not directly comparable — and that the industry's collective certainty about the \"right\" amount to spend is less solid than it sounds.\"A lot of the numbers that are thrown around are sort of not exactly apples to apples, because of just how the structure of some of these deals are kind of set up,\" she said, describing an environment where players feel pressure to commit early to secure hardware years down the line. The bigger truth, she added, is that even insiders who helped shape the scaling thesis have been surprised by how consistently performance and business growth have compounded.watch now\"We have continued to be surprised, even as the people who pioneered this belief in scaling laws,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"Something that I hear from my colleagues a lot is, the exponential continues until it doesn't. And every year we've been like, 'Well, this can't possibly be the case that things will continue on the exponential' — and then every year it has.\"That line captures both the optimism and the anxiety of today's buildout. If the exponential keeps holding, then the companies that lock up power, chips and sites early may look prescient. If it breaks — or if adoption lags behind the pace of capability — then the players that overcommitted could be left carrying years of fixed costs and long-lead-time infrastructure built for demand that never arrives.Daniela Amodei drew a distinction between the technology curve and the economic curve, an important nuance that tends to get conflated in the public debate. From a technological perspective, she said Anthropic doesn't see progress slowing down, based on what the company has observed so far. The more complicated question is how quickly businesses and consumers can integrate those capabilities into real workflows where procurement, change management, and human friction can slow even the best tool.\"Regardless of how good the technology is, it takes time for that to be used in a business or sort of personal context,\" she said. \"The real question to me is: How quickly can businesses in particular, but also individuals, leverage the technology?\"That enterprise emphasis is central to why Anthropic has become such a closely watched bellwether for the broader generative AI trade. The company has positioned itself as an enterprise-first model provider, with much of its revenue tied to other companies paying to plug Claude into workflows, products, and internal systems — usage that can be stickier than a consumer app, where churn can rise once the novelty fades.watch nowAnthropic said revenue has grown tenfold year over year for three straight years. And it has built a distribution footprint that's unusual in a market defined by fierce rivalry. The Claude model is available across the major cloud platforms, including through partners that are also building and selling competing models.Daniela Amodei framed that presence less as détente and more as a reflection of customer pull, with large enterprises wanting optionality across clouds, and cloud providers wanting to offer what their biggest customers are asking to buy.In practice, that multicloud posture is also a way to compete without making a single infrastructure bet. If OpenAI is attempting to anchor a vast buildout around bespoke campuses and dedicated capacity, Anthropic is trying to remain flexible, shifting where it runs based on cost, availability, and customer demand, while focusing internal energy on improving model efficiency and performance per unit of compute.As 2026 begins, the divide matters for another reason: Both companies are being pushed toward the discipline of public-market readiness while still operating in a private-market world where compute needs are growing faster than certainty.Anthropic and OpenAI have not announced IPO timelines, but both are making moves that look like preparation, adding finance, governance, forecasting, and an operating cadence that can withstand public scrutiny. At the same time, both are still raising fresh capital and striking ever-larger compute arrangements to fund the next leg of model development.That sets up a real test of strategy rather than rhetoric. If the market keeps funding scale, OpenAI's approach may remain the industry standard. If investors start demanding greater efficiency, Anthropic's \"do more with less\" posture could put them at an advantage.In that sense, Anthropic's contrarian bet isn't that scaling doesn't work. It's that scaling isn't the only lever that matters, and that the winner of the next phase may be the lab that can keep improving while spending in a way the real economy can sustain.\"The exponential continues until it doesn't,\" Daniela Amodei said. The question for 2026 is what happens to the AI arms race — and to the companies building it — if the industry's favorite curve finally stops behaving.WATCH: Anthropic, OpenAI rivalry goes globalwatch now",

    "body": "As news spread Saturday of President Donald Trump's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a split screen emerged in Congress: Republicans largely celebrated the military operation, while Democrats condemned the president's actions and questioned their legality. After months of pressure on Maduro, Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. had assisted in a \"large scale strike\" against the country and its leader, who was captured along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and is being brought to the U.S. \"Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,\" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a post to X on Saturday.The Constitution grants Congress primary authority to declare war. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 in response to the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to take military action unilaterally and requires the president to consult with Congress when troops are deployed.But lawmakers said the president did not seek approval and did not brief Congress on his plans.Trump is expected to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, MS NOW reported, citing two sources. Trump will reportedly make an appearance at the gathering and it is unclear how long he will stay, MS Now reported.The lawmakers had already been scheduled to meet at the center for a policy forum to discuss the agenda for the second half of the 119th Congress, according to an invitation obtained by MS NOW. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement, called the decision to take military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization \"reckless.\"\"The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela. Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,\" Schumer said.Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told MSNOW that he had \"no briefing or heads up. I received all information from the news media at this point.\" And Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those who cheered the capture of Maduro, but said Congress had not been given any forewarning.\"And that's probably one reason why it didn't leak over these four days,\" Cotton said, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" on Saturday. \"Congress isn't notified when the FBI is going to arrest a drug trafficker or cyber criminal here in the United States. Nor should Congress be notified when the executive branch is executing arrests on indicted persons.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.Trump seemed to shrug off concerns about the constitutionality of the attack during a call-in to \"Fox & Friends.\"\"The Democrats, maybe they'll take a shot... all they do is complain,\" Trump said. \"They should say, 'great job.' They shouldn't say, 'Oh gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years.\" The president also said that the attack originally had been planned for earlier in the week but was rescheduled due to weather. No U.S. soldiers were killed in the operation, he said.During a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said members of Congress were called immediately after the mission, which he said was \"largely a law enforcement function.\" Notifying members ahead of the action could have jeopardized the mission, he said.\"This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission... it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, 'Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,\" Rubio said. \"Congress has a tendency to leak. This would not be good. If they leaked... I think it would have been maybe a very different result,\" Trump said at the press conference. \"Congress will leak, and we don't want leakers,\" he continued.The Trump administration has ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government in recent months, alleging that Maduro is the head of a narco-terror organization. He recently ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that he had spoken \"in the last several hours\" with Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and that the White House was working to schedule briefings with members when Congress is back in session next week.\"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,\" Johnson said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the operation an \"important first step to bring [Maduro] to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" Neither Thune nor Johnson, through their offices, responded to requests for comment on whether Republican leaders had been briefed ahead of the attack.\"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune said.As news of the attack on Venezuela broke early Saturday, there was at least some Republican skepticism.\"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted to X.Hours later, and after a phone call with Rubio, Lee had changed his tune.\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee said in a subsequent post.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., the former Trump ally who had a falling-out with the president and is resigning from Congress on Jan. 5, was part of a small group within the GOP who questioned the attack. \"(W)hy is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I'm not endorsing Russia or China),\" Greene posted to X on Saturday.And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent foil to Trump, questioned the constitutionality of Trump's removal of Maduro.\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie posted to X.Democrats, meanwhile, called for more answers and questioned what might come next for Venezuela, where Maduro has ruled for more than a decade.\"Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.\"Secretary Rubio repeatedly denied to Congress that the Administration intended to force regime change in Venezuela. The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region,\" Himes continued.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday, also said Trump did not properly notify Congress of the military action. He questioned how many American troops would remain on the ground and who would run Venezuela now that Maduro has been deposed.\"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said. \"The House and Senate must be briefed immediately and compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"",

    "body": "The oil tanker \"Minerva Astra\" lies at anchor in Maracaibo, Venezuela, as protester with the Venezuelan flag approaches the vessel Dec. 17, 2002.Andrew Alvarez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe arrest of Nicolás Maduro has thrown one of the world's most politically fraught oil industries back into focus, forcing investors to reassess who controls Venezuela's crude resources and whether they can be meaningfully revived after decades of decline.For now, the answer may seem straightforward. \"Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-owned oil company, controls the majority of the oil production and reserves,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. American energy corporation Chevron operates in the country through its own production and a joint venture with PDVSA, while Russian and Chinese firms also participate through partnerships, though \"majority control is still with PDVSA,\" Lipow said. If Trump is successful in seeing a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government take shape in Venezuela, Chevron is best placed [to control Venezuelan oil] given the are already well positioned there.Saul KavonicMST FinancialVenezuela nationalized its oil industry in the 1970s, which led to the creation of PDVSA. Oil output peaked at about 3.5 million barrels per day in 1997, but has since plunged to an estimated 950,000 barrels per day, with around 550,000 barrels per day exported, data provided by Lipow Oil Associates showed.If a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government takes shape in Venezuela, Chevron would be \"best placed\" to expand its role, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial. European companies like Repsol and Eni could also benefit, given their existing positions in Venezuela, he said.What it means for global oilAny regime change could disrupt the commercial chain that keeps Venezuelan barrels flowing, industry experts warned.\"Since it is unclear at this time who is in charge in Venezuela, we might see exports completely halt as the buyers don't know to whom to send the money,\" said Lipow. He added that the latest round of U.S. sanctions on a shadow fleet of tankers has severely affected exports, forcing Venezuela to cut production.The shadow fleet refers to tankers that operate outside traditional shipping, insurance and regulatory systems to move crude from sanctioned countries. These vessels are commonly used to transport oil from nations such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, which face U.S. restrictions on energy exports.Lipow expects Chevron to continue exporting 150,000 barrels per day, limiting any immediate supply impact. Still, he said the broader uncertainty could add a short-term risk premium of about $3 per barrel.That bump would come against a market that many analysts see as adequately supplied, at least for now. \"The oil market currently is trending towards oversupply,\" Rapidan Energy Group's Bob McNally said, calling the immediate impact \"almost a nothing burger.\" Venezuela's longer-term importance lies in the type of oil it produces. The country's heavy, sour crude can be technically challenging to extract, but prized by complex refineries, particularly in the U.S. \"American refineries... love to slurp that gunky oil from Venezuela and Canada,\" McNally said.\"The real issues are, will the oil industry be able to get back into Venezuela and reverse two decades of dilapidation and neglect and get it back up?\"If a new government led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is installed very quickly, sanctions could ease and oil exports could initially rise as stored oil is used to generate revenue, Lipow said. However, a short-term surge could pressure prices, he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past one yearStill, any notion of a sustained recovery faces hard physical limits. \"The Venezuelan oil industry is in such a state of disrepair that even with a change in government, it is unlikely to see any material increase in oil production for years as substantial investments are required to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure,\" he noted.Similarly, RBC's Helima Croft warned that the path to recovery is long, citing Venezuela's \"decades-long decline under the Chávez and Maduro regimes.\" She said that oil executives contend it will cost at least $10 billion annually to turn the sector around, with \"a stable security environment\" an absolute prerequisite.\"All bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,\" she said.— CNBC's Chery Kang and Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

But concerns about President Donald Trump's trade war, skittish consumers and an oversupply of domestic seats brought U.S. airfare down and weighed on industry profits.\"It's the airline version of the K-shaped economy. Monetize the top of the K and minimize the shortfall at the bottom,\" said Robert Mann, who has worked at several airlines and is president of aviation consulting firm R.W. Mann & Co. Now, the leaders of the country's biggest airlines are putting even more focus on customers who will pay extra for their tickets in exchange for a little more space or other perks like earlier boarding and access to never-sufficient overhead bin space.The view into American Airlines first-class cabin on a Boeing 737.Leslie Josephs/CNBCThey still face continued problems, like a shortage of air traffic controllers and aging infrastructure. Despite billions of additional federal spending to fix some of the problems, major improvements will take years.Mann said airlines need to do more to improve reliability. U.S. carriers had a 77% on-time rate, according to the Department of Transportation, which defines on-time as arrival within 15 minutes of the schedule.\"When the flight is late or canceled, it doesn't matter if you're at the top of the K or the bottom of the K,\" he said.Here's how the next year is shaping up for the airline industry:Winners take (almost) allThrough the first nine months of the year, Delta and United Airlines accounted for nearly all of U.S. airline profits. It's an industry divide that's been brewing for years, further fueled by a surge in costs and shifting consumer tastes as wealthier travelers have increased their share of overall spending.While the economy has been resilient for the most part, any weakening in 2026 could have an outsize effect on more price-sensitive consumers and, therefore, airlines that are more exposed to coach-class domestic travel, like lower-cost carriers.Those airlines have been making moves of their own. JetBlue Airways, for example, has been shifting its focus to more profitable routes and premium seats. It plans to debut a domestic business class in mid-2026 with seats up at the front of the cabin that are roomier but not quite as elaborate as its top-tier lie-flat Mint suites. Stable faresAirfare will likely remain steady next year over 2025, according to an American Express Global Business Travel forecast in mid-November. Demand has rebounded after dropping during a record-long government shutdown, but it's not clear whether 2026 will be a blockbuster.Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC in December that the \"first quarter looks strong\" but that \"it's hard to say,\" whether it will be better than a year ago.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesWhither SpiritStruggling budget travel icon Spirit Airlines is in its second bankruptcy in less than a year after a court-blocked acquisition by JetBlue, an engine grounding, a surge in costs and other problems, raising questions about its ability to survive. Industry insiders and airline analysts have said the yellow-plane airline will have to make much bigger moves with this bankruptcy.\"We do not expect it to remain a standalone company this time next year, with a merger or Chapter 7 outcome likely to drive upside to our earnings forecast,\" said a Raymond James note on Dec. 19.watch nowAnalysts expect that merger partner would be Frontier Airlines, the fellow budget airline that has attempted to combine with Spirit repeatedly since 2022, but it's not clear whether the two sides will reach a deal. Spirit said earlier this month that it's in \"active negotiations\" for a stand-alone reorganization or a transaction. Frontier and Spirit declined to comment further. Southwest transformedSouthwest's preparing for a major change in 2026. The airline's decades-long cattle call will end on Jan. 27 when assigned seating begins. It's coming off a slew of changes it already put into place last year. It debuted extra legroom seats that command higher prices and started charging many customers to check bags for the first time, a service that brought in more than $7 billion for its U.S. rivals in 2024, the last full year of available data, according to the Transportation Department.The carrier's stock is the top gainer of U.S. passenger airlines. Southwest shares rose nearly 23% in 2025 compared with the NYSE Arca Airline Index's 5% advance, and beat out profit leaders Delta and United as well as the broader market.Investors have been bullish on the company's transformation to a more traditional, segmented airline, which has been sped along by a stake from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.American makeoverAmerican is expanding its lounges and launching a fleet of Airbus 321XLR planes in 2026 as it aims to catch up in the luxury travel boom. Free inflight Wi-Fi is also coming for loyalty program members starting in January, American said last spring.The airline already made more minor changes, like adding Lavazza coffee for all its passengers and Champagne Bollinger for its top-tier lounges and cabins, to uplift its brand as well, but it has a long path to reach Delta's and United's profitability.American Airlines and Delta planes on the tarmac at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJust before Christmas, American also announced that it will no longer award customers on its no-frills basic economy tickets with frequent flyer miles, following a similar move by Delta several years ago. American hasn't yet announced changes to its elite status requirements for 2027, but the carrier is under pressure because Delta and United have said they will hold status thresholds steady.The airline is also making some changes that aim to improve reliability, recently announcing it will increase so-called banks, or clusters of flights at its largest hub, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, from nine to 13.American also said it is testing out two electronic gates there, where passengers on narrow-body domestic flights scan their own boarding passes, in hopes of getting travelers on planes faster, and in September, it said it will remove bag sizers from gates.",

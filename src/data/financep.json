    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "watch nowFed Governor Stephen Miran on Friday suggested that surging demand for dollar-denominated stablecoins could help push U.S. interest rates lower.In a speech delivered for an audience of economists in New York, the central bank official and appointee of President Donald Trump said the flood of crypto tokens pegged to the dollar could tamp down what economists refer to as \"r-star,\" or the \"neutral\" rate of interest that neither pushes nor impedes growth.If that happens, he said, the Fed might need to lower its own policy rate to avoid unintentionally slowing the economy.\"Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,\" Miran said. \"Stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the United States, and this demand will continue growing.\"Citing prior research, Miran said stablecoin growth could push the Fed's benchmark rate down by 0.4 percentage point.During his short time on the Fed board, Miran has advocated aggressive rate cuts, in part because he thinks the neutral rate is considerably lower than most of his colleagues assume. His latest remarks extend that argument into the world of digital finance, suggesting that the rise of stablecoins could structurally lower borrowing costs for years to come.Previously, his arguments have been focused largely on moderating inflation and the importance of the Fed not impeding economic growth with higher rates. The stablecoin dissertation adds another wrinkle to the case for easier policy.\"Even relatively conservative estimates of stablecoin growth imply an increase in the net supply of loanable funds in the economy that pushes down\" the neutral rate, he said. If neutral is lower, he added, \"policy rates should also be lower than they would otherwise be to support a healthy economy. A failure of the central bank to cut rates in response to a reduction in [r-star] is contractionary.\"Miran is expected to leave the Fed in January, when the unexpired term he is filling runs out.",

    "description": "The administration of President Donald Trump is taking aim at state laws that ban the inclusion of medical debt on consumers' credit reports.In late O",
    "body": "The administration of President Donald Trump is taking aim at state laws that ban the inclusion of medical debt on consumers' credit reports.In late October, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released what's known as an interpretive rule, stating that laws prohibiting medical debt reporting in 15 states are preempted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.Though the move is not legally binding, it marks an abrupt about-face from CFPB guidance during former President Joe Biden's administration, which allowed states to make their own credit rules as long as they weren't \"inconsistent\" with the federal law. A state requiring each credit agency to provide consumers with two free credit reports per year, for instance, would not be at odds with the FCRA, which requires one.Consumer credit advocates are sounding the alarm. Millions of Americans are already facing the possibility of rising health-care premiums, a reality that could force more people into medical debt, says Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.Should medical debt protections fall, \"now we're going to make it even worse by ruining your credit record,\" Wu says. \"It's just insult to injury. It's rubbing salt in the wound.\"What's at stakeMedical debt is a major source of financial insecurity among U.S. consumers. Americans owed about $220 billion in medical debt, according to a 2024 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, with around 14 million people owing a debt of more than $1,000 and 3 million people owing more than $10,000.The three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debts below $500 in April 2023. For the 15 states that have taken things a step further by banning any medical debt on credit reports, the rationale is simple, say Wu: Adding the data to credit reports is unnecessarily punitive.The CFPB declined to comment on the reasoning behind the guidance. But the previous iteration of the agency spelled out why it says medical debt reporting hurts consumers.\"People who get sick shouldn't have their financial future upended,\" former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said earlier this year. Reporting the debt, he continued, \"has allowed debt collectors to abuse the credit reporting system to coerce people into paying medical bills they may not even owe.\"Essentially, allowing medical debt to appear on credit reports — whose related scores determine whether consumers can access credit or buy a home — puts the burden on consumers to navigate debt that is often sudden and difficult to understand.For proponents of including medical debt on credit reports, \"the argument is that the credit report is more accurate because there's more information, and you don't want to lend to someone who has a lot of medical debt,\" Wu says.But an April 2025 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that removing medical data from credit reports was \"unlikely to affect credit outcomes.\" That's generally because people who have high levels of medical debt often rack up other kinds of debt to pay for treatment, Wu says.\"If you really are financially struggling from your medical debts, if you started off with an even halfway decent credit score, the first thing that happens is your credit card balances run up,\" she says.In other words, credit issuers likely have all the information they need to determine your creditworthiness, simply by looking at your credit card usage, which makes up a huge part of your score. Adding medical debt to credit reports amounts to kicking consumers when they're down, says Wu.'It's up to judges, not the CFPB'Though the CFPB's interpretive rule is perhaps the first step on the administration's part to unravel medical debt reporting bans, the guidance itself isn't legally binding. Rather, those laws would have to be challenged in court, says Brad Lipton, a former general counsel for the CFPB whose name appears on the Biden-era guidance.\"It's ultimately up to judges, not the CFPB,\" he says. The recent guidance, just like the one it contradicts, are merely pieces of evidence for a judge to consider.In the meantime, the state bans \"haven't been super controversial,\" he says. The reason, he says, is that credit reporting of medical debt is not a big driver of payment of medical bills.\"If someone doesn't pay their medical debt, it's usually because they simply don't have the money,\" he says. \"The government and the system can torture them all they want, but you're just not going to get much money out of it. It's water from a stone.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

The company did not immediately respond to request for comment.On Wednesday, McDonald's reported earnings per share and revenue that came in below Wall Street expectations, but its same-store sales were a bright spot, posting positive growth across all segments.U.S. same-store sales increased more than anticipated, up 2.4%, thanks to a boost from the $2.99 Snack Wrap launch and the introduction of its Extra Value Meals, which Erlinger said drew week-to-week growth.\"While we maintained a positive comp guest count gap, overall [guest counts] continue to decline-- underscoring the need for disciplined pricing, value, and affordability,\" he wrote in the memo.Erlinger said the company has \"the right plan in place\" and said it was poised for a strong fourth quarter, including the benefit of annual comparisons to last year's E. coli outbreak that dented burger sales.\"We still need to keep our foot on the gas-- staying focused on the customer and what we can control,\" he said.CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts this week that the fast-food chain is seeing signs of a bifurcated consumer base among quick-service restaurants.He noted \"QSR traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double-digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years.\"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double-digits in the quarter. We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets, and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" he said.In a separate memo to global operators, Kempczinski said the brand will continue to focus on \"sharpening value leadership to meet evolving consumer expectations and increase traffic.\"He added McDonald's will be \"investing in high-potential menu categories-- especially Chicken and Beverages-- to stay competitive and drive growth.\"McDonald's is currently testing beverages in 500 restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado that draw on learnings from its now-shuttered beverage concept, CosMc's.watch now",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs. Musk said he was also considering working with U.S. chip company Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains that power almost all modern technologies, including everything from consumer electronics like smartphones to massive data centers, and demand for them has been surging amid the AI boom.Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity would reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.While Tesla doesn't yet manufacture its own microchips, the company has been designing custom chips for autonomous driving for several years.It is currently outsourcing production of its latest-generation \"AI5\" chip, which Musk said will be cheaper, power-efficient, and optimized for Tesla's AI software.The CEO also announced on Thursday that Tesla will begin producing its Cybercab — an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel — in April.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy who spoke anonymously because the talks were private confirmed to CNBC that the automaker has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is manufactured at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to media following a Q&amp;A at the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Shelby Tauber | ReutersOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday that the artificial intelligence startup is on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.The company has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. The staggering sum has raised questions from investors and others in the industry about where OpenAI will come up with the money.\"We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology,\" Altman wrote in a post on X. \"Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.\"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion, though it's still not profitable.In September, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that OpenAI was on track to generate $13 billion in revenue this year.Friar caught the attention of the Trump administration this week after she saying at at event that OpenAI is looking to create an ecosystem of banks, private equity and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its investments in cutting-edge chips. She clarified those comments late Wednesday, writing in a post on LinkedIn that OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments.\"I used the word 'backstop' and it muddied the point,\" Friar wrote. \"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.\"Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" He wrote in a post on X that if one frontier model company in the U.S. fails, another will take its place.Altman said Thursday that OpenAI does \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\" He said taxpayers should not bail out companies that make poor decisions, and that \"if we get it wrong, that's on us.\"\"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. \"But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.\"WATCH: Trump AI czar David Sacks says ‘no federal bailout for AI’ after OpenAI CFO’s commentswatch now",

The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

US President Donald Trump said he would be imposing tariffs on semiconductor imports \"very shortly\" but spare goods from companies like Apple Inc. that have pledged to boost their US investments. Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWill Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta projected that 10% of its overall sales in 2024, or about $16 billion, came from running online ads for scams and banned goods, according to a Thursday report from Reuters. Those kinds of ads included promotions for \"fraudulent e-commerce and investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products,\" according to the Reuters report, which was based on internal company documents. Those documents showed the company's attempts to measure the prevalence of fraudulent advertising on its apps like Facebook and Instagram. Meta brought in more than $164.5 billion in overall sales for 2024. Last week, the company said that third-quarter sales rose 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion and that it lifted the low end of its total expenses for the year by $2 billion as part of its massive investments into artificial intelligence.The Reuters report cited a December 2024 document that showed how Meta each year generates roughly $7 billion in annualized sales from so-called \"higher risk\" scam ads, which are promotions that are clearly deceptive. Each day, Meta shows users an estimated 15 billion of these higher risk scam ads, the Reuters report said, citing a separate document.Although some of the documents show that Meta aims to reduce the amount of bogus ads on its platform, the Reuters report also said that other documents suggest the company is concerned that its business projections could be impacted by any abrupt removal of the fraudulent promotions.A Meta spokesperson said that the company \"aggressively\" addresses scam and fraud ads on its apps. The projections that 10% of the company's 2024 ad sales came from bunk ads \"was a rough and overly-inclusive estimate rather than a definitive or final figure; in fact, subsequent review revealed that many of these ads weren't violating at all,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\"Unfortunately, the leaked documents present a selective view that distorts Meta's approach to fraud and scams by focusing on our efforts to assess the scale of the challenge, not the full range of actions we have taken to address the problem,\" the spokesperson said.WATCH: Wall Street backs AI winners, and Meta's not one of them this quarter.watch now",

Smaller retail traders have gotten involved in the stocks with the VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF up 60% this year.The Defense Department in July took an equity stake in MP, set a price floor for the company, and inked an offtake agreement with the rare earth miner and magnet maker in an effort to roll back China's dominance of the industry.CEO James Litinsky said he didn't want \"people to get burned\" amid the speculation. Litinsky cautioned investors \"to just be very clear-eyed about what the actual structural economics are amidst all the excitement.\"\"The vast majority of projects being promoted today simply will not work at virtually any price,\" Litinksy said on the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday evening.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconVanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF, YTDMP views itself as \"America's national champion,\" Litinsky said.

The government investing in a dozens of sites and businesses wouldn't necessarily set up a supply chain, he said.The Trump administration should continue to encourage private capital to flow into the industry through loans, grants and other support, Litinsky said. There is room for \"a lot of other players and supply\" but the market will require \"materially higher prices\" for the industry's structural challenges to change, he said.\"If X dollars of capital can stimulate two or three X in private capital, they should be doing that as much as possible,\" Litinsky said.The CEO indicated that he views MP as a forerunner that will help create the conditions for a broader market that is not dependent on China over time.\"In the very short term the administration has made sure that we have a successful national champion in MP,\" Litinsky said. \"We are going to sort of pave the path if you will to then figure out how there's much broader supply coming online.\"Rare earths are crucial for making magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles, clean energy technology and consumer electronics. Beijing dominates the global supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on China for imports.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that could mark a turning point in how many people can access their costly blockbuster obesity drugs. Under the agreements, Medicare will start covering GLP-1s for obesity for certain patients for the first time beginning in mid-2026 – a shift that will open access to millions of older adults and could spur more employers and other private insurers to follow suit, some experts said. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also lowering the prices that all state Medicaid programs will pay for GLP-1s, but it's up to states to opt into coverage. Obesity drug coverage among state Medicaid plans, employers and other private insurers remains spotty due to the $1,000 or more monthly list prices of existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy. The limited insurance coverage has blocked out patients who can't afford their hefty price tags. That lack of access has led to mounting pressure on health plans and the government to expand coverage — and the government agreements with drugmakers could mark a major shift.\"I think it'll start with the government, start with Medicare, and the insurers will quickly follow,\" Nick Fabrizio, an associate teaching professor in Cornell's health policy program, told CNBC. \"I do think that's coming.\"\"This is a great step towards trying to address a chronic and serious issue, and for those patients who may feel like they have no hope,\" he said.Roughly 8 to 9 million people in the U.S. are using GLP-1s, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at a briefing with reporters on Thursday. The added Medicare coverage under the deal could bring in as many as 40 million new eligible patients, and prompt more commercial plans to cover the medicines, he said.The deals could also address the inability of many patients with limited or no insurance coverage for obesity drugs to access them, by offering the treatments at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx.gov. The monthly out-of-pocket cost of existing injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has. Still, there is a law prohibiting Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, so any changes would have to come from Congress. Eli Lilly's Ricks told reporters Thursday that for now, the government will launch an initial pilot program in the spring of 2026 under a temporary legal mechanism. It would be voluntary for Medicare prescription drug plans, so \"it may be possible that a few plans do not participate, but I would expect almost all do,\" he said. But Ricks said that it will transition into a formal so-called Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation pilot program in 2027, which means it will be mandatory for all Medicare Part D plans.\"So we expect broad coverage in all plans both in 2026 and beyond,\" he said.Medicare coverage could be a sea changeLikely the most notable feature of the deals is Medicare coverage of obesity drugs, as it will allow the treatments to reach new patients in the program and could lead to broader private insurance coverage. Under the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed to cut the price Medicare and Medicaid pay for GLP-1s to $245 per month. In Medicare specifically, certain patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. People who qualify include patients with a body mass index of 27 or above with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease; people with a BMI of 30 or more with related health conditions; or those with severe obesity, or a BMI of 35 and above. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. In a note Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger also said it's unclear whether the government will allow patients to stay on a GLP-1 for obesity after their BMI levels drop. Even with those restrictions, \"I think in practice, it's still going to cover a fair number of people,\" said Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the eligibility criteria mean 80% of the obese population in Medicare could receive coverage for GLP-1s, despite the limits.\"Today's deal will open up meaningful access to obesity drugs,\" Schott said in a note about Eli Lilly on Thursday. Lakdawalla added that while there isn't clear evidence that private insurers will expand coverage on the heels of government plans, \"it's just optically harder for them to continue to constrain coverage when Medicare and Medicaid are covering them.\" \"That's going to exert some pressure for commercial coverage of these drugs to expand as well,\" Lakdawalla said. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly, but remains sparse: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Medicaid, direct-to-consumer offerings could fill gapsLakdawalla said the direct-to-consumer offerings under the deal could be useful for people who are underinsured, uninsured or may not have coverage for obesity medicines. Still, it's unclear how many more patients the drugs will reach due to the offerings. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have introduced lower cost options for their drugs for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump will give those patients even bigger discounts.On TrumpRx, the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior Trump administration officials. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both offered some GLP-1s on their direct-to-consumer platforms for up to $450 to $500 per month.Starting doses of obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — expected to hit the market next year — will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid.  Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.In terms of Medicaid, Cornell's Fabrizio said states will likely want to start covering obesity drugs at the lower price point, \"but the question is how will they pay for it?\"Around a dozen state Medicaid programs cover obesity drugs, according to 2024 estimates from KFF, a health policy research organization. While GLP-1s offer substantial health benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries, state programs are already facing constrained budgets and administrative demands.Fabrizio added that raising taxes to cover the drugs \"could be a sticky issue.\"Still, JPMorgan's Schott said offering lower prices to Medicaid programs could lead to a \"significant increase in coverage\" in that channel, where Zepbound has very limited uptake. ",

Brian Snyder | ReutersVenture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\"\"The U.S. has at least 5 major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place,\" Sacks wrote in a post on X.Sacks' comments came after OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said Wednesday that the startup wants to establish an ecosystem of private equity, banks and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its infrastructure investments.She softened her stance later in a LinkedIn post and said OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments. She said her use of the word \"backstop\" clouded her point.\"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part,\" Friar wrote.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. OpenAI directed CNBC to Friar's LinkedIn post.Sacks said the Trump administration does want to make permitting and power generation easier, and that the goal is to facilitate rapid infrastructure buildouts without raising residential electricity rates.\"To give benefit of the doubt, I don't think anyone was actually asking for a bailout.

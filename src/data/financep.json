    "body": "<div><p>A pedestrian walk by sign is posted in front of Levi Strauss headquarters on Oct. 9, 2025 in San Francisco, California. </p><p>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEVI/\">Levi Strauss</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s profits are growing more than Wall Street expected despite higher costs from tariffs, thanks to targeted price increases and a shift away from wholesalers, the company said Thursday as it reported fiscal third quarter results. </p><p>During the quarter, Levi's gross margin grew 1.1 percentage points to 61.7%, up from 60.6% in the year-ago period and better than the 60.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. </p><p>In an interview with CNBC, CEO Michelle Gass said the company has started to raise the price of some of its jeans and clothes and will hike more prices in the U.S. and other markets next year.</p><p>\"As we've been taking these targeted actions, we've not seen an impact to demand. We'll of course, stay very, very close to that but … we're taking a surgical, thoughtful approach on any pricing,\" said Gass. \"We know that we're a brand that is known for great quality and value. We don't take that for granted. We know we have to earn that every day.\" </p><p>Finance chief Harmit Singh added demand is \"really strong\" and most of the company's revenue growth is not coming from price increases.</p><p>Price hikes are helping Levi's margins, but the company is also discounting less and selling more through its own website and stores instead of wholesalers, which comes at a higher margin. </p><p>The denim maker said its strong results led it to raise its full-year outlook, but added<strong> </strong>it's still taking a \"prudent\" and \"conservative\" look at the rest of the year as it navigates ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Singh said. </p><p>Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li>Earnings per share: 34 cents adjusted vs. 31 cents expected</li><li>Revenue: $1.54 billion vs. $1.50 billion expected</li></ul><p>Though Levi's posted better-than-expected results, shares dropped more than 6% in extended trading. Its stock had climbed about 42% this year through Thursday's close.</p><p>The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 31 was $218 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $20.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to impairment and restructuring charges, among other expenses, Levi posted adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share. </p><p>Sales rose to $1.54 billion, up 7% from $1.44 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Levi's is now expecting its full year sales to rise 3%, up from its prior guidance of between 1% and 2% growth, far exceeding expectations of a 2.9% decline, according to LSEG. </p><p>It's expecting its full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.27 and $1.32, up from a prior range of between $1.25 and $1.30. At the high end, the outlook is in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.31 per share, according to LSEG. </p><p>The jeans company said it's expecting its operating margin to be between 11.4% and 11.6%, which is also in line with expectations of 11.6%, according to StreetAccount. It's now expecting its gross margin to rise by 1 percentage point, which is the outlook Levi's delivered earlier this year before it factored tariffs into its forecast. At the time, its guidance didn't reflect any tariff impact. The following quarter, it cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points because of the new duties. </p><p>Now, Levi's is returning to that original outlook, as long as U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and rest-of-world duties stay at 20% for the remainder of the year. </p><p>Under the direction of Gass, Levi's has been working to grow its direct sales, expand beyond jeans and win over more female shoppers – strategies that helped the business grow both its top and bottom lines. </p><p>During the quarter, direct-to-consumer revenue, or sales from Levi's website and stores, grew 11%, driven by strength in the U.S. market, while women's was up 9%. Levi's is benefiting from strong momentum in the denim category, but the company is growing its assortment outside of just jeans, which gives it a hedge if fashion trends change.</p><p>Other types of clothes beyond denim bottoms, including tops, now make up nearly 40% of the business. The company's efforts to sell more tops is also resonating with consumers, as that category was up 9% during the quarter.</p></div>",

(Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)</p><p>Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>A major trading platform in the U.K. has issued a stark warning to investors hoping to cash in on relaxed crypto rules: cryptocurrencies should not be in your portfolio.</p><p>A longstanding U.K. ban on retail investors being able to access crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/06/uk-fca-to-lift-ban-on-crypto-etns.html\">was lifted</a> on Oct. 8. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments linked to one or more specified assets. In this case, they give traders exposure to digital tokens through the use of a regulated exchange.</p><p>The new rules sparked a warning from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/HL.-GB/\">Hargreaves Lansdowne</a><span><span></span></span></span> — the U.K.'s biggest retail investment platform — which urged British retail investors to be cautious.</p><p>\"The HL Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals,\" Hargreaves Lansdowne said in a statement.</p><p>\"Performance assumptions are not possible to analyse for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value.\"</p><p>When U.K. officials announced earlier this year that the ETN ban would be overturned, they argued the move would support \"the growth and competitiveness of the U.K.'s crypto industry.\" It was hailed by crypto firms as a major breakthrough for the sector in Britain.</p><p>The government also ruled on Wednesday that investors will be able to hold crypto ETNs in stocks and shares ISA accounts, an account where up to £20,000 ($26,753) a year can be invested tax-free.</p></div><h2><a></a>Big gains, and big losses</h2><p>Cryptocurrencies, which are decentralized and therefore not regulated by central authorities like governments, have their critics and prices are notoriously volatile. In 2022, a so-called \"crypto winter\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/crypto-peaked-in-nov-2021-investors-lost-more-than-2-trillion-since.html\">saw investors lose $2 trillion</a>. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=/\">Bitcoin</a><span><span></span></span></span> — the most commonly traded cryptocurrency — has led to major returns for early investors, however, and was last seen trading around $121,508.</p><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Bitcoin price</p></div><div><p>Still, Hargreaves Lansdowne urged investors to consider the risks attached to all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.</p><p>\"While longer-term returns of bitcoin have been positive, bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment — much riskier than stocks or bonds,\" the company said in its statement this week.</p><p>The firm said, however, that it recognized that some traders wished to \"speculate with cryptocurrency ETNs,\" and that it would therefore offer \"appropriate clients\" the opportunity to do so from early 2026.</p></div><h2><a></a>Institutional backing</h2><div><p>Cryptocurrencies have long divided market watchers, with some major institutions piling into digital assets while others have warned against them.</p><p>Last month, Morgan Stanley said it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/morgan-stanley-crypto-trading-e-trade-next-year.html\">close to offering crypto trading</a> to retail investors through its E-Trade division.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has also openly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/warren-buffett-cryptocurrency-has-no-value.html\">lashed out </a>at cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Chris Mellor, head of EMEA ETF equity product management at Invesco, told CNBC on Thursday that he believes digital assets can offer investors a hedge against volatility in more traditional asset classes.</p><p>\"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are sometimes considered 'digital gold' and questions have been raised around whether bitcoin might one day replace gold as the non-fiat asset of choice,\" he said via email. \"In our opinion, there is room for both in portfolios. With the caveat that correlations can change, in recent months we have observed that bitcoin has displayed a very low correlation with stocks, U.S. Treasuries and gold.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy DeVere Group, argued that bitcoin's recent climb past the $125,000 mark was a signal that digital assets have entered the financial mainstream.</p><p>\"Investors are no longer treating bitcoin as a curiosity at the edge of the market,\" he told CNBC. \"Volatility still exists, but it is now productive volatility, the kind that accompanies price discovery in a maturing market. Short-term swings are inevitable when capital rotates at this scale.\"</p><p>Green labeled this \"a structural realignment, not a temporary rally\" for bitcoin, and pointed to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/bitcoin-jumps-as-trump-is-set-to-sign-an-order-that-allows-cryptocurrencies-in-401ks.html\">Trump administration's favorable policy mix</a> as offering further support for its credibility.</p><p>\"The hands holding bitcoin have become stronger, more institutional, and more patient,\" he added. \"Bitcoin, for investors who take a strategic view, remains a solid, enduring investment.\"</p><p>— <em>CNBC's Ryan Browne and Hugh Son contributed to this article.</em></p></div></div>",

He concluded that \"on this basis, the president of the republic will appoint a prime minister within the next 48 hours.\"</p><p>But the most unexpected part came after. </p><p>While Lecornu didn't unveil details on the potential makeup of the new government, he made a suggestion: \"Whoever it is,\" they should be \"completely disconnected from the presidential ambitions for 2027.\"</p><p>\"The situation is already difficult enough. We need to have a team that ultimately decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country's problems until the presidential election,\" he added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Italian lessons</h2><div><p>Already on Monday, shortly after his resignation, Lecornu had deplored the \"resurgence of partisan appetites, sometimes not unrelated to the upcoming presidential election.\"</p><p>Would a technocratic government — selected on the basis of technical expertise, rather than a popular vote — perhaps fill the brief? </p></div><div><p>Outgoing French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu delivers a statement at the Hotel Matignon in Paris, on Oct. 6, 2025. </p><p>Stephane Mahe | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>This scenario could help pause the political crisis, which has seen France go through five prime ministers in less than two years.</p><p>It may also reassure investors and gain time until the 2027 presidential election — or at least until March 2026 when some suggest a parliamentary snap election could be held alongside an already scheduled nationwide mayoral election, in an attempt to solve the current deadlock in the National Assembly.</p><p>In Italy since the 1990s, central bankers have led multiple technocratic governments, Mario Draghi being the latest example.</p><p>In France, the name of François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France since 2015, keeps resurfacing as a rumored option for the most recent PM nominations.</p><p>It is difficult, however, to see how this would land with the French public opinion, which is deeply, and at times passionately, political. And with tough decisions needed to pass the 2026 budget and bring the country's deficit closer to 3% of GDP, this is perhaps one of the most political moments for the country in recent times.</p></div></div>",

Stripping out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, Pepsi's organic revenue increased 1.3% in the quarter.</p><p>However, the Frito-Lay and Gatorade owner is still seeing softer demand for its products. Pepsi's worldwide volume for both food and drinks fell 1% during the quarter. The metric strips out pricing and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p><p>CEO Ramon Laguarta said on the company's conference call that volume was also softer as Pepsi shifts to smaller packaging sizing to appeal to price-conscious consumers. While that shift hurts volume, it lifts revenue.</p><p>In particular, Pepsi has struggled in its home market in recent quarters, leading the company to invest back into its brands and to explore cost-cutting measures.</p><p>\"We also expect our North America business to deliver improved growth and profitability trends as we aggressively reduce costs, accelerate innovation and further sharpen our price pack architecture initiatives,\" executives said in prepared remarks.</p><p>Pepsi Foods North America, which includes brands like Doritos, Quaker Oats and Pearl Milling, reported that its volume fell 4% in the fiscal third quarter. The company has been investing in more \"permissible\" snack offerings, like Stacy's pita chips and Quaker rice cakes. It has more snack options on the way, like Doritos Protein, which aims to cash in on a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/09/restaurants-starbucks-smoothie-king-first-watch-protein.html\">consumer shift toward protein-rich foods</a>.</p><p>Pepsi also unveiled new packaging for Lay's potato chips that highlighted its lack of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/fda-announces-food-dye-ban.html\">artificial colors</a> and flavors, and pledged to launch Doritos and Cheetos \"NKD,\" which will not use synthetic dyes or flavors. Pepsi and other brands have moved to cut out those ingredients in part due to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/rfk-jr-pressures-pepsico-kraft-heinz-to-remove-artificial-dyes.html\">pressure from the Trump administration.</a></p><p>Likewise, Pepsi is planning to use more olive and avocado oils in its snacks; the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement has villainized canola oil and other seed oils, despite a lack of scientific evidence.</p><p>The company has also been trying to attract price-conscious consumers by making its multipacks and single-serving snacks cheaper.</p><p>Improving the performance of the North American food segment \"is a top priority for the business,\" executives said.</p><p>Pepsi's North American beverage unit saw volume shrink 3%, although Laguarta noted \"improved momentum\" in the business. The company's namesake soda grew both volume and revenue in the quarter, while new acquisition Poppi has seen its year-to-date retail sales climb more than 50% compared with the year-ago period, executives said.</p><p>In September, Pepsi divested its ownership of Rockstar Energy in the U.S. and Canada to rival energy drink maker <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CELH/\">Celsius</a><span><span></span></span></span>. The beverage giant owns an 11% stake in Celsius.</p><p>That same month, activist investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/06/elliotts-plan-for-pepsico-includes-investing-in-some-of-its-iconic-brands-shedding-others.html\">Elliott Investment Management unveiled</a> a $4 billion stake in Pepsi. In a presentation and letter sent to the company's board, Elliott pushed for a number of changes, including potentially refranchising its North American bottling network and reinvesting back into its soda brands. Laguarta said on the company's conference call that both Pepsi and Elliott share the belief that the company is undervalued.</p><p>\"We're going to have conversations in the coming weeks and months,\" Laguarta said.</p><p>The company also reiterated its full-year outlook. It still expects its core constant currency earnings per share to be roughly unchanged from the prior year and organic revenue to grow by a low single-digit percentage.</p><p>Pepsi <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pepsico-announces-new-chief-financial-officer-302579563.html\" target=\"_blank\">also announced</a> on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Jamie Caulfield plans to retire. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span> U.S. CFO Steve Schmitt will succeed him, effective Nov. 10.</p></div>",

Those projections represent growth of 10% year over year, an acceleration in gaming revenue gains.</p><p>For comparison, the state of Nevada booked a record $15.6 billion in gaming revenue in 2024, according to the <a href=\"https://www.americangaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nevada_Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">American Gaming Association</a>, citing Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p><p>But the government of Macao is intent on diversifying its economy and moving beyond its reputation as the gambling capital of the world.</p><p>When the six primary concessionaires, the companies that run licensed casino resorts in Macao, applied in 2022 to have those concessions renewed, the government extracted from them a commitment to invest nearly $15 billion over 10 years, with about 90% dedicated to non-gaming amenities.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WYNN/\">Wynn Resorts</a><span><span></span></span></span> CEO Craig Billings said in an email to CNBC that the company's concession-related investments are \"focused on entertainment and, as we have seen in many markets including Macau, entertainment is a clear driver of visitation.  And that visitation is from both gaming customers and non-gaming customers.\"</p></div><div><p>View of Macao, Macao.</p><p>Contessa Brewer | CNBC</p></div><div><p>At Wynn Palace in Cotai, customers might snap selfies in front of an incredible collection of F1 race cars, ride a gondola over a Bellagio-esque fountain show, or dine at SW Steakhouse while catching a different theatrical show every 30 minutes.

Golden Week alone, an eight-day holiday period ending October 8, was expected to bring in an estimated 1.2 million visitors.</p><p>And despite the strides in general entertainment, more visitors to Macao still means more gambling.</p><p>A JPMorgan analyst note published earlier this week said this year's Golden Week was likely to be Macao's best in five years, with the casinos projected to bring in $686 million in gaming revenue in just the first five days of the holiday.</p><p>CNBC was not allowed to photograph or record the casino floor, as its prohibited by law in Macao.

Macao's government collected $5.6 billion in gaming taxes in the first half of 2025, about 1% growth over 2024.

Roughly two-thirds of revenue now comes from non-gaming sources, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p><p>Of course, that's revenue; not profits. All those arenas, spas, pools and fancy theaters come with major construction and maintenance costs. And it takes a lot of high-priced concert tickets to pay off the investment.</p><p>Alan Woinski, publisher of The Gaming Industry Daily Report, blamed the slump in Las Vegas on declining tourist demand.</p><p>\"It is pretty easy to understand that leisure is where the LV Strip is seeing business plummet. Could we get back the billions wasted on non-gaming amenities to attract the non-gambling leisure customer?\" Woinski wrote on Wednesday.</p><p>Woinski says Macao is a different story: Here, the special events are driving the gambling.</p><p>\"This month will be a good test because usually after a Golden Week, the rest of the month is weak,\" Woinski told CNBC.</p><p>He said key metrics to watch are gross gaming revenue and whether the packed special events calendar for the rest of October helps deliver gaming revenue that finally returns to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>One top casino executive, who asked to remain unnamed for fear of retribution, said there was \"no way\" Macao would ever be majority non-gaming revenue. The amenities, then, may just icing on the Baccarat cake.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

But instead of using it as her second home, the indictment alleges, she rented it to a family of three.</p><p>The indictment alleges that James' alleged total purported \"ill-gotten gains\" were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan she received. Most of that money was from savings James allegedly received from a lower interest rate on the mortgage than she would have had to pay if the home was classified as a rental investment property, the indictment says.</p><p>\"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" said<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/new-york-state-attorney-general-indicted\" target=\"_blank\"> Halligan</a> in a statement after she obtained the indictment in Alexandria federal court.</p><p>\"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served,\" Halligan said.</p><p>James, in a statement, called the charges \"baseless\" and said, \"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.\"</p><p>\"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General.\"</p><p>Trump's \"own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,\" James said. \"The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.\"</p><p>\"His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me – and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president – is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country. This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.\"</p><p>James was ordered to make her first appearance in the case on Oct. 24 in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, Virginia. The case was assigned to Judge Jamar Walker, who was appointed to the bench in 2023 by then-President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/\">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>If convicted, James faces a maximum possible sentence of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million on each count. Any actual sentence would likely be much less severe given federal sentencing guidelines.</p><p>Halligan, on Sept. 25 obtained a criminal indictment against Comey, on charges related to his allegedly lying to Congress in 2020.</p><p>Halligan personally presented the evidence in Comey's case, reportedly after other prosecutors balked at the idea. It is highly unusual for a U.S. Attorney to present a case to a grand jury.</p><p>Comey pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Alexandria on Wednesday and was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5.</p><p>Halligan's predecessor as acting U.S. Attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned on Sept. 19, shortly after Trump said he wanted him gone.</p><p>Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that \"investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey,\" The New York Times reported on the day he resigned.</p><p>Trump promptly tapped Halligan to replace Siebert.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James.</p><p>\"New Yorkers know @NewYorkStateAG James for her integrity, her independence, and her relentless fight for justice,\" Hochul wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1976390804999721286\" target=\"_blank\">post on X.</a></p><p>\"What we're seeing today is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,\" the governor wrote.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said, \"This is what tyranny looks like.</p><p>\"President Trump is using the Justice Department as his personal attack dog, targeting Attorney General Tish James for the 'crime' of prosecuting him for fraud — and winning,\" Schumer said. \"One U.S. Attorney already refused this case. So, Trump hand-picked an unqualified hack that would go after another political enemy. This isn't justice. It's revenge. And it should horrify every American who believes no one is above the law.\"</p><p>James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James.</p><p>\"Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC,\" that report on Monday said.</p><p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, in April, made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records in connection with the Norfolk home.</p><p>James' lawyer, Abbe Lowell, in a statement Thursday to NBC News, said, \"Attorney General James flatly and forcefully denies these charges.\"</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,\" Lowell said. \"When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone – when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted -- it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law.\"</p><p>Pulte has made similar accusations about purported mortgage fraud against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.</p><p>Trump cited those claims in August when he tried to fire Cook, who, like James, is the first Black woman to hold her position. A federal district court judge blocked Trump from removing Cook while her lawsuit challenging her termination was pending.</p><p>The Supreme Court on Oct. 1 said Cook could remain in her post pending the outcome of oral arguments over the dispute, which are set for January. </p><p>Cook, who is being represented in her lawsuit by Lowell, has not been criminally charged.</p><p>In early September, James asked New York state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case.</p><p><em>\"</em>I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization,\" James said in her statement on Thursday.</p><p>\"We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence – not politics,\" she said. \"Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.\"</p><p>\"I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space,\" James said.</p><p>\"And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.\"</p></div>",

It was Ferrari's worst trading day since the automaker publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed down by 15% at $407.38 apiece, marking the stock's worst trading day since Ferrari listed in October 2015. The stock's largest single-day decline was previously 12.4% in February 2016.</p><p>The U.S.-listed shares, with a market cap of nearly $77 billion, are now down about 4% for the year.</p><p>Analysts at Citi said in a research note that Ferrari's guidance \"falls below our 'lower growth case' estimates from our CMD preview and reflects conservatism from management, we think.\"</p><p>They added, \"Given guidance, albeit conservative, implies limited operating leverage through the coming cycle we think there is some risk to both consensus EPS and multiples near-term.\"</p></div><div><p>A picture shows the entrance of the historic Ferrari factory in Maranello on February 18, 2025.   </p><p>Federico Scoppa | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>In a separate <a href=\"https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/ferrari-capital-markets-day-2030-strategic-plan\" target=\"_blank\">update</a>, Ferrari said it would target a 2030 sports car model lineup made up of 40% internal combustion engine, or ICE, cars, 40% hybrid and 20% fully electric vehicles.</p><p>Ferrari said the revised target, which is down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales by the end of the decade, is the result of a client-centric approach, the current environment and its expected evolution.</p><p>The pivot comes as the Italian carmaker lifted the hood on the technology set to power its maiden electric vehicle. Ferrari unveiled the production-ready chassis and powertrain of the \"elettrica\" during a technology and innovation workshop, saying it would start deliveries of the model in late 2026.</p><p>The completed car is expected to be launched at a global premiere next year.</p><p>\"With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing,\" John Elkann, executive chairman of Ferrari, said in a statement.</p></div><h2><a></a>Electric ambitions</h2><div><p>Several global carmakers have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/autos-car-giants-forced-to-confront-hard-truths-over-ev-transition.html\">scaled back their EV sales targets</a> in recent months, citing factors such a lack of affordable models, a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging points and intense competition from China.</p><p>Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/swedens-volvo-cars-scraps-plan-to-only-sell-electric-vehicles-by-2030.html\">abandoned</a> its heavily promoted plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying in September last year that it needed to be \"pragmatic and flexible\" amid changing market conditions.</p><p>Ferrari, which has seen its current number of active clients grow to 90,000, an increase of 20% compared with 2022, also said it planned to launch an average of four new cars per year between 2026 and 2030.</p><p>Analysts at JPMorgan were bullish following the announcements laid out in Ferrari's 2030 Strategic Plan.</p><p>\"We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,\" analysts at JPMorgan said Thursday in a research note.</p><p>\"We also estimate the company benefits from CEO Benedetto Vigna's leadership style, which has challenged the company to capitalise on collaboration to increase the speed at which it embraces innovation.

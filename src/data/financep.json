Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

    "body": "An employee works on a carbon fiber production line at Zhongfu Shenying in Lianyungang, China's eastern Jiangsu province on July 31, 2025.   Str | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity gathered speed in January, according to a private survey released Monday, as manufacturers accelerated production and front-loaded cargoes ahead of the extended Lunar New Year holiday. The seasonally-adjusted RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, conducted by S&P Global, rose to 50.3 in January from 50.1 the previous month, in line with analysts' expectations of 50.3 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates an expansion, while one below that suggests contraction. That marked the strongest level since October, when the private-surveyed PMI came in at 50.6.   Production accelerated last month as new orders picked up both at home and abroad, prompting firms to hire additional staff to cope with rising workloads and clear outstanding orders.    Total new orders expanded for the eighth straight month while new export orders rebounded, primarily buoyed by increased demand from overseas buyers, particularly Southeast Asia.    Business confidence, however, slipped to a nine-month low, as firms worried about rising costs, the private survey showed. Corporate expenses expanded at the fastest rate in four months, pushing factory-gate prices up for the first time since November 2024.  Metal prices, in particular, surged during the latest survey period, sending the input cost inflation to the highest since last September, the survey showed.  \"Looking ahead, if cost pressures persist while demand recovery is limited, profit margins will remain under pressure,\" said Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog. The reading was better than an official survey released on Saturday, which showed manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in January, coming in at 49.3, compared with 50.1 in the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The RatingDog private survey, which samples a smaller group of export-oriented manufacturers, has typically painted a brighter picture than the official polls that cover a broader range of firms.NBS officials attributed the slump to a seasonal slowdown and softer global demand. Local media reported that some factories halted production last month to allow their workers to return home ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year.  This year's Lunar New Year holiday has been extended to nine days for the first time, stretching from Feb. 15 to Feb. 23, as Beijing aims to boost domestic spending on travel, tourism, dine-out services and leisure activities during the holiday.   The pair of PMI data also provided an early glimpse of how the world's second-largest economy fared at the start of this year. China's economy hit the government's 5% growth target last year, underpinned by strong exports as manufacturers ramped up shipments to non-U.S. markets amid higher U.S. tariffs. Economists, however, have warned of persistent deflationary pressures, with retail sales weakening to the slowest pace in three years. Fixed-asset investment also recorded its first annual decline in decades, contracting 3.8% last year, as a deepening property slump and local governments' fiscal constraints curbed investment.    ",

Yasser Al-zayyat | Afp | Getty ImagesGold and silver extended their sell-off Monday, deepening losses from last Friday's rout as a firmer dollar and profit-taking drains momentum from a rally that had propelled the precious metals to record highs just days earlier.Spot gold lost around 5% to $4,611.4 per ounce, having crashed nearly 10% on Friday, when prices plunged below $5,000 an ounce. Silver, which had surged alongside gold on safe haven demand and speculative inflows, also remained under pressure after last Friday's 30% nosedive that saw the metal log its worst day since March 1980.Spot prices of the white metal were down more than 10% at $76.1138 per ounce as of 11.03 p.m. ET Wednesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold and silver extend sell-off after historic plungeAccording to analysts, the pullback followed a violent reversal on Friday, when optimism around U.S. interest-rate cuts collided with a sudden reassessment of Federal Reserve leadership after President Donald Trump nominated former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Chair Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.\"The 'Buy America' trade is back as a result, and the independence bid that drove gold and silver to nosebleed record heights right below $5,600 and $122 per ounce early Thursday morning is unraveling,\" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note on Monday.Christopher Forbes, head of Asia and the Middle East at CMC Markets, said gold's sharp retreat reflects a classic correction after an extraordinary rally rather than a breakdown in the longer-term bullish thesis.Gold's retreat is a \"classic air-pocket after an extraordinary run,\" Forbes said. \"Profit-taking, a firmer dollar, and fresh geopolitical headlines from Washington have knocked froth off a crowded trade.\"The dollar index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of currencies, has strengthened about 0.8% since Thursday.A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced gold less attractive for foreign buyers, while higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-paying yellow metal by making Treasurys more attractive as a safe haven.   Warsh has been an advocate of a tighter monetary policy, and his announcement as Fed chair has strengthened the dollar. At the same time, Trump's statements indicating a possible deal with Iran appear to have eased geopolitical concerns — WTI crude futures were down about 4% on Monday.In the near term, gold prices will remain elevated but volatile as markets await further clarity on Warsh's policy direction, Forbes said.Silver prices are still up around 16% since the start of the year, while gold prices are also about 8% higher year to date. Gold and silver both saw record-smashing rallies last year, surging about 65% and 145%, respectively.\"Renewed dollar weakness or confirmation of a dovish Warsh would bring dip-buyers back,\" said Forbes, who still maintains a bullish case for bullion in the longer 12 month horizon, adding that the metal can revisit recent highs, if the Fed continues easing while growth and inflation stay uneven.",

    "body": "If enacted, President Donald Trump's proposal for a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates could change many policies for borrowers. Among them: how issuers decide to value credit card points.  If you've accumulated any significant amount of credit card points, you should probably spend them now — but not because of the potential for a 10% interest rate cap, says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at The Points Guy.\"This is not a reason in and of itself to spend your points,\" Ewen says. \"Even before this was announced, you should be spending your points.\"Credit card points — rewards earned from card spend that can be redeemed for benefits like travel, cash back or merchandise — are funded mainly by fees paid by merchants on each transaction, along with interest and sometimes fees paid by cardholders, Ewen says.That means a 10% interest rate cap could reduce issuer revenue. To offset that lost income, reward programs may lower the amount of points you can earn from spending on the card, increase redemption costs or offer fewer perks, Ewen says.However, putting a timeline on when points could start to lose their value if an interest rate cap is implemented is a \"fool's errand,\" because of all the uncertainty around Trump's proposal, he says. Why you should spend your credit card points nowThere are two main reasons you should be consistently spending your points, Ewen says:Credit issuers can change their policiesPoints tend to lose value over timeHotel, airline and credit card reward programs can change their redemption policies at will, and they don't necessarily need to give you advance notice of any upcoming changes, Ewen says.\"You don't know what the future is going to hold,\" Ewen says. Stockpiling points \"can really come back to bite you if something changes significantly in the program that you are holding them in.\"Changes rarely increase the value you can redeem for your points, Ewen says. Whether it's beneficial redemption rates or options to transfer your points to airlines or hotel loyalty programs, if your credit card comes with a perk you have active plans to use, Ewen says it may be wise to take advantage now.Additionally, unlike money you put in a high-yield savings or investment account, your points don't earn interest. This means their real value erodes over time as prices rise — $100 worth of points with an airline will still be worth $100 next year, even if flight prices increase, Ewen says. \"The idea of using your points now keeps money in your pocket to be used in other situations,\" Ewen says. \"Sure, you can earn more through spending and other activities, but you're not going to see a balance increase just by leaving it there.\"How many points is too many points?The number of points you should keep on hand will vary by person, and it largely depends on how many opportunities you have to redeem them, Ewen says. It can be useful to have some points saved for emergency situations like last-minute flights, he adds.For those going on multiple domestic and international trips in a year, it may make sense to hold onto more points. Those who travel less frequently should start thinking about spending their points once they hit the mid to upper five-figure range, he says.It's very common to see people saving points for a big trip like a honeymoon, Ewen says. Keep in mind that points can often be redeemed months ahead of time, and if price drops happen, especially with flights, you may be able to rebook and receive the difference back in points, though you should check with your provider first, Ewen says.If you have points that can cover a flight right now, go ahead and spend your points on it, he says: \"That is going to be your best option.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Oil prices rose more than 1.5% in Asian trade on Thursday, on increasing concerns of a U.S military attack on Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.Anton Petrus | Moment | Getty ImagesOil prices slid Monday as investors dialed back fears of a supply shock after U.S. President Donald Trump's statements on Iran signaled a possible easing in tensions between Tehran and Washington.Trump has repeatedly warned Iran of a possible intervention if it failed to reach a nuclear deal or continued cracking down on domestic protests, which Tehran claims are fueled by the West. On Saturday, he told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with the U.S.His comments came after Iran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that preparations for negotiations were under way.Oil prices rose to a six-month high recently amid fears the United States could carry out a military strike against Iran. Washington last week deployed a \"massive Armada\" toward Iran, a move that raised fears of a confrontation with the Middle Eastern country.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past yearGlobal benchmark Brent fell as much as 6.4% to $66.15 a barrel on Monday, LSEG data showed, and was last 4.41% lower. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were 4.75% lower at $62.11 per barrel. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the renewed slide in prices follows reports that Washington and Tehran have been communicating through intermediaries, raising hopes that tensions could ease rather than spiral.\"The talks are happening at the same time Iran is threatening a regional war should they be attacked, which could lead to substantially higher oil prices, an outcome that the Trump Administration would like to avoid,\" he told CNBC.Marko Papic, BCA Research macro and geopolitical strategist, added that the U.S. administration's sensitivity to oil prices could act as a brake on further escalation. \"I do think that President Trump is concerned that if oil prices go up to, you know, $70-$80, he's going to get even further into a hole ahead of the midterms.\"The U.S. faces midterm elections later this year, and fuel prices have traditionally been a sensitive political issue for voters.Diplomatic feelers also come at a time when additional supply is quietly entering the market. Venezuelan crude, much of it drawn from offshore and onshore inventories rather than new production, is adding to available barrels, even as global oil production continues to exceed demand.Both experts said those flows are helping cap prices even as OPEC+ continues to manage output carefully.\"While additional quantities of Venezuelan oil are coming to market as offshore and on shore inventories are liquidated and sold, the oil market will also continue to be supported by OPEC+ decision to hold steady its current production levels,\" said Lipow.The oil cartel on Sunday decided to leave production levels unchanged for March, extending a three-month supply freeze.

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "For most of the past two decades, the majority of electric vehicle-related investments have gone to Republican-led districts, especially in the Southeast. With the industry pulling back from electric cars and trucks, the fate of those investments is now an open question. Automakers and battery makers invested more $200 billion in EV and battery manufacturing facilities in the U.S. from roughly 2000 to 2024, according to data and policy research firm Atlas Public Policy. About 84% of battery investments went to Republican-led districts, as well as 62% of EV manufacturing investments, the firm said. These were expected to create more than 200,000 jobs, 77% of which would be in Republican districts.Almost half of all that investment — 40% — went to the Southeastern U.S., according to Atlas. For more than half a century, the South has become a manufacturing hub for the automotive industry, but the EV push yielded some of the biggest investments in the history of the region.Then federal incentives for EVs enacted through the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act were stripped away, and sales fell short of expectations. The companies that can are pivoting to other types of vehicles or entirely different products to avoid losses and layoffs. Hyundai MetaplantThe Hyundai Metaplant is seen on Sept. 9, 2025, in Ellabell, Georgia.   Elijah Nouvelage | AFP | Getty ImagesHyundai Motor Group is one of the automakers making changes after an EV push.The group, which includes the Hyundai, Genesis and Kia brands, was for a time the No. 2 seller of EVs in the country after Tesla, according to José Muñoz, CEO of Hyundai Motor Company.But the end of federal incentives for EVs was immediately followed by a dramatic drop in sales. Overall, HMG's EV sales were growing in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, they had fallen 50%. \"We still do better than the industry,\" Munoz said, \"But it had an impact in the industry, which we could clearly see in the fourth quarter.\"Hyundai has long had a large factory in Montgomery, Alabama, but the company made an unprecedented bet on a $12.6 billion EV factory and joint battery ventures outside Savannah, Georgia, when it announced it in 2022.The Hyundai Metaplant, as it is called, was the largest investment in Georgia's history, taking the title from Rivian's $5 billion factory outside Atlanta. Hyundai estimated the plant would hire about 8,500 workers by 2031, with another 6,900 at nearby suppliers. As of January, the company had hired about 1,440. In 2024, Georgia led the nation in EV manufacturing investment, according to Atlas. Its Republican governor, Brian Kemp, had said he wanted to make the state the \"electric mobility capital\" of the United States. Hyundai's Metaplant factory was originally intended solely for EV production. The company actually sped up construction so its critically acclaimed — and, for an EV, strong-selling — Ioniq5 crossover would be eligible for the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. The Inflation Reduction Act required that EVs be assembled in the U.S. and have a minimum U.S. parts content to qualify. But the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" took those credits away, as of Sept. 30. As a result, Hyundai announced an additional $2.7 billion investment in Metaplant to increase production by 200,000 units, targeting an annual output of half a million cars. It is now planning a mix of 10 hybrids and EVs, and Munoz expects sales volumes will be about 30% EVs and 70% hybrid and gas. Write-downsHaig Partners managing director John Murphy has estimated that automakers in the U.S. will likely face at least $100 billion in write-downs on their EV investments, meaning those investments are unlikely to yield the expected profits — or any profits at all. \"It's the single biggest capital allocation mistake in the history of the automotive industry,\" Murphy said.It's already started. Ford said in December it will take a $19.5 billion charge on its EV business, which has not turned a profit, while crosstown rival General Motors said it will take a $7.6 billion charge. International automakers such as Honda, Porsche and Volvo have all warned investors of similar charges of at least a billion dollars. Muñoz told CNBC he does not expect Hyundai have write-downs. A key Hyundai strategy is flexibility — making 10 models in single plant — as it plans to do in Metaplant, or even 12 in its soon-to-open factory in Ulsan, South Korea, which has given it the ability to pivot as market conditions change. \"The more flexibility you have, the less issues you have with changes in the environment,\" he said. \"So I think, knock on wood, I don't think we're going to see these types of write-offs that we've seen with other competitors.\"EV sales forecasts are a fraction of what the industry was expecting just a few years ago. The Biden administration wanted 50% of new car sales to be EVs by 2030. \"That was the target,\" said Peter Tadros, president of North America powertrain solutions for Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier. \"Then, over the years, it dropped to 35, to 25, to 17. So now we're at 17% projection for 2030. So a huge, huge gap from the initial projection.\"Bosch had made a $250 million investment in its factory in Charleston, South Carolina, which included plans for an electric motors division. \"Now the investment was not made for 50% market, but it was not made also for 17%,\" Tadros said.That means the company has had to adjust. Bosch was able to move nearly all employees from the EV motors division to other departments. The factory also produces safety devices such as electronic stability control and fuel injection systems — which it expects to be in greater demand as the market pivots back to gas-burning vehicles. Still, the bet it made on EVs did \"cause some pain,\" Tadros said. \"You're stranded with this equipment, not producing as many as it should be producing to make up for this depreciation,\" Tadros said. \"So it's here. It's ready to go. We look forward to making a lot more motors in the future. But right now, it's a difficult situation for that segment.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

Trump | Via Truth SocialA government official and top royal from the United Arab Emirates purchased a $500 million stake in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture last year, months before the Trump administration greenlit the sale of advanced AI chips to the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — is the Gulf nation's national security adviser and manager of its largest wealth fund. Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company, took a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, according to the Journal. The deal would make Aryam the largest shareholder of World Liberty, and the company's only known investor besides the founders, the Journal reported.World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.The company counts President Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The deal, according to the Journal, was signed by Eric Trump in the days before his father's second inauguration as president. It came as Tahnoon was seeking access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S., which the Biden administration had blocked over concerns that the chips would end up in China. According to the Journal, the agreement saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities and $31 million to Witkoff family entities.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

The agreement called for a fifth of the chips to go to Tahnoon's own AI company, G42.The Journal report has prompted new scrutiny of the Trump administration's dealings with the UAE and Tahnoon, with some in Congress warning of potential conflicts of interest or corruption. \"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"The Trump Administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.\"Warren called on Witkoff, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"testify in front of Congress on mounting evidence that they sold out American national security in order to benefit the President's crypto company — and about whether any officials lined their own pockets in the process.\"White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the Journal that \"[t]here are no conflicts of interest.\" She added that Witkoff is working to \"advance President Trump's goals of peace around the world.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also defended the president on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\"I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn't do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office,\" Blanche said, without providing evidence. Republicans and Trump have long accused the Biden family of corruption over the former President Joe Biden's family's business dealings abroad. Though an impeachment inquiry was launched in the House over the matter, evidence of wrongdoing by Biden never materialized. \"I don't have a comment on it beyond President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons,\" Blanche said. \"This idea that there's something untoward or unprecedented is just a repeated story that isn't true.\"Read the complete Wall Street Journal story here.",

    "body": "Amber Casino and former scam center, owned by Chen Zhi, a Chinese businessman who was deported to China, is seen in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on Jan. 18, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesChinese-language money laundering networks funneled an estimated $16.1 billion in illicit funds through cryptocurrency transactions in 2025, according to a report released Tuesday by blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis.These networks, known as CLMNs, accounted for roughly one-fifth of the illicit cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2025, which Chainalysis valued at over $82 billion.The criminal networks primarily operate through various channels and chat groups on the messaging platform Telegram, where launderers advertise their services to prospective customers. These postings often include pictures showing heaps of cash and public testimonials as proof of liquidity and service quality, according to the report.These Telegram-based channels, known as \"guarantee\" platforms, function as marketing hubs or informal escrow services that connect vendors with prospective clients. While the platforms do not control the underlying transactions, Chainalysis said they are the main conduits through which illicit deals are arranged.Beyond money laundering, activity on these platforms includes other forms of criminal trade, such as human trafficking and the sale of Starlink dishes used in Southeast Asian scam centers, according to Andrew Fierman, Head of National Security Intelligence at Chainalysis.These are very large, well resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat.Mark ButtonCriminology professor at the University of PortsmouthProspective clients also range from organized crime syndicates to sanctioned state actors, Fierman said.\"We have seen everything from North Korean money and DPRK-related hacks going through, to a whole host of other illicit activity,\" Fierman told CNBC.Such Telegram-based platforms are common mediums for illicit networks worldwide, according to Mark Button, a criminology professor at the University of Portsmouth, who has studied similar networks in India and West Africa.The report identified six main techniques used by Chinese-language money laundering networks to launder funds, often relying on digital assets such as cryptocurrencies to move funds discreetly.According to Fierman, cryptocurrencies appeal to criminal actors because of their liquidity, ease and relative anonymity, particularly for those seeking to avoid having their funds frozen on traditional financial platforms.Stablecoins such as USDT, issued by Tether, and Circle's USDC, are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, often a fiat currency like the U.S. Dollar. Their lower volatility compared with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum helps keep transaction costs down.\"If you are involved in illicit activity, the last thing you want to be doing is losing more money,\" Fierman said. \"You already have to pay money for the laundering process... the last thing you want is for there to be a really bad week on Bitcoin and lose another 10% of your money.\"Casinos, crypto and crimeMany organized crime groups that use crypto-based laundering services often also move funds through legitimate-looking enterprises, Button said.\"Casinos are a classic means to launder any criminal proceeds,\" he said, adding that it is common practice for criminal groups to launder illicit funds through inflated revenue figures.Since at least 2022, Southeast Asia has begun emerging as a hub for licensed and unlicensed casinos with links to organized crime, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.While the Chainalysis study examined organized networks that use Mandarin as their primary communication medium, many transactions also originate from outside China, Fierman noted. These include places such as Cambodia and Myanmar, where organized crime syndicates have been found to run elaborate scam centers.\"China has actually been very good at cracking down on these kinds of scams, because they generally don't like organized crime,\" Button said.On Thursday, China's state media Xinhua reported that 11 members of a Myanmar-based scam syndicate were executed on charges of \"intentional homicide, intentional injury, unlawful detention, fraud and casino establishment\".China has strict laws on money laundering and has banned cryptocurrency trading since 2021, citing its use in organized crime.As a result, Chinese criminal groups often relocate to jurisdictions in Southeast Asia like Cambodia and Myanmar, where weaker legislation and corrupted local officials allow them to operate more freely, according to Button.While authorities have proactively sought to clamp down on these transnational crime syndicates, enforcement has been challenging due to the sophistication of their operations and the complexity of cross-border enforcement.\"These are very large, well-resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat,\" Button said.Chainalysis estimated that these Chinese-language money laundering networks laundered the equivalent of $44 million per day in 2025.Despite efforts to clamp down on such illicit trade, Fierman said many of these networks are likely to continue evading capture. \"This is how illicit actors operate. They evolve, and once one gets detected, they hop to another avenue\".",

A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates an expansion, while one below that suggests contraction.That marked the strongest level since October, when the private-surveyed PMI came in at 50.6.Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.13%, while the Topix added 0.52%.

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

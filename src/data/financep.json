    "body": "watch nowInvestor Matt Shumer ignited a firestorm on social media this week with an essay that warned about the disruptive potential of AI. More than 80 million views later, he said it \"wasn't meant to scare people.\"\"I want to be very clear about this, the article wasn't meant to scare people in this way,\" Shumer told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday. \"If I had known how viral this was going to go, I would have thought about certain parts and rewritten some of the parts for sure.\"The essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" details Shumer's recent experiences using artificial intelligence. In it, he argues that AI's capabilities are under appreciated by the wider public. He compared the state of AI to the rumblings during early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, right before the number of cases soared in the U.S.OpenAI rocketed into mainstream with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and the company kicked off a high-stakes race for dominance among rivals like Google and Anthropic. Investors have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, and Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion on capital expenditures this year alone.He wrote that he's been \"shocked\" to discover that AI can perform all of the actual technical work of his job, and Shumer said professionals across fields like law, finance, medicine and accounting, among others, will begin to share similar experiences. Shumer published the essay on Tuesday. Since then, it has racked up more than 100,000 likes and nearly 6,000 comments, according to X. The essay prompted a range of praise and criticism from readers. In retrospect, Shumer said he would have liked to have framed some parts differently. Even so, Shumer reiterated his belief that AI could be disruptive to many knowledge workers. He said its \"clear\" that AI will be able to do anything that can be done on a computer, though he said it doesn't necessarily mean that it will immediately be adopted or proliferate through society. Shumer said the \"core message\" he is trying to convey is that people in the workforce should start to use and experiment with AI tools so they can understand what's coming. \"Everybody likes to think their thing is special,\" Shumer said. \"I thought my thing was special for a while.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright speak with the media after attending a meeting, marking the highest-level U.S. visit focused on energy policy to the OPEC nation in nearly three decades, as Washington conducts its first on-the-ground assessment of the oil industry it aims to help rebuild, in Caracas, Venezuela, Feb. 11, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersVenezuela oil revenue will no longer be deposited in an account in Qatar, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told NBC News in an interview this week. \"An account was set up in Qatar, controlled by the U.S. government the whole time, to land that money in and then send the money from there down to Venezuela,\" Wright told NBC News on Thursday. \"Now we have an account at the U.S. Treasury. The money won't go to Qatar anymore,\" the energy secretary said.The Trump administration has taken control of Venezuela's oil sales after capturing former President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid last month. Wright met Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in Venezuela this week, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country in decades. Wright told NBC News that revenue from Venezuelan oil sales now tops $1 billion. The U.S. has short-term agreements to sell another $5 billion of the country's crude over the next few months, he said. The oil has gone to U.S. refineries and Europe so far, he said. The U.S. deposited the initial $500 million of oil sales in the Qatar account before transferring the funds back to Venezuela, Wright said. Democrats in Congress have questioned the transparency and legality of the arrangement. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced legislation Thursday that directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent audit of the Qatar account.  watch nowWright said the U.S. deposited the initial sales in Qatar because the funds face the risk of Venezuela's creditors attempting to claim them. Caracas faces tens of billions of dollars in outstanding claims from defaulting on its sovereign debt and nationalizing the assets of oil companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. \"Since Venezuela has so many creditors and they owe a lot of money, we had some risk if we put it into a U.S. bank account set up quickly that creditors could freeze that money,\" Wright said. \"We want those creditors ultimately to get their money back, but that money urgently needs to get to Venezuela.\"The U.S. faces the added complication that it does not officially recognize the government led by Rodríguez. President Donald Trump recognized the 2015 opposition-led National Assembly during his first term in 2019. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 28 that Washington must find a way to resolve the issue of government recognition for the funds to be deposited in the U.S.\"You have to recognize a government, but we don't recognize this government,\" Rubio said. \"We recognize the 2015 National Assembly, so we have to find some creative way legally to meet that standard.\"Venezuelan oil revenue deposited in the U.S. should in theory be under the control of the opposition National Assembly due to Trump's recognition, said Scott Anderson, an international law expert who previously served with the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under President Barack Obama.This raises the question of which government the U.S. will ultimately recognize and when. Wright told NBC that elections and a transition of power will likely happen in Venezuela during Trump's term. He said U.S. government oversight of Venezuela's domestic affairs would conclude at that point. \"It is a question of a process to get there,\" Wright said. \"Ultimately, what the long-term political leadership in Venezuela is going to be, it's going to be up to Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "watch nowTop Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler said Thursday night that she will leave the investment bank at the end of June, a decision that came after a flurry of news articles highlighting documents detailing the former White House counsel's often chummy email conversations with the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Goldman, for months, has defended Ruemmler after Congress and then the Department of Justice released emails between her and Epstein, as well as other documents related to investigations of him. Ruemmler, who has been a key advisor to Goldman CEO David Solomon since joining the bank in 2020, told the Financial Times on Thursday, \"I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction.\"The FT first reported the 54-year-old's decision to leave Goldman, where she has been general counsel and chief legal officer, at the beginning of the summer.Solomon, in an interview on Friday with CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" called Ruemmler \"a tremendous human being.\"\"She called me yesterday afternoon and told me that ... the press coverage of the work that she had done previously and of this whole situation had just gotten to a level of noise and distraction that she thought was distracting the firm,\" Solomon said. \"It was putting her in a position where it was hard for her to execute on her job and her responsibilities, and she just thought it was time to step away.\"Ruemmler, in a statement Thursday night to CNBC, said, \"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do.\"\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler said.\"Earlier today, I regretfully informed David Solomon of my intention to step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.\"Solomon, in a statement Thusday, said, \"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm.\"\"As one of the most  accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision,\" Solomon said.Her announcement that she will leave Goldman comes nearly a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people whom Epstein called on July 6, 2019, after being arrested by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges at an airport in New Jersey. The Journal's report cites a handwritten set of notes by law enforcement about comments Epstein made inside an FBI vehicle after his arrest.Those notes are among documents released in late January by the Department of Justice, CNBC has confirmed.Other news articles detailed emails and documents showing how Epstein had made gifts to Ruemmler that included a Hermes bag, and other luxury items, such as a Fendi purse, spa visits, Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and flowers. On one occasion, she effusively thanked him, calling him \"Uncle Jeffrey,\" one email showed.Ruemmler was a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins during the years she was speaking with Epstein, whom she met in 2014.An Aug. 14, 2014, email contained in the DOJ's Epstein files shows how he asked her to represent his client, Bank Edmond de Rothschild.\"They have a justice department problem ... like every other swiss bank,\" Epstein wrote her.Ruemmler took the bank as a client for Latham.Ruemmler has said that she never represented Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail weeks after his 2019 arrest.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinRuemmler's spokeswoman, Jennifer Connelly, told the Journal for its story last Friday, \"These documents are consistent with what Ms. Ruemmler has repeatedly said: She knew Epstein when she was a criminal defense attorney and shared a client with him.\"\"She was friendly with him in that context. She had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part,\" Connelly said.Ruemmler previously served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.She is the latest person to lose a high-profile position because of her prior association with Epstein.On Sunday, Morgan Sweeney resigned as chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. Starmer fired Mandelson from that post in September over disclosures about his connection to Epstein.Last week, Brad Karp, chairman of the major corporate law firm Paul Weiss, resigned from that post after fallout over emails between him and Epstein. Karp is staying at the firm.In response to the Epstein emails, a Paul Weiss spokesman previously said, \"Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"Karp said he was leaving the chairman's post because of the distraction of the news stories.In November, after a congressional committee released emails between Ruemmler and Epstein, Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto told CNBC, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said at the time.Ruemmler has previously told the Journal that she regrets ever knowing Epstein.Among the new tranche of emails that the DOJ released in late January is one that Ruemmler sent Epstein in March 2019, four months before his arrest.In that email, she offered advice on how to respond to criticism that he had previously received special treatment and a light punishment in 2008 because of his wealth and political connections when he avoided federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. At the time Epstein sought Ruemmler's advice, he had been the subject of a series of articles in the Miami Herald that were critical of the decision by federal prosecutors not to file charges against him in 2008. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in state prison in Florida, but was allowed out to go to his office during the day for much of that time.The subject line of the email thread, \"From wapo,\" suggests that Epstein was reaching out to Ruemmler because of an inquiry by The Washington Post about him.Ruemmler wrote in the email: \"Something like: … 'The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental [misunderstanding] of both the facts underlying Mr. Epstein's case and how it was [prosecuted] by both local and federal authorities.\"\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offenses] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote. \"He accepted responsibility, served [time and] prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims [involved].\"Ruemmler, in a bracketed section, also suggested saying something like, \"But for his wealth, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Epstein … would have received the aggressive treatment that he did from [federal] prosecutors, and he certainly would never have been subjected to the [salacious] and malicious treatment by the media that he continues to receive more than 10 years after the case was resolved.\"",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI, which merged with SpaceX last week, is facing increased pressure from environmental and civil rights groups over pollution concerns, this time at the company's facility in Southaven, Mississippi. On Friday, the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, on behalf of the NAACP, sent a notice of intent to sue xAI and subsidiary MZX Tech LLC, saying the company's use of dozens of natural gas-burning turbines requires a federal permit, violates the Clean Air Act and harms nearby communities. Pollution from the turbines, which xAI has also used in Memphis, Tennessee, for its Colossus 1 and Colossus 2 data centers, has been a major source of local contention for more than a year. Plans for a third data center in Southaven, located about 20 miles from Memphis, were announced early this year, when Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves said he expected the project to create \"hundreds of permanent jobs throughout DeSoto County.\"Launched by Musk in 2023, xAI is trying to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the booming generative AI market. On Feb. 2, Musk said SpaceX, his rocket maker and defense contractor, acquired xAI in a deal that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Musk is banking on the area in and around Memphis as the foundation of his AI ambitions, and he's been flouting environmental rules in order to develop as quickly as possible. Musk's social network X, formerly Twitter, is also owned by xAI, which created the Grok AI chatbot and image generator.XAI is currently under a myriad of government investigations in Europe, Asia and the U.S. after Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake porn, including explicit imagery depicting child sexual abuse.  Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their health caused by xAI's use of natural gas turbines. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes in the area.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, had previously said they would sue to stop xAI's un-permitted use of the turbines in Memphis. But they stopped short of filing a legal complaint after Shelby County's health department allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued permits for their use. At the federal level, the EPA recently clarified gray areas of the law and said these turbines can't be categorized as temporary non-road engines. Nonetheless, xAI has been using the turbines across state lines without obtaining federal permits. XAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Noise pollution from the turbines has also been a source of local consternation. Jason Haley, a Southaven resident, told CNBC the turbines make headache-inducing noises around the clock that he can hear inside his home.Haley is part of a group called Safe and Sound which documents the decibel levels, and is pressing local officials to stop xAI from making so much noise, especially overnight, with its turbines.Mississippi officials will hold a public hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, for community members who wish to express their concerns about xAI's expansion plans in the area. The hearing will focus on whether the state should give xAI permission to install and run 41 permanent turbines at its Southaven facility, Mississippi Today previously reported. Similar community dynamics are playing out across the U.S. as tech giants rush to construct massive data centers, which can strain local energy and water supply and cause prices to increase.In November, Microsoft ended efforts to build a data center in Wisconsin due to the community's vocal opposition. Amazon also pulled out of plans for a data center in Arizona after community protests.In terms of Musk's Southaven project, Patrick Anderson, a senior attorney with SELC, said xAI \"has to follow the law, just like any other company.\"\"And when it flouts the Clean Air Act's bedrock protections against unpermitted emissions, it puts the health and welfare of ordinary citizens at risk,\" Anderson said in an email. \"That's why we intend to hold xAI accountable here.\"The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    "body": "Mesh Cube | Istock | Getty ImagesThe stock market has been quick to punish software firms and other perceived losers from the artificial intelligence boom in recent weeks, but credit markets are likely to be the next place where AI disruption risk shows up, according to UBS analyst Matthew Mish.Tens of billions of dollars in corporate loans are likely to default over the next year as companies, especially software and data services firms owned by private equity, get squeezed by the AI threat, Mish said in a Wednesday research note.\"We're pricing in part of what we call a rapid, aggressive disruption scenario,\" Mish, UBS head of credit strategy, told CNBC in an interview.The UBS analyst said he and his colleagues have rushed to update their forecasts for this year and beyond because the latest models from Anthropic and OpenAI have sped up expectations of the arrival of AI disruption. \"The market has been slow to react because they didn't really think it was going to happen this fast,\" Mish said. \"People are having to recalibrate the whole way that they look at evaluating credit for this disruption risk, because it's not a '27 or '28 issue.\"Investor concerns around AI boiled over this month as the market shifted from viewing the technology as a rising tide story for technology companies to more of a winner-take-all dynamic where Anthropic, OpenAI and others threaten incumbents. Software firms were hit first and hardest, but a rolling series of sell-offs hit sectors as disparate as finance, real estate and trucking.In his note, Mish and other UBS analysts lay out a baseline scenario in which borrowers of leveraged loans and private credit see a combined $75 billion to $120 billion in fresh defaults by the end of this year. CNBC calculated those figures by using Mish's estimates for increases of up to 2.5% and up to 4% in defaults for leveraged loans and private credit, respectively, by late 2026. Those are markets which he estimates to be $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in size.'Credit crunch'?But Mish also highlighted the possibility of a more sudden, painful AI transition in which defaults jump by twice the estimates for his base assumption, cutting off funding for many companies, he said. The scenario is what's known in Wall Street jargon as a \"tail risk.\"\"The knock-on effect will be that you will have a credit crunch in loan markets,\" he said. \"You will have a broad repricing of leveraged credit, and you will have a shock to the system coming from credit.\"While the risks are rising, they will be governed by the timing of AI adoption by large corporations, the pace of AI model improvements and other uncertain factors, according to the UBS analyst.\"We're not yet calling for that tail-risk scenario, but we are moving in that direction,\" he said.Leveraged loans and private credit are generally considered among the riskier corners of corporate credit, since they often finance below-investment-grade companies, many of them backed by private equity and carrying higher levels of debt.When it comes to the AI trade, companies can be placed into three broad categories, according to Mish: The first are creators of the foundational large language models such as Anthropic and OpenAI, which are startups but could soon be large, publicly traded companies.The second are investment-grade software firms like Salesforce and Adobe that have robust balance sheets and can implement AI to fend off challengers. The last category is the cohort of private equity-owned software and data services companies with relatively high levels of debt.\"The winners of this entire transformation — if it really becomes, as we're increasingly believing, a rapid and very disruptive or severe [change] — the winners are least likely to come from that third bucket,\" Mish said.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Roku jumped 8% on Friday after the video streaming company posted fourth-quarter results that trounced analysts' expectations and offered strong guidance.Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG: Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 28 centsRevenue: $1.39 billion vs. $1.35 billion\"The biggest driver of our subscriptions business is just the secular trend of more and more services moving into a service like premium subscriptions instead of just doing their own app,\" Roku CEO Anthony Wood told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on Friday. \"That's really, I think, the core driver.\"Roku executives said in their shareholder letter that the fourth quarter was the \"biggest quarter ever\" for net adds to premium subscriptions. The program lets users subscribe to different streaming services, like HBO Max and Paramount+, using a single login on the Roku platform. The company said it expects to roll out premium subscription bundles this year. Revenue grew 18% from $1.03 billion a year ago. Net income totaled $80.5 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with a loss of $35.5 million, or 24 cents a share, one year earlier.  For the current period, Roku said it expects to report $1.2 billion in revenue, which is higher than the $1.16 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. It also projected full-year revenue of $5.5 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $5.34 billion, according to StreetAccount.Last May, Roku acquired Frndly, a live TV subscription streaming service, for $185 million. The company also recently launched an ad-free streaming service, called Howdy, that costs $2.99 a month. Wood told investors on the company's earnings call that Howdy has the potential to become a \"very large service\" over time. Roku also said it's on track to surpass 100 million streaming households this year.Analysts at Rosenblatt Securities on Friday upgraded Roku's stock to buy from neutral, citing the strong fourth-quarter results and several potential growth levers for the company in the near term.\"Big picture — Roku has built a formidable gatekeeper presence for U.S. streaming — half of all streaming in the U.S. on TVs goes through their devices,\" the analysts wrote. Rosenblatt noted the improved ability to monetize streaming with its partnership with Amazon, a new ad tool for small and mid-sized businesses and tweaks made to the front page for advanced ads.Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. leadCorrection: Roku reported fourth-quarter earnings of 53 cents per share.

    "description": "For the 2025 tax year, eligible U.S. taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest under a temporary provision enacted as part of President",
    "body": "For the 2025 tax year, eligible U.S. taxpayers can deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest under a temporary provision enacted as part of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.However, most eligible borrowers will deduct far less, largely because even sizable auto loans don't generate anywhere near $10,000 in interest in a single year. That figure is closer to what borrowers typically pay in total interest over the life of a 72-month new-car loan, per Edmunds, a car-shopping and automotive data company.Instead, for most borrowers, the deduction is more likely to provide tax savings measured in hundreds of dollars a year, not thousands, according to automotive research firm Cox Automotive. Eligibility rules further narrow who can claim the deduction, since it applies only to newly purchased vehicles financed after Dec. 31, 2024, excludes foreign-assembled cars and phases out for higher earners.\"This tax credit is limited, won't be a market mover and is not a tool to substantially address the affordability challenges and high interest rates our market faces,\" Jeremy Robb, chief economist at Cox Automotive, tells CNBC Make It.Who qualifies for the auto loan interest deductionThe auto loan interest deduction was a 2024 campaign pledge by Trump, enacted starting July 4, 2025 as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The deduction itself is temporary and applies only to tax years 2025 through 2028.The deduction applies only to loans that meet the following requirements, per the Internal Revenue Service:The loan must have originated after Dec. 31, 2024 and be secured by the vehicle.The vehicle must be new — loans for used vehicles do not qualify.The vehicle must be for personal use, not business or commercial use.Eligible vehicles include cars, minivans, vans, SUVs, pickup trucks and motorcycles with a gross vehicle weight rating under 14,000 pounds.The vehicle must have undergone final assembly in the United States. That's roughly 50% of vehicles sold in the U.S., according to Cox.  The $10,000 maximum deduction phases out at higher income levels. For single filers, the phaseout begins at $100,000 of modified adjusted gross income and ends at $150,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout begins at $200,000 and ends at $250,000, per the IRS.While eligibility is limited by income and vehicle rules, qualifying taxpayers can claim the break whether they itemize deductions or take the standard deduction.Why most buyers won't get close to $10,000Even among those who qualify, few buyers are likely to see their tax bill reduced by anything close to $10,000.A 72-month new-car loan with an interest rate of 9.5% on a $48,000 vehicle and a 12.5% down payment would generate roughly $3,800 in interest in the first year, according to analysis from Cox Automotive. Interest costs fall to about $3,200 in the second year and roughly $2,600 in the third year.While the full amount of interest is deductible, it only reduces the portion of income subject to tax, not taxes owed dollar for dollar. As a result, the actual tax savings are smaller than the interest paid.Assuming a federal tax rate of about 15% to 20% for new-vehicle buyers, the first-year deduction would translate into less than $750 in tax savings, according to Cox Automotive calculations. In the second year, the savings would fall to about $640 as interest costs decline.It would take a loan of roughly $112,000 to generate $10,000 in deductible interest in the first year alone, says Robb.How to claim the deduction on your tax returnThe deduction is claimed on Schedule 1-A, an updated attachment to Form 1040, which tax software will complete automatically for most filers.Taxpayers must include the vehicle identification number, or VIN, on their tax return for any year the deduction is claimed. The VIN is a 17-character number typically visible on the driver's side of the dashboard near the windshield or inside the driver's door frame, and it also appears on vehicle documents such as the title or insurance card. Buyers can use the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's VIN Decoder, which identifies a vehicle's assembly plant, to confirm whether it was finally assembled in the United States.Lenders must provide borrowers with a statement showing the total amount of interest paid on a qualifying vehicle loan.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of Dubai speaks at a news conference on Nov. 10, 2005 in New York City. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.On Friday, DP World announced in a statement that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a \"close personal friend\" and called him one of his most trusted friends in other files. Sulayem has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. A disclosure to Nasdaq Dubai, where DP World maintains listed bonds, said Sulayem had resigned \"effective immediately.\"Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company \"affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.\"CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he served as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response.Kazim was most recently the governor of the DIFC, Dubai's financial center. Narayan was deputy CEO and CFO at DP World since 2005. Sulayem is one of Dubai's most prominent business figures, coming from one of the Emirate's main families. His father was an advisor to the ruling Al Maktoum family and Sulayem played a key role in the ascendance of Dubai as an economic hub.Sulayem oversaw the growth of Dubai's Jebel Ali port into a major deep-water shipping hub and the expansion of DP World into an international logistics empire that now oversees ports handling a tenth of the world's container trade.He also led Nakheel Properties, a Dubai government-owned developer, though he was replaced amid a major board restructuring following Dubai World's debt issues during the 2008 financial crisis. A 'close personal friend' of Epstein The extent of Sulayem's relationship with Epstein emerged in recent weeks following the release of the latest files.The records show the Emirati businessman was in contact with Epstein after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Authorities have stressed that a mention in the Epstein files does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Jeffrey Epstein and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group CEO of DP World.House Oversight Committee Democrats Pressure from DP World's partnersThis week, pressure mounted on Sulayem to resign after international partners paused new deals with DP World, calling for the company to take the \"required action.\" Canada's second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, which has invested more than $5 billion alongside DP World over the past decade, said it would pause \"additional capital deployment alongside the company.\"In a statement sent to CNBC, La Caisse said it was \"important to distinguish the company, DP World, from the individual, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who is the focus of the current situation.\"\"On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions,\" the pension fund added. A spokesperson for British International Investment, which invests with DP World in four African ports, said it would also pause new investments.\"In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.\"",

Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence startup Cohere has told investors that it's seeing momentum with enterprise customers, even as rivals like Google, Anthropic and OpenAI claw for market share. Cohere hit roughly $240 million in annual recurring revenue last year, surpassing its $200 million target, according to a February investor memo viewed by CNBC. It saw quarter-over-quarter growth of more than 50% throughout 2025, the memo said. \"Our thesis is clearly resonating in the market,\" the company wrote. \"Our sales pipeline continues to grow as global organizations across regulated sectors choose Cohere as their trusted partner for secure AI adoption at scale.\"Founded in Toronto in 2019, Cohere develops models and builds software tools for businesses. The company is backed by investors including Nvidia and Salesforce Ventures, and its valuation has swelled to roughly $7 billion.Cohere's investor memo comes after CEO Aidan Gomez said in October that the startup hopes to make its public market debut \"soon.\" He told Bloomberg that he thinks investors would welcome a \"pure play AI investment opportunity.\"But Cohere's competitors OpenAI and Anthropic are also weighing potential initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the companies' thinking who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential.

Those sizable customer bases present real challenges for other startups that are looking to keep up. Cohere told investors that its \"capital-efficient model\" sets it apart from its rivals in the industry.The company primarily generates revenue from software, and it said it can avoid hefty infrastructure costs because customers can run its models through managed cloud services or on their own hardware directly. This approach allows Cohere to invest \"more aggressively\" in customer acquisition and research and development, according to its investor memo.Cohere's gross margins averaged around 70% in 2025, expanding by 25 basis points year over year, the memo said.\"By scaling compute resources proportionally to customer demand, we remain insulated from the speculative excesses surrounding the broader AI market, positioning Cohere for more sustainable growth,\" Cohere wrote.In 2026, Cohere said it will continue to expand in Europe and build out its AI agent platform, North. The company told investors that it anticipates another year of \"rapid growth.\"WATCH: Cohere CEO names the barriers to enterprise AI adoptionwatch now",

It is giving away money packets, too, with some an auspicious CNY8,888, about $1,280.Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba are offering even bigger digital red envelopes, with some as high as CNY10,000, about $1,450, as well as vouchers, gadgets, and other freebies. Baidu has allocated CNY500 million, about $72 million, to promote its Ernie chatbot. Tencent doubled that at CNY1 billion, about $145 million, for its Yuanbao model. Alibaba is spending a whopping CNY3 billion, about $434 million, to get users to try out Qwen. The giveaways have created such a commotion that Alibaba admitted it had to \"urgently add resources\" to end outages on its Qwen app.Analysts say companies see this moment as key to grab AI-curious customers for their own survival.\"They are in a high-stakes race to capture users and build developer ecosystems before rivals lock in market dominance,\" Charlie Dai, principal analyst at research group Forrester, told CNBC. \"The issue is that profitability and sustainable business models remain unclear, for every major player in the global market.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. leadCompanies are upgrading their models as well. On Thursday, ByteDance officially unveiled a new video generation model Seedance 2.0, which the company said is designed for professional film production. An AI-generated video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting made on the platform quickly went viral and turned heads in Hollywood.The new AI release has already gotten the attention of Elon Musk, who replied to a post about the release on his social media platform X with the comment, \"It's happening fast.\"   On Wednesday, Startup Zhipu AI, or Z.ai outside of China, rolled out a new AI model GLM-5 to compete with rivals like Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 on coding and other tasks. Shanghai-based MiniMax has released its M2.5 model for the public to test. The industry expects DeepSeek and Alibaba to announce next-generation models around the holidays, too.Lunar New Year traditionally is a time when people spend and companies create buzz around new products. A year ago, Chinese startup DeepSeek shocked the industry globally when it released its low-cost AI model—a development often referred to as the \"DeepSeek moment.\"The cash incentives and cutthroat competition are reminiscent of the early stages in other industries Beijing aimed to dominate globally, like steel, solar panels, and EVs, that eventually led to pushback from its trading partners for flooding world markets with unfairly cheap products.In 2015, Lunar New Year promotions for tech giant Tencent led to explosive growth for the company's now dominant messaging app WeChat.Amid the aggressive AI promotions, Beijing is also joining the push.Premier Li Qiang chaired a government study session on AI, calling for stronger coordination of data, computing, power and the internet, saying China should accelerate the \"large-scale commercial application\" of AI.watch now",

    "body": "A Waymo autonomous taxi outside the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo's cars are driven without humans. But when a departing passenger leaves a door open, the car won't move until a person closes it. For that task, Waymo is turning to gig workers from companies like DoorDash. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company confirmed on Thursday that it's running a pilot in Atlanta to compensate delivery drivers for closing Waymo doors that are left ajar. DoorDash drivers are notified when a Waymo in the area has an open door so the vehicles can quickly get back on the road, the company said.That acknowledgement came after a Reddit post showed a DoorDash driver in Atlanta was offered $11.25 to close the door of a nearby Waymo.Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint statement to CNBC that they are always looking for new and flexible ways for DoorDash deliverers to earn money, adding that future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures. Waymo didn't say when that capability will arrive. Waymo's reliance on people for simple tasks underscores how even the most advanced autonomous technologies still require costly human intervention for some basic operations. Valued at $126 billion in a recent financing round, Waymo is central to Alphabet's Other Bets, which are targeted at \"using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, including transportation and health technology,\" according to the company's financial filings. In Alphabet's annual filing last week, the company said the Other Bets segment recorded an operating loss last year of $7.5 billion, which included a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge at Waymo.In addition to DoorDash, Waymo is also paying users of Honk, an independent roadside assistance company, to close robotaxi doors. A recent Washington Post report said Honk users, who get paid to provide maintenance on Waymo vehicles, were offered up to $24 in Los Angeles for closing a door.On Thursday, Waymo began deploying its next-generation robotaxi as the company pushes to extend its lead in the U.S. Waymo currently offers its fully autonomous robotaxi service in six U.S. markets, with plans to expand to several more this year.WATCH: Waymo raises $16 billion at $126 billion valuation watch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to board Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit. The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that \"the tide is turning\" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.\"Trump's grip on power is slipping,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. \"Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families.\"The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy,\" Leavitt said via email.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement \"surge\" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets. A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.\"The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion. Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway. The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.",

    "body": "A worker stocks beef filets in the meat section of a grocery store in Washington.Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesInflation decelerated in January as price pressures eased across a range of consumer staples such as food and gasoline, though they remain elevated for certain categories, including electricity and home heating, economists said. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.4% in January from 12 months earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. That was down from 2.7% in December and lower than expected.Inflation is still running above the target of policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, which aims for an inflation level around 2%, economists said. Effect of tariffs and immigration policyInflation would likely be at the Fed's target absent Trump administration policies on tariffs and immigration, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's.Tariffs levied by President Donald Trump on a host of trading partners have put upward pressure on prices, as many businesses pass at least some of those import taxes on to U.S. consumers, economists said. Immigration policy has also put some upward pressure on prices for services by reducing labor supply, they said.\"Broadly speaking, inflation is still too high for most Americans and the Fed,\" Zandi said. \"But I think we've seen the worst of it. If there are no changes in policy — to tariffs and immigration policy — we should get inflation back to something more comfortable by this time next year.\"The Yale University Budget Lab estimated in January that the U.S.' effective tariff rate had risen to 16.9%, the highest since 1932. The Supreme Court is poised to rule on the constitutionality of a large swath of Trump's tariffs in the coming weeks. 'Big caveat' in CPI reportThe slowdown in inflation was \"relatively broad-based\" in January, aside from \"some pockets of acceleration in services (particularly transportation costs),\" Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, an asset manager, wrote in a note Friday.But there's a \"big caveat\" in the CPI data, Zandi said: Inflation looks better on paper than in reality due to a quirk in the data from the government shutdown in the fall.The record-long shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12, prevented federal statisticians from collecting typical inflation data in October. Without that data, the BLS assumed that no price increases had taken place during the month for most categories of goods and services.Moody's estimates the CPI inflation rate would be around 2.7% if that data were included, Zandi said.Inflation report likely doesn't change Fed postureThe inflation report comes amid a backdrop of calls for lower interest rates from Trump, who recently unveiled his pick of Kevin Warsh to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Powell's term ends in May.

For example, gasoline prices were down about 3% on a monthly basis in January and by 7.5% on an annual basis, according to CPI data. Food inflation — for groceries and dining out — was 2.9% on an annual basis in January. That's high by historical standards, Zandi said. Likewise for categories like electricity, apparel, child care, medical care and home heating, he said. Prices for utility gas service were up about 10% annually in January, according to CPI data.Outside of gasoline, \"inflation for most necessities are well above target and in most cases above 3%,\" Zandi said. watch now",

    "body": "Gold and silver have rallied this year — and prices keep climbing.Gold futures for February delivery rose settled 0.8% higher at $4,505.7, after hitting a record of $4,530.80 per ounce. Spot gold was up 1.03% to $4,491.23 per ounce. Meanwhile silver futures for March advanced 4.46% and was last seen at $71.62 per ounce, while spot silver was last trading at $71.4449, up 3.51%. Spot silver crossed $70 for the first time earlier in the session.   The metals have soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as sentiment shook on riskier assets amid fears of an AI bubble and uncertainty over the next Federal Reserve chair looking into 2026. Gold is typically viewed as a safe bet in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty and is often used as a hedge.watch nowThe futures prices represent a fresh highs for the metals, topping Monday's record-breaking moves. David Neuhauser, CIO at Livermore Partners, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" that gold has more room to run — potentially hitting $6,000 per ounce. \"I think all metals, for the most part, are rising because they have been under-owned and there's a further risk that global debt around the world is just exploding, and therefore you need to own assets which will defend against that debasement. That's what you're seeing now. It's loud and clear, but it could continue for some time to come,\" Neuhauser said. ",

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesHoliday road-trippers are feeling some relief at the pump this year.The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. has been below $3 a gallon for most of the month — the lowest level since 2021, according to AAA. The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move during the period — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a 6-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey. Of those who are pinching pennies, 46% blamed the high cost of goods.The national average masks wide, regional variances, as Hawaii and California both recorded average gas prices above $4 on Monday. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, a gallon came in just below $2.30.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

    "body": "Novo Nordisk shares received a much-needed end of the year boost as the Wegovy maker became the first drugmaker to secure approval of a GLP-1 pill for weight loss, in what one analyst called a \"redemption for the investors\" after the stock's worst year ever. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron.\"As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey,\" said Novo CEO Mike Doustdar in a statement late Monday.Shares closed 9.2% higher Tuesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly shares have outperformed Novo Nordisk in 2025.Novo plans to launch oral Wegovy, or \"Wegovy-in-a-pill,\" in the U.S. – by far its largest market– in early January 2026. The company has also submitted the pill for approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities.Wegovy's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month, Novo said.Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers.Redemption for investors?The approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by multiple guidance cuts, mass layoffs, dramatic leadership shakeups, and a high-profile public bidding war against U.S. rival Pfizer.Novo's latest news \"is a redemption for the investors,\" Danish Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told CNBC, especially after a year in which shares halved in value as confidence faltered in Novo's ability to compete with Eli Lilly and others.\"A welcome 'Christmas gift' for Novo investors — and for patients as New Year weight-loss resolutions typically kick in — given that Novo expects to launch the product in early January 2026,\" Hallengreen Laustsen said.\"The Wegovy pill represents a key growth driver over the coming years and a critical competitive tool versus Eli Lilly, which is expected to receive approval for its oral obesity drug in March–April 2026,\" he said, adding that the Wegovy pill's approval covers both weight management and reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. watch nowNovo's clinical data looks \"fantastic,\" Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"Efficacy-wise, Novo's product, on the clinical trials at least, looks better,\" Kumar said. \"Tolerability looks quite attractive compared to [Lilly's orforglipron].The Wegovy pill has so far shown that it can help patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over about a year. Meanwhile, Lilly's pill resulted in 12.4% weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.\"Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute,\" he added. Even so, oral Wegovy must be taken on an empty stomach, and that might make it easier for doctors to prescribe orforglipron — which doesn't have the same restrictions — to patients because of compliance, Kumar noted. Novo has said it doesn't see oral Wegovy's food restriction as a significant barrier, as it can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach and then only requires patients to wait about 30 minutes before eating.Lilly reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly \"keep a bit of market share,\" Kumar said. \"That's the thing we have to watch,\" he added. Worst year everEven as analysts and investors alike are mostly optimistic about the Wegovy pill U.S. launch, investors will be watching how Novo and its new pill will fare in relation to Lilly's oral version. A first-mover advantage is no guarantee for future sector dominance and success.Ozempic, which contains the same active ingredient semaglutide as Wegovy but is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, had a four-year head start on Lilly rival Mounjaro. Still, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish. Lilly's jabs have also been shown to lead to greater weight loss.It has led Novo shares to plummet about 50% in 2025, in the stock's worst year on record.Investors have also voiced concerns about Novo's pipeline and how it might not stack up to Lilly's and other hopeful market entrants such as heavyweights Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche.— CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino also contributed to this report.",

Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines' profit fell 42% in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2024. But its stock has been on a tear.Shares of Southwest are up nearly 24% so far in 2025, more than any other U.S. passenger carrier. Industry profit leaders Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have risen about 17% each this year.Southwest stock this week hit a 2½ year high. Analysts and investors have high hopes for the carrier next year, when it completes its planned transformation from a one-size-all-fits airline to one that looks more like its larger rivals.\"What's helping Southwest's stock is clearly the initiatives, not the [demand] environment, because if it was you'd see it in all the other stocks as well,\" said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSouthwest Airlines stock compared with the NYSE Arca Airline indexStarting Jan. 27, Southwest is ditching open seating and moving to assigned seats on its all-Boeing 737 fleet. The first rows of seats have extra legroom — for a fee. Seat prices vary, but, for example, a Baltimore to Las Vegas flight in early February showed the seats going for about $80 each way. Southwest in October forecast that assigned seating and extra legroom seats could drive $1 billion in pretax earnings next year and $1.5 billion in pretax earnings in 2027.\"Because the assigned seating, the extra legroom, kicks in and there's a lot of value in that, of course, [results are] going to be better year over year,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC on Dec. 10. \"The bookings that we're seeing reflect the business case for assigned seating and extra legroom.\"Barclays upgraded Southwest's stock earlier this month, with transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski forecasting Southwest's adjusted earnings will be above $4 per share next year and surpass $6 per share in 2027.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesThe end of the cattle call boarding lineup comes months after the Dallas carrier got rid of another decades-old policy: two free checked bags for customers.

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which examines how people earn, spend and save their money.Nabeel Khan knew he wanted to be an entrepreneur early in life.In high school, Khan hired \"12 of the smartest kids I could find,\" he says, and co-founded an AP tutoring company. They charged between $20 and $50 per hour and made \"about $5,000\" within the first month, he says. He says he loved the challenge of working in customer service and balancing costs and earnings.The now-27-year-old went on to study materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan, thinking he might dive into the world of sports equipment after college. But over time, he says he realized he could have a bigger impact as an entrepreneur in the tech world. When he graduated in 2020, Khan accepted an offer as an operations manager at an Amazon warehouse, which became an entryway into tech. While his initial offer as an operations manager was for $50,000 per year, within five years, Khan says he was working as a senior AI product manager at the company earning $432,000 per year, including base pay and company stock. Khan left Amazon in July 2025 to pursue entrepreneurship and co-founded SkillAxis, which creates AI product managers for non-tech companies. His quick rise at Amazon and the savings he amassed enabled his departure, he says.Here's how he built his career at the tech giant and made the transition to entrepreneurship, and a look at his life in Brooklyn, New York, where he currently lives with his girlfriend.Khan looked for mentors and built out his skillsAt Amazon, Khan immediately began looking into how he could grow in the company, specifically in roles that would contribute to his dream of becoming an entrepreneur. He discovered the roles of project manager and product manger, both of which would be promotions and teach him skills like managing people and designing products.To learn more about how to get hired for those roles, Khan looked for mentors who held them both within Amazon and outside of it. He says each mentor gave him advice about which skills he would need to get hired, as well as specific project ideas for how he could prove he had what it took to move forward.Khan in his apartment building in Brooklyn, New York.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItKhan created an educational road map for himself and says he would spend evenings and weekends working on gaining new skills he hoped would help him get promoted. For example, he spent six months taking a software bootcamp class from the Georgia Institute of Technology to learn how to code, he says, and got certified in Amazon Web Services. He also looked for opportunities to practice and gain new skills while in his current job. In his role as an operations manager, for example, he helped update the safety system in the warehouse, which helped build his portfolio to become a project manager. \"I was always finding ways to be creative about the role that I was currently in, going above and beyond to find ways that I could apply that next role,\" Khan says. By mid-2021, Khan was promoted to project manager, earning $66,000 a year. By mid-2023, he moved into a product manager role, earning $146,000, and by 2025, he was a senior product manager earning $432,000. Building up $666,000 in savings and investmentsWhile at Amazon, Khan says he saved upwards of 80% of his income, accruing around $666,000 by the time he left between his various savings, investment and retirement accounts. In part, it's why he felt comfortable leaving, he says. He knew if anything went awry, he'd have a financial cushion to fall back on.During that time, he primarily held positions that were either remote or required a lot of travel, enabling him to save money on housing. Instead of having a home base where he paid rent, he split time between his parents' home in Georgia and his girlfriend's home in New York in between work trips.Khan at a local bodega.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItWhen he finally made the leap to becoming an entrepreneur, Khan first lived off of his savings.Between July and November 2025, SkillAxis brought in about $51,000 in sales. He now pays himself about $5,000 per month from the company to cover his living expenses.He keeps his expenses to about $5,000 per monthAside from having built up a financial cushion, Khan left Amazon in July because as he plans for his future, he says this is his window to make a big career swing. Khan lives with his girlfriend in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. Here's how he spent his money in October. Nabeel Khan's spending breakdown in October 2025.Alisa Stern | CNBC Make ItRent: $2,125Food: $1,238 for groceries and dining outTransportation: $899 for the subway and rideshares Health insurance: $289Business expenses: $198 for a Filmic Pro subscription and travelSubscriptions: $143 for his two gym memberships, his Wall Street Journal subscription, Spotify, iCloud and Google DriveDiscretionary: $93 for laundry and entertainmentKhan and his girlfriend split their rent 50/50, and his girlfriend has a stipend from law school, which covers their Wi-Fi and various utilities. Khan is still on his family's phone plan, which covers his phone bill. He's already paid off his student loans — around $50,000 worth — and currently has no credit card debt.Despite Khan's history of saving, he's not currently contributing to his savings as he builds his business. He says he'll resume saving money in the future after his company grows. As of early November 2025, his net worth is about $703,000, including his checking accounts, savings, investments, retirement accounts, cryptocurrency and a couple of watches, worth around $6,000 each. Khan in his apartment.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItAs a kid, Khan says he remembers seeing his dad watch a commercial for an Omega watch and comment about how nice it would be to own one. Once Khan made enough at Amazon, \"I ended up getting one for him,\" he says.'Be creative about what you can do in your current environment'Going forward, \"my financial goal is to have an overall net worth of $1 million by the time I'm 30,\" Khan says. He wants to enter his 30s with more financial stability. To get there, he'll double down on making sure his company is successful by identifying gaps in software tools and letting the market guide them to build the solutions their clients need, he says.For anyone who wants to try and copy his career growth, \"just be creative about what you can do in your current environment,\" he says. If you find ways to go above and beyond your job description, \"you'll end up benefiting yourself and your reputation wherever you are.\"Khan at an event.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItKhan currently spends about 80 hours per week working, and the rest working out and seeing the people he cares about most. \"A successful life to me is one that balances work as well as time with family and friends,\" he says.But big picture, he is happy with the balance he's struck in life. Between building his company and spending time with his family and friends, \"I think I'm living my dream life right now,\" he says.What's your budget breakdown? Share your story with us for a chance to be featured in a future installment.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Frederic J. Brown | Afp | Getty ImagesDETROIT – The U.S. automotive industry has entered a new phase for all-electric vehicles: realism. The industry was euphoric about the EV segment in the early 2020s, but consumer demand never took off as much as expected and, as it fizzled, automakers monitored and planned how to react. Now, they're pivoting, as companies have wasted billions of dollars in capital, Detroit automakers are refocusing on large gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, and many have admitted that policies, not consumers, were driving the charge for EVs.\"We have to make the investments to get to ... the regulatory environment they set. We've seen a complete change in that. One way, 180 degrees. One way, 180 degrees back. That's the world CEOs of automakers are living in,\" GM CEO and Chair Mary Barra said earlier this month during The New York Times' DealBook conference.How automakers like GM that invested heavily in EVs will respond over the next year will be telling for the future of the vehicles in the U.S., according to industry insiders and experts. Barra said \"it's too early to tell\" what true demand for EVs is following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase an electric vehicle. She said the industry will likely find its natural demand over the next six months.In the meantime, GM continues to reassess its EV plans after disclosing a $1.6 billion impact from its pullback in those investments, with more write-downs expected in the future. Ford Motor last week said it expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments.\"We evaluated the market, and we made the call. We're following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC last week.watch nowU.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.2% during the fourth quarter.\"The long-term direction toward electrification remains clear: The future is electric. However, the timeline is being recalibrated,\" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights. \"In the near term, automakers will continue to adjust their strategies and significantly expand hybrid offerings to meet consumers where they are today.\"Most industry experts, including those at consulting firm PwC, don't believe it's the end days for EVs, but rather that expectations are more realistic now. PwC expects the EV industry to pick up toward the end of this decade, with EVs forecast to make up 19% of the U.S. industry by 2030.\"As several of the U.S. [automakers] have announced, there's some level of charges, and we got out in front of the customer demand and likely the infrastructure that's otherwise available here in the U.S.,\" C.J. Finn, U.S. automotive industry leader for PwC, told CNBC.'What is the normal state of EVs?'That projected EV market share doesn't justify the billions of dollars companies have spent on the research, development and production of the vehicles, so automakers are significantly altering their plans to allow customers more choice of all-electric vehicles, hybrids and traditional internal combustion engines.\"If you think back a few years ago, it was like, 'If you're not all-in on EV, you're going to eventually go out of business. Your terminal value is zero,'\" KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC. \"Now I think that multi-propulsion technology approach is what's panning out to work out well. We used to call it the 'mosaic of powertrains.'\"A NYC charging station seen in the Yorkville neighborhood of New York City.Adam Jeffery | CNBCThe changes have taken different forms for companies that have already heavily invested in EVs.GM, which was by far leading in such investments in the U.S., will continue to offer its current models but has little to no plans of expanding in the future, according to Barra. Instead, it will use some of its planned capacity for increased production of large trucks and SUVs. The automaker also has said it plans to offer plug-in hybrid vehicles in the years ahead, but it hasn't disclosed many other details.Ford has said it will refocus investments on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models rather than pure EVs; cancel a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller, more affordable EVs; and rebalance its investments in core products such as trucks and SUVs.And Stellantis is deprioritizing EVs, including for its coveted Jeep brand, as it attempts to revive its U.S. sales. \"All of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC. \"The [EV] industry will slide. It's going to slow down. And then what is the normal state of EVs?\"Read more CNBC auto newsFord to record $19.5 billion in special charges as it pulls back on EV plansRivian's AI, autonomy impress Wall Street, but EV and capital concerns remainRobotaxis in 2025: Waymo plots global expansion as Zoox, Tesla roll to the starting lineInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsHyundai, which also invested billions in EVs, is taking a mixed approach compared with its peers. Like GM, it plans to continue offering its current models but it is also expected to have new models coming. On the other hand, like Ford, it's decided to more heavily emphasize hybrids and allocated production at a new $7.6 billion plant for Hyundai and Kia vehicles in Georgia.Others such as Honda, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo and Jaguar that announced ambitious plans for EVs have canceled or significantly scaled back those goals. GM also has backtracked on its pledge to exclusively offer EVs by 2035, including several of its brands before that time frame.The Tesla effectA litany of factors played into the current EV marketplace, including industry dynamics and external factors such as pressure from Wall Street and political whiplash from the Trump and Biden administrations.\"No doubt the policy had a big impact on customer demand. The net-net is the market's changed,\" Farley told CNBC last Monday.The bullishness around EVs began with the rise of Tesla. The company, which remains the U.S. leader in EV sales by a wide margin, was able to significantly boost sales and its market valuation from Wall Street analysts at the beginning of this decade.That led other automakers to take notice and, as the industry does, attempt to replicate Tesla's success, according to officials. But what executives didn't realize was consumers were buying Teslas — not just any EV. \"Tesla wasn't creating a battery-electric vehicle market. They created a market for the Tesla brand.\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. Tesla vehicles were, and continue to be, a \"tech-buy\" of software-first products that just happened to be EVs, Brinley said. The company also set up its own charging network and created a tech-savvy customer base of loyalists who looked past many quality and growing pain issues.A Tesla Cybertruck near General Motors' Renaissance Center world headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland / CNBCThat success led Wall Street to seek out the \"next Tesla,\" ushering in an unsustainable amount of new companies. From 2019 to 2022, nearly a dozen EV carmakers went public as well as a litany of related ones. Most of those have gone bankrupt amid federal investigations, scandals and executive upheaval.\"The attention that Tesla got woke everyone else up. But now there's competition, and there's competition from trusted, known and respected brands,\" Brinley said. The euphoria surrounding EVs started waning as companies kept spending with little to no success and \"legacy\" automakers entered the market, investing big sums to bring unprofitable vehicles to market.Hopes for profitable EVs further eroded with the second inauguration of President Donald Trump this year. Trump has killed or rolled back many of the Biden administration's support and funding for the sale and production of EVs. The biggest blow was in September with the end of up to $7,500 federal incentives for the purchase of an EV. \"The end of federal incentives came to an abrupt stop at the end of Q3, driving a lot of demand and sales for the new and used market,\" Jeremy Robb, Cox interim chief economist, said last week. \"Since then, we've seen the slowdown in both the pace of sales as well as the growth of new vehicle production. Next year will be pivotal for EVs.\"",

    "body": "Dr. Thomas Kelly is the co-founder and CEO of Heidi.Courtesy of Thomas KellyIn 2017, Thomas Kelly graduated from medical school and finally became a doctor — a career he had dreamt about as a kid and spent years working towards. But once he started practicing, Kelly realized that the job was different from what he'd imagined. \"My time as a doctor [was] very constrained. I only get 10 minutes for the patient,\" he told CNBC Make It. \"I was finding I had, you know, 100 patients to see in a day, and [was] always in a rush and always coordinating 700 tests and a million tasks.\"\"In a perfect world ... I would spend as much time with [patients] as they need ...  I would understand their family, I would remember them deeply, and then I would check in on them regularly,\" he said. However, the reality is that, like many other clinicians, he faced \"incredible burnout\" working in the field. Inspired to tackle this problem, Kelly created an AI tool that helps transcribe medical visits, generates clinical notes and more, with the goal of lessening the load on doctors and clinicians. Now, the 33-year-old is the co-founder and CEO of Heidi, an AI medical scribe. The company announced its $65 million Series B round in October, valuing the company at $465 million.Early explorationGrowing up in Melbourne, Australia, Kelly was inspired by his primary care doctor to pursue medicine. \"I just loved my primary care doctor ... He was like, the pinnacle of using your intelligence and knowledge for good,\" said Kelly. \"He always had an amazing plan. He was very warm, great bedside manner, but also, just incredibly sharp and intelligent always.\"That experience stayed with him. During university, he explored other interests such as math and computer science before ultimately deciding to go into medicine. In 2013, he enrolled into the University of Melbourne where he began medical school.While studying medicine, Kelly also started a side hustle where he posted educational videos on YouTube and tutored students interested in getting into medicine. To his surprise, the videos began to attract many students, more than he could handle at the time, and what started as a hobby steadily grew into a small business. To better manage his time during his tutoring business, Kelly began experimenting with building out artificial intelligence tools. \"The first AI product I ever tried to build was an interview tutor that people could practice with,\" said Kelly. This tool, called \"Oscar\" allowed students to practice conversations with a medical interviewer, and by 2020, about 20,000 students were using it, he added.\"That was the seed that grew into Heidi,\" he said.As Oscar improved, Kelly began to notice its broader potential. \"There was no [single] lightbulb moment,\" Kelly said, however, he realized that if an AI tool could understand a conversation between a student and a medical examiner, it could do the same for a patient and a doctor. \"You could then create clinical notes. You could do differential diagnosis, potentially. You could complete tasks,\" he said. \"That is the root [of] medicine. It's a very advanced, very technical, deep, complicated conversation, but it's still a conversation.\" Taking the leapBy 2021, Kelly was faced with a big decision: go all-in on his medical career and begin vascular surgery training or take a career break and try to build out his AI tool to help serve not just medical students but also clinicians and doctors. \"I took the leap,\" said Kelly. \"[I thought] I'll regret it forever if I don't take this chance. How many surgical trainees are good enough in math and have had business experience and can build this product? I think not many.\" \"Maybe it was hubris, but I thought if anyone can start this company, it would be me, and let's try and see what happens,\" he said. So in 2021, Kelly officially left his medical career behind and went all-in on building Heidi. Today, the tool assists in helping doctors offload some administrative tasks such as creating documentation, clinical notes and more.Heidi has grown into a strong business and has attracted nearly $100 million in funding. \"At some point I just [did the] introspection ... if you're sitting in an aged care home and your family's around you, what are the things you're going to regret? And for me, it was, I definitely would have regretted not having tried,\" said Kelly.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "A Starbucks barista demonstrates how to brew coffee using a siphon at the Reserve Store in Seattle.StarbucksWith tax season approaching, millions of workers could soon claim the \"no tax on tips\" deduction, which offers a tax break for returns filed in 2026. But some experts question which workers will benefit from the policy. Enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 of \"qualified tips\" per year on federal returns from 2025 to 2028. The tips deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 for single filers or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly.   Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

Republicans enacted the capped deduction via their multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending package in early July.Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates released in November. But not all tipped workers qualify.Lowest earners can't claim 'no tax on tips'Both parties promoted the \"no tax on tips\" deduction as tax relief for working families. But the country's lowest earners may not be able to claim it, experts say.\"Low-income households do not benefit from no tax on tips because they already don't pay federal income tax,\" Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. For 2025, workers won't owe federal income taxes until earnings exceed the standard deduction, which is $15,750 for single filers or $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. Above that, certain tax breaks, such as the earned income tax credit, can also reduce liability below zero.In 2022, more than one-third of tipped workers, 37%, owed no federal income tax due to low income, according to a 2024 report from The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank, showed similar findings. If tips were tax-free or tax-exempt, only about 60% of tipped workers would benefit, the organization reported in early 2025.watch nowSome tipped workers won't qualify Since the policy was first introduced, there have been questions about which occupations qualify for the \"no tax on tips\" deduction. The Treasury Department and IRS released a preliminary list of jobs in September. But certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs, from industries including health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and others, are not eligible for the tax break. However, SSTB workers may be able to temporarily claim the deduction for 2025 until the Treasury and IRS finalize regulations, based on \"transition relief\" released by the agencies in November.  With lingering uncertainty about eligibility, \"it's possible to confuse people into thinking they will qualify for this for future years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation.

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol in Washington, Dec. 8, 2025. Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesIt's a near certainty that enhanced subsidies for health insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will expire at year's end amid political gridlock — and some consumers are poised to be hit especially hard by the loss.The expiration of the enhanced subsidies would raise insurance premiums for roughly 22 million recipients, or about 92% of ACA marketplace enrollees. KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, estimates the average recipient would see their premiums more than double in 2026 if the subsidies disappear. But certain people — including early retirees, small-business owners, middle-income consumers, Black and Latino households, and residents of many states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 — would be more financially exposed to a subsidy lapse, according to health experts.An expiration would \"affect anyone getting those subsidies,\" said Nick Fabrizio, a health policy expert and associate teaching professor at Cornell University's Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. \"Then it's a question of who's in those groups: Who are the most vulnerable?\" Fabrizio said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

Health policy experts disagreeTrump officials move slowly on student loan forgiveness, payment plans: court filingCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThere's a chance Congress may act to extend the subsidies early next year. Earlier this month, a handful of Republicans in the House of Representatives broke ranks to join with Democrats and force a vote in the chamber in January on extending the subsidies. Even if the House measure succeeds, it'd face long odds in the Senate. Senate Republicans on Dec. 11 already voted down a three-year extension of enhanced ACA subsidies that Democrats proposed. Republicans have said they're opposed due to factors like cost and fraud, and have also cited an unwillingness to extend a program enacted during the Covid-19 pandemic.watch now\"It's virtually guaranteed at this point the subsidies will expire\" at the end of 2025, said Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF who specializes in the Affordable Care Act. \"What happens [in Congress] in January remains to be seen.\"Here's who will be most affected by a lapse in enhanced subsidies.ACA subsidy cliff will hit middle-income householdsACA subsidies, also known as premium tax credits, have been available since 2014. Congress offered a temporary enhancement to those subsidies in 2021 as part of a Covid-19 relief package. The next year, lawmakers extended the enhanced subsidies through 2025. The enhanced subsidies both boosted the value of the premium tax credit and made it available to more households. The policy also capped the amount that households pay out of pocket for health insurance premiums at 8.5% of their annual income, down from almost 10% before the enhanced subsidies took effect. Further, the enhancement eliminated the so-called \"subsidy cliff.\" Previously, households with an income exceeding 400% of the federal poverty level — more than roughly $63,000 for an individual and $129,000 for a family of four in 2025 — were ineligible for any premium subsidies.If ACA enrollees earned even $1 more, they paid the full, unsubsidized insurance premium. The subsidy cliff is set to return in 2026.\"The people who will see their premium payments increase by the largest amounts are definitely the ones who are just over 400% of the federal poverty line,\" Wager said.The Urban Institute estimates that average annual premiums for consumers over the subsidy cliff would jump to about $8,500 in 2026 from about $4,400 this year. watch nowPeople just barely over the cliff would be hit harder than those who earn even higher incomes, Wager said. That's because they'd be paying the same unsubsidized insurance premium as higher earners but would have smaller incomes to do so, she said.Millions of people are at the edge of the subsidy cliff. In 2025, about 3% of ACA enrollees — nearly 725,000 people — earned between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty line, for example, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis of federal data.  Another 7% — about 1.8 million people — earned 300% to 400% of the poverty line, it found. That equates to more than about $47,000 to per year for an individual and about $96,000 for a family of four. Early retirees on the hook for higher ACA premiumsOleg Breslavtsev | Moment | Getty ImagesMany older adults who retire before they're eligible for Medicare at age 65 buy health insurance on the ACA marketplace. In 2025, about 24% of ACA enrollees were at least 55 years old, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center analysis.Insurance premiums increase significantly with age, experts said. Insurers are allowed to charge older adults more than younger consumers, and often do because older people tend to use more health care, experts said. In most states, a 64-year-old pays three times as much for coverage as younger consumers who are aged 21 to 24, according to the BPC.The difference is \"very substantial,\" Wager said. \"If they lose their subsidy, or a good portion of it, they'll be on the hook for a lot more money.\"A 60-year-old whose income is just over the subsidy cliff would see their annual out-of-pocket insurance premiums jump from 8.5% of their income in 2025 to more than 23% of their income in 2026, according to KFF.For example, a 60-year-old earning $64,000 — about 409% of the federal poverty level — would pay about $14,900 in annual premiums in 2026, according to KFF. By comparison, a person with the same age living in the same place earning $62,000 would pay about $6,200 out of pocket since they qualify for subsidies, it found.Small businesses lean on the ACA Xavierarnau | E+ | Getty ImagesSmall businesses are less likely than larger ones to offer employer-sponsored health insurance, meaning entrepreneurs and their workers are more likely to get their health coverage through the ACA marketplace, according to KFF.Nearly half — 48% — of all adults under age 65 enrolled in a marketplace health plan are self-employed entrepreneurs, small business owners or are employed by a small business with fewer than 25 workers, according to KFF. By comparison, 16% of all adults under age 65 nationwide are employed by a small business or are self-employed, it found.Some occupations — chiropractors, musicians and singers, real estate brokers, farmers and ranchers, dentists, and manicurists and pedicurists, for example — rely on the ACA marketplace more heavily than others, according to KFF. About 34% of chiropractors, for example, get their coverage through the individual marketplace, it said. ACA coverage grew in states that Trump won in 2024Texas Children's Hospital's Kangaroo Crew members walk through the hallways during a simulation at the hospital in Houston on Sept. 23, 2025. Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via Getty ImagesExperts credit the enhanced subsidies for most of the tremendous growth in ACA enrollment seen in recent years. ACA enrollment has more than doubled since 2020, from roughly 11 million to a record-high 24 million in 2025, according to a KFF analysis of federal data. Most of that enrollment boost came in states Trump won in the 2024 election.About 88% of the total growth in the ACA marketplace since 2020 — 11.4 million out of 12.9 million new enrollees — is from such states, according to KFF. On average, enrollment increased by 157% in the states that voted for Trump, while states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris saw a 36% increase, KFF found. Enrollment more than tripled in Texas, Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana, Georgia and Tennessee, it said. ACA enrollees in Florida received $31.7 billion of premium tax credits in 2025, the highest state tally, while enrollees in Texas got $24.1 billion, the second-highest state total, according to KFF estimates. The two states accounted for about 39% of the total $143.9 billion paid to all Americans in 2025, KFF estimates.Black and Latino consumers may drop ACA coverageJgi/tom Grill | Tetra Images | Getty ImagesIf enhanced subsidies expire, certain groups with a higher uninsurance risk, including Black and Latino consumers, will be disproportionately impacted, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The share of total consumers enrolled in an ACA marketplace health plan increased to 22% in 2025 among Hispanics/Latinos, up from 18% in 2020, according to BPC, citing federal data. Among Black consumers, the share rose to 10% in 2025 from 8%. While they account for a relatively small share of ACA enrollees relative to white consumers, who accounted for 52% of total enrollees in 2025, \"recent coverage gains could be lost if the enhanced [subsidies] expire,\" according to BPC. \"When enhanced subsidies were enacted in 2021, the size of the market grew substantially because people could afford to join for the first time,\" KFF's Wager said. \"There's been vast growth, concentrated especially in Southern states, which have larger Black and Latino populations.\"",

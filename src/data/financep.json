Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's goods trade deficit hit an all-time high of $41.7 billion in October as gold imports surged on festive season demand, while exports to U.S. bore the brunt of steep tariffs.The deficit, which was sharply wider than Reuters poll estimates of $28.8 billion, topped the previous all-time high of $37.8 billion in November 2024, according to LSEG data.During October, India imported gold worth of $14.7 billion, up nearly 200% from a year earlier, data from the country's commerce ministry released Monday showed. Indian consumers are estimated to have bought gold worth $11 billion during the 5-day festival period in October.The impact of tariffs was also visible in trade data as India's exports to the U.S. fell for a second consecutive month since the 50% tariffs came into effect in August end. Shipments to U.S. fell 8.5% year on year in October to $6.3 billion.Despite the decline, the U.S remained India's largest exports destination during the first 7 months of this fiscal year, accounting for shipments worth $52 billion.India exported gems and jewelry worth $2.3 billion in October down 29.5%, engineering goods worth $9.4 billion, down 16.7%. Exports of cotton and man-made yarn and ready-made garments fell 12%-13%. The U.S. is the top export destination for all these commodities.Meanwhile, India's exports to China rose 42% to $1.6 billion.The country's merchandise imports are \"expected to cool somewhat in November-December 2025 from the October levels\" due to a sequential dip in gold imports as the festive season ends and some pickup in exports, Moody's-owned Indian credit rating firm ICRA Research said in a note on Monday.But it cautioned that India's current account deficit is set to \"widen materially to 2.4-2.5% of GDP\" in the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2026. It expects the ratio of CAD to gross domestic product to be around 1.2% in fiscal year 2026, if the 50% U.S. tariffs continue until end-March 2026.Trade negotiations between U.S and India have been underway for months, but a deal has been elusive so far. Both sides have begun to soften their stance, with U.S. President Donald Trump hinting at reducing tariffs on India.Reaching out to Washington, New Delhi has increased oil and gas purchases from the U.S. to reduce the trade surplus it enjoys with Washington. The country is also expected to purchase farm products from the U.S.",

    "body": "Christopher Waller, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Monday voiced support for another interest rate cut at the central bank's December meeting, saying he's grown concerned over the labor market and the sharp slowdown in hiring.In an increasingly divided Fed, Waller's comments put him squarely in the camp of those looking to ease monetary policy to head off further danger in the jobs picture. Others, including multiple regional presidents, have expressed opposition in recent days to more cuts as they view inflation as a persistent economic threat that could be reignited by additional easing.\"I am not worried about inflation accelerating or inflation expectations rising significantly,\" Waller said in prepared remarks delivered to a group of economists in London. \"My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order.\"The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee next meets Dec. 9-10. Markets are divided over which way the panel will swing following consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, cuts at meetings in September and October.Earlier Monday, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson was noncommittal on the upcoming meeting, saying only that the current economic climate calls for policymakers to \"proceed slowly\" as it contemplates further cuts. Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Wednesday that she sees a \"high bar\" for more easing.Waller specified that he favors another quarter-point move. Governor Stephen Miran, who like Waller is an appointee of President Donald Trump, favored half-point moves at the prior two meetings.While he has spoken out multiple times in recent months in favor cuts, Waller updated his comments to reflect recent developments. Absent government data during the recently ended shutdown, the policymaker cited a variety of other data points showing weak demand in the labor market and pressure on consumers.At the same time, he said price data has indicated that tariffs will not have a long-lasting impact on inflation. Cutting rates again will be an exercise in \"risk management,\" a term Chair Jerome Powell also has been using.\"I worry that restrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is affecting lower-and middle-income consumers,\" Waller said. \"A December cut will provide additional insurance against an acceleration in the weakening of the labor market and move policy toward a more neutral setting.\"Waller rejected claims that the Fed has been \"flying blind\" on policy as the shutdown suspended almost all official government economic data.\"Despite the government shutdown, we have a wealth of private and some public-sector data that provide an imperfect but perfectly actionable picture of the U.S. economy,\" he said.",

    "body": "Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) questions witnesses during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC on Sept. 17, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSen. Bill Cassidy on Monday proposed replacing enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits with pre-paid health savings accounts.The Louisiana Republican's proposal comes as lawmakers scramble to find a remedy for skyrocketing costs of Obamacare health insurance premiums.The boosted ACA tax credits, which this year have lowered the cost of Obamacare plans for about 20 million Americans, are set to expire at the end of December.Cassidy's proposal would allow people who signed up for a so-called Bronze Plan through Obamacare marketplaces to get a pre-paid HSA, funded in part by the lapsed tax credits.While HSAs would not help pay for monthly premiums, Cassidy told reporters that they would help reduce the cost of health-care expenses, such as co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance.Bronze plans  generally cover 60% of an enrollee's health costs, with the enrollee responsible for paying the remaining 40% out of pocket.\"Is there anybody who would not want to take a large portion of that, which we're using to help Americans purchase health care, and give it directly to the individual, so that 100% of its used to purchase health care, as opposed to, as opposed to giving that money to the insurance company, of which 20% goes for profit and overhead?\" asked Cassidy, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.The federal government shut down on Oct. 1, and remained shut down for weeks when Senate Democrats refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill because it did not include an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.Last week, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with them, agreed to end the 43-day-long shutdown by voting for a funding bill. Their agreement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, D-.S.C.,  promised to hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the tax credits.But even a temporary extension of the ACA credits faces a near-impossible obstacle course to being passed into law, in part because it would require Republican support. GOP members of Congress have long tried to gut the Affordable Care Act, which became law under President Barack Obama with only Democratic votes.Cassidy said he is talking with other senators, as well as the Trump administration, about how his HSA plan would work.With roughly a month to go before a planned vote, lawmakers have little time to finalize their plans before presenting them.Yet Cassidy's plan is already meeting with some resistance from some Democrats and health-care policy experts.Larry Levitt, an expert with the KFF health policy research group, on Sunday responded to an interview Cassidy did with CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\"Giving ACA enrollees cash in flexible spending accounts would help with out-of-pocket health costs like deductibles,\" Levitt tweeted.\"But, they wouldn't do someone much good if they can't afford health insurance to begin with and end up getting sick.\"On Monday, Levitt tweeted, \"Without the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, people would have a harder time buying plans with affordable deductibles.\"\"But, I do not believe this plan from @SenBillCassidy would cause a premium death spiral in the same way as other health account proposals that've been floated,\" he wrote.Death spirals occur when healthy people exit a health-care insurance plan, leading to ever-rising premiums for less healthy people who remain in the plan.",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe standard Medicare Part B premium will increase to $202.90 per month in 2026, up $17.90, or 9.7%, from $185 per month in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The increase marks the second-highest Part B premium increase in dollars, according to Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022.Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said.A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases. That said, other automatic deductions from Social Security checks for premiums tied to private Medicare Advantage insurance plans or Part D prescription drug coverage may reduce benefits, according to Johnson.The $202.90 standard Part B premium rate will apply to individuals with modified adjusted gross income less than or equal to $109,000, and for married couples who file taxes jointly with modified AGI less than or equal to $218,000.Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries pay what is called an income-related monthly adjustment amount that is added to their monthly premiums if their incomes are higher, according to CMS.The annual deductible for Part B will be $283 in 2026, according to the agency, a 10% increase from the $257 annual deductible in effect for 2025.The increases to both Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles are primarily due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the CMS fact sheet on the price changes.Income-related adjustment amounts are typically based on tax returns filed two years prior. Beneficiaries who have since had their income go down, or who have experienced a qualifying life event, may report that by submitting a form to the Social Security Administration.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Senate Hart building on Capitol Hill, on Thursday, June 8, 2017.Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday paused an order by another judge requiring the Department of Justice to give FBI Director James Comey all grand jury materials related to a criminal indictment that accuses him of lying to Congress in 2020 testimony.Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would rule on whether to allow the order to take effect after considering objections to it by the DOJ and arguments in favor of it by Comey's lawyers. Nachmanoff gave the DOJ until Wednesday to file its objections in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; Comey's defense team has until Friday to respond.The judge's action came hours after Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick issued the order, and suggested that the charges against Comey could soon be dismissed because of potential \"misconduct\" by the prosecution. The charges were filed at the behest of President Donald Trump.Fitzpatrick, in a written opinion, said he \"is finding that the government's actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct.\"He said that interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, who presented the case to the grand jury and asked it to charge Comey, potentially violated court orders and Comey's Fourth Amendment rights. There is \"a reasonable basis to question whether the government's conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of the law,\" Fitzpatrict wrote.\"The facts set forth herein and the particularized findings of the Court establish that 'ground[s] may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury.'\"Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationFitzpatrick acknowledged that ordering the DOJ to release to Comey all material related to the grand jury that indicted him, as well as an audio recording of the proceedings, is \"an extraordinary remedy.\"\"But given the factually based challenges the defense has raised to the government's conduct and the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings, disclosure of grand jury materials under these unique circumstances is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.The judge noted that the only witness to testify before the grand jury, who was an FBI agent, was notified by another agent shortly before he testified that evidence obtained in the investigation of Comey might have included material protected by attorney-client privilege.Fitzpatrick also said he had identified two statements by Halligan made to the grand jury \"that on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"One of the statements, which the judge called \"a fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law,\" suggested to the grand jury that Comey does not have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial.CNBC has requested comment from Halligan's office.Comey was indicted on Sept. 25 in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges of making a false statement and obstruction, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020.During that testimony, Comey had denied authorizing another person at the FBI to act as an anonymous source for news reports about an investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her emails.Comey, who denies any wrongdoing, was indicted only days after Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the former FBI director, who has been a longtime foe of the president.Halligan was handpicked by Trump to lead the Eastern District of Virginia's office after her predecessor balked at seeking an indictment of Comey.Comey's trial is currently set for Jan. 5.",

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., to force a vote on the measure.Former Trump ally and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has also signed the petition and criticized Trump's reluctance to release more Epstein case materials, leading to a major rift with the president over the weekend.In his latest message on Truth Social, Trump argued that some \"members\" of the Republican Party were being \"used,\" and that the party needed to \"get BACK ON POINT.\"In a separate post late Sunday, Trump singled out Greene, referring to her as a \"Traitor.\" On Saturday, Greene had accused the president of attacking her as part of efforts to \"make an example\" of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of the House vote on the Epstein files.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of underage girls and young women and has stated the two had a falling out in the early 2000s.However, the House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of emails that showed Epstein and others talking about Trump. Epstein did not explicitly accuse Trump of any wrongdoing or illegal activity in the email files.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that reports indicate the vote is planned for Tuesday, but has not been officially scheduled.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2023.David A. Grogan | CNBCAlphabet shares jumped Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in the Google parent, marking one of the conglomerate's most significant technology bets in years.Alphabet shares gained 3.1%, bucking the weakness in most technology shares to start the week.A quarterly 13F filing showed Berkshire owned roughly $4.3 billion worth of Alphabet as of Sept. 30, making it the firm's 10th largest equity holding. The move surprised many Buffett watchers given the billionaire's decades-long hesitation toward high-growth tech companies. Buffett has always seen Apple, Berkshire's largest holding, as a consumer products company.The Alphabet investment likely came from one of his two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who increasingly influence Berkshire's $300 billion stock portfolio. Though its size suggests it likely had the blessing of Buffett, who is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year. The pair have been responsible for many of Berkshire's tech-leaning investments, including a stake in Amazon initiated in 2019. Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of Amazon today.Alphabet has been one of the stock market's biggest winners this year, rising 46% as investors reward its accelerating artificial intelligence push and rapidly improving cloud profitability. Revenue growth from Google Cloud, once a margin drag, has turned into a key earnings driver.Changing of the guard?Bill Stone, Glenview Trust Company's chief investment officer, said the Alphabet purchase could reflect a broader approach to technology investments as leadership transitions to the next generation.\"Perhaps the purchase of Alphabet signals a widening of the circle of competence into technology,\" Stone said.Longtime lieutenant Greg Abel is set to take the reins for 95-year-old Buffett in January. The Oracle of Omaha will remain chairman of the board.Despite the stellar rally in 2025, Alphabet's valuation remains lower than many of its AI-driven megacap peers. The stock trades at 26.9 times next year's earnings, compared with Microsoft at 31.8, Broadcom at 40.7 and Nvidia at 31.8, according to FactSet.That relative discount, combined with Alphabet's massive cash flow and dominant market position, may have made the shares particularly attractive to Buffett's team.\"We think Berkshire likely finds more comfort investing in GOOG over other tech plays given the high free cash flow potential of its core business coupled with an attractive valuation at about 22x 2027 EPS amid a healthy top-line growth trajectory,\" Angelo Zino, Alphabet analyst at CFRA, said in a note to clients.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet year to dateBuffett has admitted missing Google was one of his biggest investing mistakes. He had a front-row seat: Geico, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, was one of Google's earliest major advertisers. The company paid about $10 every time a user clicked one of its search ads in the early days of online marketing.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"",

    "body": "Signage is displayed outside the Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. headquarters in Cockeysville, Maryland, U.S.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps on Monday, in a move to push toward a merger of the companies.Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. Scripps, for its part, has seen its struggles mount in the competitive industry and is among the smallest of its peers.In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in \"constructive\" discussions regarding a deal and believes that, if it were to reach an agreement, a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months.Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples, there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place.Scripps' stock rose 40% on Monday while Sinclair's stock gained almost 5%.Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing.In a statement on Monday, Scripps said its board \"will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\"\"Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan,\" the company said in its statement. \"The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company's shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States.\"The statement added that the board continues to evaluate \"any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.\"Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundles and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors.Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion.Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded to Digital Remedy.Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported.",

    "body": "Joe TerranovaScott Mlyn | CNBCJoe Terranova plans to stick by the winning quantitative approach that's allowed his Virtus Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum ETF (JOET) to identify stocks like Palantir early before the rest of the market has piled in over the last five years.The ETF — created by Terranova, chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners — has risen 10.9% this year, beating the 6.8% gain in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) in that time.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJOET, RSP YTD chartTo select the ETF's holdings, Terranova follows a strict set of rules-based principles. First, he and his team screen the 500 largest U.S. companies for stocks with the highest positive momentum, calculated using their total returns over 12 months. The top 250 stocks are then included in the selection list.The securities are then graded on three quality factors — return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio and annualized sales growth rate over the past three years. The top 125 stocks with the highest composite scores make up the equal-weighted ETF's holdings.Although the fund isn't actively managed in a traditional sense, it is rebalanced every quarter. Terranova said he doesn't miss the emotions of actively managing a fund, since his rules-based strategy has helped him capture alpha that he otherwise might have missed.\"In January of '24, Palantir qualified. Wasn't in the S&P at this point, because we're not scanning the S&P,\" Terranova said in the \"Quality in the Streets, Momentum in the Sheets\" episode of The Compound and Friends podcast with fellow CNBC contributor Josh Brown. \"I am telling you 100% I would have sold the stock if I had discretion six times over. I would have found six different times to sell that stock, the strategy, the discipline.\"Terranova estimated that he bought into Palantir while it was trading around $16.76. Shares of the analytics tools builder traded around $173 on Monday and have soared 129% in 2025.The investor also thanked his approach for capturing the market's \"personality\" and helping him get in early on other themes, like the current healthcare rally. On the flip side, Terranova's strategy has also helped him sell out of positions that he otherwise might have grown attached to.\"I have more affection towards the holdings that have been there for multiple quarters,\" he told CNBC on the sidelines of the podcast episode recording. \"Tesla's a great example. Tesla's revenue growth flattened out, and I could see what was coming — that we were going to sell Tesla. And on Halloween, the strategy liquidated Tesla, which looks like a pretty good move.\"Going forward, Terranova intends to build a suite of ETF products that applies his investing rules to other assets outside of U.S. large-cap stocks, such as small-caps and European equities. He believes his strategy will continue to succeed in allowing him to create a core equity holding and shock absorber for investors' portfolios.\"Momentum is a reflection of technical confidence. Quality is a reflection of fundamental confidence. And you want to invest around the confidence,\" Terranova said to CNBC. \"To me, that's where you get the long-term success.\"The JOET fund has an expense ratio of 0.29% and has around $240 million in assets under management.",

    "body": "Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast released Monday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad, who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group, today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.Gundlach said he is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making \"garbage loans\" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.\"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" he said. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\"Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a \"perfect mismatch\" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.",

All companies saw shares dip as much as 6%.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that computer makers are in the midst of an unprecedented pricing \"supercycle,\" as hyperscalers continue to accelerate data center demand, pushing hardware valuations to reach all-time highs.Rising costs in the DRAM, dynamic random access memory, and NAND memory, a flash memory typically used in memory cards, businesses could put pressure on margins, especially as memory fulfillment rates may fall as low as 40% over the next two quarters, according to the bank.\"This as an emerging, and potentially significant, risk to CY26 earnings estimates for our Global Hardware OEM/ODM universe, where memory accounts for 10-70% of a products' bill of materials,\" analysts wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Major DRAM and NAND manufacturers have been hiking prices as climbing AI infrastructure demand continues to bleed memory supplies dry.

After that period, people move to the new standard monthly direct-to-consumer price. The company's introductory offer ends on March 31. The announcements come days after President Donald Trump struck deals with Novo Nordisk and chief rival Eli Lilly to make their popular GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to access and afford. Those agreements will involve cutting the prices the government pays for the drugs, introducing Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offering discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January called TrumpRx. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\"Our new savings offers provide immediate impact, bringing forward greater cost savings for those who are currently without coverage or choose to self-pay,\" said Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, said in a release. \"It is part of a larger strategy to expand access that includes building relationships with telehealth providers and major retailers, expanding coverage, and working with the Administration to lower costs for people living with chronic diseases like obesity.\"The Trump administration said starting doses of existing injections like Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRx, but will \"trend down\" to $245 per month over a two-year period. On the day the deals were announced, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.Novo Nordisk's new cash-pay offers are available through Wegovy.com or Ozempic.com, the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, NovoCare, and other participating organizations and telehealth providers that work directly with the drugmaker, including Costco, GoodRx, WeightWatchers, Ro, LifeMD and eMed. ",

    "body": "Larry SummersCameron Costa | CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Monday that he was stepping back from all public commitments amid fallout from the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC.\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" said Summers, a former president of Harvard University who teaches at the school.Summers is a member of the board of OpenAI. He is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.CNBC has requested comment from OpenAI.Summer's statement came after Harvard's newspaper, the Crimson, published an article detailing his emails with Epstein, which came to light last week when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate.U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Crimson noted that when Summers was \"pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, he sought guidance from a longtime associate: convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.\"Emails and texts between the two men from November 2018 and July 2019, showed Summers, who was and is married, turning \"to Epstein for advice on his pursuit of the woman,\" the paper reported.That time frame was a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to solicitation of prostitution from an underage girl.In the emails and texts, \"Epstein was quick to chime in with assurance and suggestions, describing himself in one November 2018 message as Summers' 'wing man.' \" the Crimson noted.\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote that same month. \"I think I'm right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.\"\"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former professor at Harvard Law, told CNN that Harvard should sever its ties to Summers. Summer is the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and this semester is teaching five courses at Harvard, the Crimson noted.Warren said Summers \"cannot be trusted\" with students, given his past relationship with Epstein.\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren told CNN. \"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\"On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting on a request from President Donald Trump, said she had asked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and the bank JPMorgan Chase.Trump himself is a former friend of Epstein. The president has been criticized for months for the Department of Justice's refusal to release investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.The House of Representatives on Tuesday is set to vote on a measure that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files.",

    "body": "Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said on Monday that although gaming consoles are not going away, the industry is moving toward PCs in the next decade.\"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed,\" Zelnick told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that's never going away.\"Zelnick said the current split between console and mobile is about even in the market, but mobile is growing more rapidly than consoles.Although gaming giants like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo have remained focused on traditional consoles to major success, rivals like Microsoft's Xbox have hinted at more PC-based gaming for the next generation of hardware.\"It's kind of funny that people think about the console and PC as two different things,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said in an interview with TBPN. \"We built the console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.\"Gaming company Valve garnered significant buzz last week after announcing its new Steam Machine, a console-PC hybrid that can run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer.\"Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start,\" Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an X post congratulating Valve.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Although Take-Two's most high-profile titles, such as its \"Grand Auto Theft\" and \"Borderlands\" series, are largely played through console and PC, the company has invested heavily in its mobile segment after the mobile gaming industry rocketed during the pandemic.In 2022, the company bought mobile developer Zynga for $12.7 billion, the largest gaming acquisition at the time.The lofty purchase has since paid off, with Take-Two's mobile division leading the company's revenue during the second quarter despite the release of notable titles including \"Borderlands 4,\" \"NBA 2K26\" and \"Mafia: The Old Country.\"Mobile games from developers like Zynga, Rollic and Nordeus accounted for 46% of Take-Two's net revenue during the quarter, while console sold slightly less at 41% and PC and other platforms contributed 13%.\"Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable,\" Zelnick said Monday. \"And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly.\"The CEO said during the earnings call that the company expected the mobile unit to increase by around 10% in the next quarter.Although mobile gaming slowed down after seeing unprecedented highs during Covid, the market is seeing some reacceleration this year.Global mobile game revenue is expected to generate $188.8 billion this year, increasing 3.4% from last year, according to research from Newzoo. Console and PC are projected to earn a combined $45.9 billion, or 45% of the total gaming market.",

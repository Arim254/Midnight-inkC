    "body": "Carles Reina, GTM manager at Eleven Labs, shared why he invested in AI company.Eleven LabsThe angel investor who backed a billion-dollar AI startup when it was still in its infancy said he decided to invest in the company after just 30 minutes of meeting one of its founders.Carles Reina first decided to invest in AI voice startup Eleven Labs in 2022, when he was a venture partner at pre-seed fund Concept Ventures.Co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, Eleven Labs specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology. In its January Series C funding round earlier this year, the company raised $180 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion.Then in September, the company announced it was letting employees sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation.However, before Eleven Labs even had a concrete product, Reina, who was working at Palantir Technologies at the time, decided to take a chance on the firm after meeting Staniszewski.\"I met Mati when he was still at Palantir,\" Reina told CNBC Make It in an interview. \"We started talking, and within 30 minutes of the first conversation, I told him, 'How much money do you want?'\"Reina explained that before the launch of ChatGPT, voice AI hadn't garnered much attention because big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all had text-to-speech products, but they hadn't really taken off.\"With ElevenLabs no one was looking at voice AI, literally no one wanted to give [them] money. No VCs wanted to actually back ElevenLabs, back in the early days on the pre-seed round. So those are the type of industries that I really like, so that I can get in before everyone else,\" he said.Reina has made 74 angel investments over the past eight years, including Revolut, Volumetric, Elroy Air, and Speckle. He now works for Eleven Labs as a go-to-market manager.He said he always tries to identify industries that other investors are not paying attention to: \"I've done [invested in] mostly AI before it was sexy. I've done robotics before it was sexy as well.\"The No.1 trait to watch for in foundersReina specializes in investing in pre-seed companies — those with an idea, but often without a fully developed product. This means identifying key traits in founders that indicate a startup will succeed.\"If there is a product, fantastic, but if there is no product, absolutely fine for me … I love founders that are very technical. They're super sharp,  very smart, literally trying to build a global company from day one,\" Reina explained.He said he \"invests based on thesis,\" so if a founder is very technical, they'll have a deeper understanding of the product and the market they're selling to.Reina said he saw these traits in Staniszewksi, which convinced him to back ElevenLabs despite the voice AI market being very small at the time.\"No one wants to talk to AI voices if they sound robotic. That's fundamentally the biggest problem that there was right… so when I spoke with Mati, he talked about both elements, and he had not been in the market,\" Reina said.\"It was really interesting to see he was thinking about the problems of the entire ecosystem before even actually having any product or before even actually talking to any real potential customer.\"Staniszewski had a background in mathematics with a first-class honors degree from Imperial College London. His vision and technical expertise sold Reina, and ElevenLabs became one of the few startups that he decided to back \"literally within less than an hour.\"Now, Eleven Labs is planning a global expansion, including building new hubs in Paris, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico, as well as getting the company ready for IPO within the next five years, Staniszewski told CNBC in July.",

    "body": "A shopper at a grocery store in Dayton, Ohio, Oct. 21, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its much-anticipated consumer price index report, delayed a week and a half because of the government shutdown.Here are the five most important takeaways:While inflation is still running well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% goal, it's showing no signs of runaway and in fact is easing, at least a bit, in some key areas. The headline gain of 0.3% monthly and 3% annually both were slightly below consensus forecasts. Same for core CPI excluding food and energy, which ran at 0.2% monthly and 3% annually.Markets continued to price in a near certainty for a Fed rate cut next week, and upped the odds for another in December, with just a 4% probability the central bank won't ease two more times before the end of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Aside from the headline numbers, the biggest watch point for markets was tariff and immigration impacts, which showed up — a little. Apparel prices rose 0.7% and sporting goods costs jumped 1%. But smartphone prices declined 2.2% and are down 14.9% year over year. Gardening and lawn care services, an immigration-related category, posted a 13.9% annual increase.Shelter costs are another key category, as they make up one-third of the weighting in the index. There was some relief on that front, with the index up just 0.2% monthly and holding at 3.6% annually. Owners equivalent rent, a critical component of shelter costs that asks homeowners what they could fetch in rent, rose just 0.1%, the smallest such move for the measure since November 2020.With government data collection and reports under suspension because of the shutdown, the BLS compiled this report only because of its role as a benchmark for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. This, then, likely will be the last official data report released until the impasse is resolved.What they're saying:\"In aggregate today's inflation readings are encouraging, albeit still above the Federal Reserve's stated 2% inflation target. Yet, we think the overall inflation trend can continue to moderate over the next year ... as inflation breakevens have recently suggested, allowing the Fed to maintain its bias toward rate cuts.\"— Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a finalist to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year\"Look beneath the headline and what one sees on a year ago basis are large increases in the cost of food, meat, housing, and utilities. Middle class & down-market households experiencing a slowing pace of wage growth are clearly having difficulty adjusting to persisting increases in the cost of living ... It's only natural that those that inhibit the lower spur of the K ask: what is it that those celebrating a more modest increase in the pace of price increases see that indicates inflation is not eroding my bottom line & standard of living?\"— Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSK, on the K-shaped economy\"Signs of spillovers from tariffs remain weak and support the view that tariff hikes will translate into a one-off bump in prices instead of persistent inflationary pressures.\" — Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISM",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials is laying off 4% of its workforce.The company on Thursday began notifying impacted employees around the world \"across all levels and groups,\" it said in a filing. Applied Materials provides equipment, services and software to industries, including the semiconductor industry.Applied Materials had approximately 36,100 full-time employees, according to an August 2025 filing. A layoff of 4% would represent about 1,444 employees.\"Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,\" the company wrote in the filing. \"With this in mind, we have been focused for some time on building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.\"The move comes at the end of the company's fiscal year. Earlier this month, the Applied Materials forecasted a $600 million hit to fiscal 2026 revenue after the U.S. expanded its restricted export list. That resulted in company shares to dipping 3% in extended trading.As a result of the workforce reduction, Applied Materials expects to incur charges of approximately $160 million to $180 million, consisting primarily of severance and other one-time employment termination benefits to be paid in cash, the filing states.The company said the cuts are a way to position itself \"as a more competitive and productive organization.\"",

    "body": "A member of staff poses next to trading boards at the London Stock Exchange on April 25, 2025 in London, England.Carl Court | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe amount of money managed by hedge funds has reached an all-time high of $5 trillion, fueled by a surge in capital allocations in the third quarter coupled with positive investment returns.Analysis published Thursday by industry tracker Hedge Fund Research (HFR) showed total global assets under management stood at a landmark $4.98 trillion at the end of the third quarter.Overall industry assets swelled by $238.4 billion in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30.This included $33.7 billion in net new allocations from investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and family offices. HFR said that was the biggest quarterly net asset inflow since the third quarter of 2007 — before the Global Financial Crisis.The remainder of the third-quarter capital increase stemmed from positive trading gains made by managers throughout the three-month period.Here, HFR's main Fund Weighted Composite Index — which aims to provide an overall snapshot of the industry — gained 5.4% during the period.The index, which tracks the gains and losses of more than 1,400 single manager funds across all strategy types, is up 9.5% since the start of 2025.HFR president Kenneth Heinz said the \"historic growth\" has been driven by a mix of rising M&A activity among corporates, successful bets on the ongoing AI and tech boom and growing expectations for lower interest rates.\"While risk-on sentiment has dominated recent months, risks have also evolved, with managers participating in acceleration of these trends through year end but also positioning for sentiment and trend reversals across equities, commodities, currencies and cryptocurrencies,\" Heinz said.More to come?The big winners during the third quarter were equity hedge fund managers, who trade stocks long and short, often using thematic analyses, sector-specific approaches and fundamental single-company research.During the third quarter, they made 7.2% in investment returns, and saw their assets grow by $96.7 billion, including positive investor net inflows of $18 billion.Overall, that brought equity-focused funds' total capital to $1.5 trillion — making them the biggest hedge fund sub-strategy in terms of assets. Year-to-date, stock-picking strategies have gained about 13.6%.The other key beneficiary has been macro hedge funds, which invest in macroeconomic and geopolitical trends using equities, bonds, currencies, commodities and other assets.General view of the City of London skyline, the capital's financial district.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMacro strategies' assets grew by $33.5 billion overall during Q3, with clients pouring in $1.7 billion net, bringing total macro capital to $759 billion. Macro managers added 4.7% in investment returns in Q3. Having recouped losses suffered earlier in the year, the sector is up 3.8% in the nine months to the end of September.Heinz said the industry can expect more money to flow into its coffers as investors look to traverse a challenging geopolitical environment and trade policy uncertainty.\"Institutions seeking to strategically position for these trends, including both continued acceleration and defensive reversals, are likely to increase allocations to managers which have demonstrated their ability to navigate both the recent risk-on trends, as well as volatile reversals, with these allocations set to drive industry growth beyond the $5 trillion milestone into year-end.\"",

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

The company expects that deal to close by the end of Q4.With all of those transactions completed, plus the Altera sale, Intel will have $35 billion in cash on hand, CFO David Zinser told CNBC.The U.S. government is the company's biggest shareholder, and Intel stock is up more than 50% since Aug. 22, when Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced the deal.\"Like any shareholder, we have to keep in touch with them,\" Zinser said of the U.S. stake. \"We don't tell them how the numbers are going before the quarter. We generally talk to them like Fidelity,\" another Intel shareholder.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIntel 3-month stock chart.FoundryThe firm's foundry remains a work in progress.Revenue fell 2% over the year before, and it has yet to land a major customer.Intel now has two fabs running 18A nodes, which are designed for AI and high-performance computing applications.\"We are making steady progress on Intel 18A,\" Tan said of its latest chip technology. \"We are on track to bring Panther Lake to market this year.\"Zinser said the more advanced 14A nodes won't be put in supply until the company has \"real firm demand.\"Old stuff still sellingZinser said the company's older chipmaking processes, or nodes, have continued to do well, \"and that was probably the part that was more unexpected.\"Zinser said the chipmaker met some of the central processing unit (CPU) demand with inventory on hand, but they will be behind in Q1, \"probably Q2 and maybe in Q3.\"The supply crunch has been with older Intel 10 and 7 manufacturing technologies.Many customers are opting for less advanced hardware to refresh their operating systems, demonstrating enterprises aren't waiting for cutting-edge chips when proven technology gets the job done.Read more CNBC tech newsMusk calls proxy advisory firms 'corporate terrorists.'

    "body": "The headquaters of US auto company General Motos (GM) in Detroit, Michigan.Uli Deck | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesDETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.\"We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,\" GM said in an emailed statement. \"As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.\"GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to \"business conditions\" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are \"UP BIG on Tariffs\" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as \"Big and Midsized Trucks.\"While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "Hoka shoes are seen in a store in Krakow, Poland on February 1, 2023. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of footwear maker Deckers Brands plunged 15% Friday after the company trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka and Ugg — the two brands driving its growth — over concerns that tariffs are leading to a slide in demand.Hoka, an up-and-coming running shoe brand, is now expected to grow by a low-teens percentage in fiscal 2026 after growing 24% in the year-ago period, while Boots brand Ugg is expected to grow in the range of a low to mid single-digit percentage, after growing 13% in the year-ago period.In May, the company said Hoka and Ugg were expected to grow in the mid-teens and mid-single digits, respectively, in fiscal 2026 but it caveated that forecast by saying it was conceived prior to the introduction of President Donald Trump's tariffs. At the time, it quantified the expected impact to its costs but said it remained to be determined what kind of impact the new duties could have on demand.When reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, finance chief Steven Fasching said the impacts tariffs and higher prices are having on demand are now more clear.\"Part of the framework that we gave at the beginning of the year really said if tariffs did not have an impact on consumers, how we saw kind of certain growth, and we still believe that, right? But we do know and we are more currently seeing some impacts on the U.S. consumer,\" Fasching told analysts on the company's conference call. \"So as U.S. consumers are beginning to see some price increases. It is impacting their purchase behavior within the consumer discretionary space.\"He added the guidance isn't far off from what the company originally thought but acknowledged there is a \"little bit of a reduction\" in its forecast.The slower pace of growth for Deckers' two top-performing lines, along with the trim to their sales guidance, signals the two brands could be losing momentum after years of outperformance. Together, Hoka and Ugg account for the vast majority of Deckers' revenue and have been critical in offsetting weaknesses in other categories.CEO Dave Powers, however, downplayed fears of a long-term slowdown, telling investors that both brands remain strong among core consumers.\"We're confident in the long-term trajectory of our portfolio,\" Powers said. \"While tariffs and inflation are creating near-term pressure, Hoka and Ugg continue to lead in brand heat and market share gains across their categories.\"Beyond Hoka and Ugg, Deckers' full-year revenue guidance came in lower than analysts' expectations. In fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $5.35 billion, shy of Wall Street's $5.45 billion forecast, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $6.30 and $6.39, roughly in line with the $6.32 per share estimate, according to LSEG.In the company's call with analysts, Fasching warned that tariff costs could total about $150 million this fiscal year. Executives said they expect to offset roughly half of those costs through price adjustments and cost-sharing with factory partners.Deckers' shares have dropped more than 55% year to date, leaving investors on edge about any signs of decelerating demand.",

That game was won 11-4 by Canada's Toronto Blue Jays over the U.S.'s Los Angeles Dodgers.Toronto is in Ontario, and is the home town of Ford.Ford, in a tweet earlier Friday announcing the ad pause, said \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said, apparently referring to Trump.\"In speaking with Prime Minister [Mark] Carney, Ontario will pause its U.S. advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

But the ad accurately captures Reagan saying, \"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"The ad also has Reagan, from the same speech, saying, \"When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.\"\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said in the speech and in the ad.Ford, who calls himself a \"big Ronald Reagan fan,\" first posted the ad on X on Oct. 16, days after saying that Ontario's government would spend $75 million to run the ad in the United States.\"We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country,\" said Ford.Trump raged about the ad in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!! They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,\" Trump wrote.\"Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs, charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they, and other countries, can't take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.\"The Supreme Court in early November is set to hear oral arguments in a case that will determine if Trump had power under the law to impose sweeping tariffs against scores of countries, including Canada, without the consent of Congress.",

    "body": "ESPN and YouTube TV.David Buono | Icon Sportswire | Jaque Silva | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesJust a month after reaching an agreement with NBCUniversal to avoid dropping its networks, YouTube TV has another potential blackout on its hands — this time with Disney.Disney said Thursday it would begin running public messages for YouTube TV subscribers to alert customers that the company's networks, including ABC and ESPN, will be dropped from the service if the two sides can't reach a new distribution agreement, which expires October 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.\"This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we don't reach a fair deal soon, YouTube TV customers will lose access to ESPN and ABC, and all our marquee programming — including the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL seasons — and so much more.\"Disney began running public announcements on YouTube TV at 5 p.m. ET.As with NBCUniversal, YouTube TV is asking for better rates for Disney's programming, according to people familiar with the discussions. YouTube TV has about 10 million subscribers and wants more favorable terms given their scale, the people said.\"We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney's own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo. Without an agreement, we'll have to remove Disney's content from YouTube TV and if it remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.YouTube TV and NBCUniversal first reached a temporary extension to avoid a blackout before inking a finalized deal a few days later.Two years ago, Disney reached an unusual distribution agreement with Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers, that gave certain Charter subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney is willing to offer YouTube TV the same terms as that Charter agreement, two of the people said.YouTube TV is again asking to ingest Disney's streaming content, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the YouTube platform, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. YouTube TV also asked for this in its negotiations with NBCUniversal and was rejected. Similarly, Disney has no plans to say yes to this request, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.The clash between Disney and YouTube has an added element of conflict. YouTube hired away former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach of contract lawsuit. Connolly has recused himself from these discussions, according to the people familiar with the process.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were: (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Jana announced that it had partnered with Travis Kelce, Glenn Murphy and Dave Habiger in an investment in Six Flags Entertainment and plans to engage with the company's board and management regarding opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.Behind the scenesSix Flags Entertainment is a regional amusement-resort operator with approximately 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resort properties across 17 states in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In November 2023, Six Flags announced that it would be merging with Cedar Fair. While this news received backlash from some investors, most notably from activist Land & Buildings, the merger was completed in July 2024. At the time, this merger seemed like an opportunity to combine Six Flags' regional dominance in amusement parks, strong licensing arrangements (such as its lifetime IP agreement with Warner Brothers) and modern tech and pricing backbone with Cedar Fair's operational discipline, best-in-class park experience and high customer satisfaction rate to generate synergies and elevate Six Flags' asset value.However, this arrangement has not really gone as planned. In the second quarter, Six Flags faced severe weather conditions during their typical peak May to June season, which resulted in substantial EBITDA and attendance misses. Moreover, the company entered this period highly levered from the merger, and these misses only amplified the company's balance sheet problems in the eyes of investors. This sent Six Flags' share price down over 58% from the completion of the Cedar Fair merger to the day prior to Jana's announcement.Stock action like this on otherwise strong businesses that is due to an idiosyncratic event like weather that is not likely to recur generally gets the attention of good value investors. However, Six Flags does have other issues, namely poor operational execution, integrating the Cedar Fair merger and identifying a new CEO, as CEO Richard Zimmerman has announced he is stepping down from his role at the end of 2025.Jana Partners is now the fifth activist investor in this stock. Other include Sachem Head (4.82%), H Partners (4.59%), Dendur (4.38%) and Land & Buildings (n/a). All of those other activists, except L&B, have received board representation.Jana, as it often does, is coming in with an All-Star team: Glenn Murphy, executive chairman of Petco and former chairman and CEO of the Gap; Dave Habiger, chairman of Reddit; and NFL Superstar Travis Kelce. The investment group holds a roughly 9% economic interest and plans to engage Six Flags' board and management team to explore ways to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.Much of Jana's campaign echoes the qualms already raised by the other activists in the stock, including the company's potential to unlock value by reinvigorating the business as a standalone company with a new CEO and/or monetizing the real estate, or even selling the entire company. Regardless of which plan is pursued, the company must immediately start down the road of fixing its operational issues.Operationally, Six Flags has forfeited a substantial opportunity by failing to integrate its consumer-facing technology. More than a year post-merger, Six Flags still operates over 10 different apps, and even basic transactions like purchasing a season pass on the website have been unreliable, so modernizing and streamlining this technology could go a long way.The company also needs to reexamine its operating strategy during inclement weather and adopt a more disciplined capex framework. For example, despite this poor weather during the second quarter, Six Flags still kept its parks open on more days during this quarter than the same period last year, resulting in significant and unnecessary losses.Jana also believes Six Flags has the opportunity to leverage its existing real estate to implement year-round and inclement weatherproof experiences, such as indoor skydiving and trampoline parks.Kelce cool factorNext, the company needs to reinvigorate its advertising and marketing. Six Flags is one of the most recognizable entertainment brands, but its advertising has been stale, abandoning regional marketing efforts while also missing the opportunity to leverage its national scale. While the new CEO will likely have good ideas in this area, having access to Travis Kelce, one of the most popular and liked celebrities in the world across all demographics is a valuable potential marketing asset. (For example, look what Sydney Sweeney has already done for American Eagle with just one ad.)Kelce has not signed on as a brand ambassador or in any capacity other than as a shareholder, but he is a true fan of amusement parks like Six Flags, has already added advertising value to the company just by talking about it on his podcast and there is always a potential to do more with him either informally or through some sort of an agreement. Brand revitalization catalyzed by Kelce's active involvement provides a meaningful opportunity to lift attendance and engagement at Six Flags.JANA's partnership with Mr. Kelce is unprecedented in two respects: 1) it pairs an activist and a world-famous celebrity that has personally invested in the company and is using their star power to boost the company's brand from the outside in a highly authentic manner, and 2) it brings a perfectly tailored solution to rejuvenate the company's branding and marketing, reaffirming its cool factor and resolving any concern about Six Flag's brand relevance that has weighed on the company's multiple.Finally, and probably most importantly, the ongoing CEO process presents a golden opportunity to recruit a world class operator capable of executing upon these initiatives. In the world of shareholder activism, there are not many better opportunities for value creation than the activist having a say in identifying a new CEO for a great but struggling business.With multiple activists participating in this process, we would expect the new CEO to be a first-rate operator with strong views on creating value for shareholders. Moreover, a reconstituted board over the past several years and the addition of Kelce as a potential formal or informal brand ambassador may increase the quality of the candidate pool.That all being said, a CEO vacancy is also often the perfect time to explore strategic alternatives, and Jana is still urging the company to evaluate a potential sale of underperforming parks and/or the entire company.Should Six Flags position itself for a sale, there would likely be both private equity and strategic interest. Apollo, for example, attempted to acquire Cedar Fair back in 2010 before their merger fell through due to lack of investor support, and Blackstone already owns Great Wolf Lodge – a complementary asset.In terms of strategics, the growing media and entertainment trend of integrating physical park assets into cross-platform media ecosystems makes the industry a logical candidate. Media titans like Disney and Comcast have already provided the blueprint on how to leverage amusement parks to promote intellectual property.Paramount, the third peer to Disney and Comcast, is the only one without an amusement park after interestingly selling five Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair in 2006. This becomes even more intriguing now that Paramount has made a $57 billion bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery. Six Flags has a licensing agreement with Warner Brothers and at a current $2.6 billion market cap, would be a logical add-on to its acquisition by Paramount, or any strategic investor for that matter. (Netflix has also shown interest).Jana is a highly experienced activist with a track record for showing up with operators tailor-made for a company's specific problems, and that's exactly what they have done here. The perfect brand ambassador and two corporate legends with almost unparalleled consumer and technology-based operational turnaround expertise may be exactly the medicine required here. With that in mind, we would normally argue that this is too crowded of a shareholder base for Jana to gain board representation, as there are already six directors on the board who were appointed pursuant to an activist settlement. However, we believe that the activists with representatives already on the board are like-minded to Jana and would welcome directors of this quality to help pursue a path they all seem to agree on.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Workers at a factory in Houston, Texas build servers for Apple.AppleApple has started shipping advanced servers for artificial intelligence applications out of a factory in Houston, Texas, the company announced on Thursday.These servers are a core part of Apple's commitment to spend $600 billion in the U.S. on advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives, and the milestone could please President Donald Trump, who has called for Apple and other technology companies to do more manufacturing on U.S. shores.Apple's plan to assemble servers in the U.S. was first revealed in February. Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said on Thursday that the servers will power the company's Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services. Apple is using its own silicon in its Apple Intelligence servers.\"Our teams have done an incredible job accelerating work to get the new Houston factory up and running ahead of schedule and we plan to continue expanding the facility to increase production next year,\" Khan said in a statement.The Houston factory is on track to create thousands of jobs, Apple said.

    "body": "watch nowThere's just two months until Christmas Eve, and retailers are meeting a more cautious shopper with earlier offerings.Most retailers won't report third-quarter results or updated holiday expectations until just before Thanksgiving, largely considered the sector's most important week of the year. By then, many shoppers will have already started checking off holiday shopping lists.Amazon's October Prime Day sales event and competitors' ever-earlier Black Friday deals grab some portion of the holiday wallet share. The unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season comes as executives point to a bifurcation in consumer spending, with lower-income consumers feeling the strain on their budgets, and as a government shutdown and tariff costs threaten purchasing power.Kohl's is among the retailers chasing holiday shopping early with hopes of boosting the total haul.\"We want to make sure we're driving that early consideration knowing that they're shopping early,\" Kohl's Chief Marketing Officer Christie Raymond said at a media event earlier this month.The off-mall department store is starting its holiday marketing campaign next week, a week earlier than last year, when it waited until after the election. In the coming days it will be breaking out the rest of the holiday merchandise not already set out in stores.A key part of Kohl's holiday strategy is to capture shoppers not only early, but often.Raymond said during the last holiday season, between November and January, shoppers made \"15 plus trips\" on average to stores across the industry, but checked out with smaller baskets. Those findings were based on a survey that Kohl's conducted with a third-party research firm.\"[Consumers are] doing the work to get what they want at the price they want to pay,\" she said.While Academy Sports and Outdoors CEO Steve Lawrence agreed that shoppers are savvy when it comes to price monitoring, he said he expects customers \"to aggregate their spending around those key shopping moments on the calendar where they know they can get the best deals.\"Both Kohl's and Academy Sports cater largely to a middle-income shopper. Still, Lawrence said consumers are paying close attention to discount events.\"If we run the same promotion this year that we ran last year, there's higher take rate on it,\" he said. \"I think that's a sign customers are really savvy, and they're figuring out when it's the right time to shop.\"Shifting shopping habitsLawrence said that while promotions are part of every holiday season's playbook, Academy Sports will be tweaking how it runs discounts this year in light of higher engagement with the deals.\"If last year we ran a promotion for 10 days, maybe I only run it for 4 days over the Thanksgiving weekend,\" he said. \"Maybe instead of having a whole brand promoted, maybe it's only the key categories within that brand, right? Or maybe in some cases, it might be promoting at a slightly lower discount.\"Raymond said Kohl's is seeing shoppers reaching for lower-price options and expects that to continue during the holiday season.\"Customers maybe were purchasing a premium brand, but we are seeing them trading down to private brands,\" she said. \"We think we're in actually a great position to capitalize on that.\"A private brand is one made for and sold by only one retailer, allowing for more control over design and, importantly, cost. That can mean lower prices for shoppers and higher margins for the retailer than a national brand.Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile Kohl's doesn't disclose the proportion of its sales that are private label, Chief Merchandising Officer Nick Jones said it's not as high as it used to be, adding there's opportunity to boost that share this holiday season, particularly for shoppers trying to stretch their wallets.About 23% of Academy Sports business is private label, the company has said.\"In a lot of cases, [our private label] is our best expression of value,\" Lawrence said. \"Our goal is to be at or better than the best price on a given day.\"However, Lawrence said, innovation has to continue to inspire sales.'Cautiously optimistic'The retail industry has repeatedly described its customer in recent quarters as \"choiceful,\" to indicate thoughtful spending, but also \"resilient.\" Executives continue to use those descriptors, or synonyms for them, for the upcoming holiday season.\"I think certainly with inflation in certain categories, it's put some pressure on spending power,\" Lawrence said. \"But you know, what we've also seen is customers are very resilient. They do come out during the key shopping time periods. They came out for Mother's Day, Father's Day, back-to-school. We expect they're going to come out again for holiday.\"Dick's Sporting Goods Executive Chairman Ed Stack told CNBC this week he thought the consumer was \"a little bit stressed\" this season, but that he's \"cautiously optimistic.\"\"If you're going to provide value to the consumer, and they can see that, feel that value — and I'm not talking about from a price standpoint, could be innovation ... then they are going to come and they are going to buy,\" Stack said.Executives for all three retailers agree inventory positions for holiday will be normal, despite tariff uncertainty that many feared would affect order volumes. None of the three were expecting merchandise shortages.\"I don't think [inventory availability] is going to be any different than it has been in the past,\" Stack said. \"That really super hot item that everybody wants? That's probably going to be in short supply, like it is every year.\"",

This is about all of us,\" James said after leaving court, \"and about a justice system which has been weaponized\" and \"used as a tool of revenge.\"\"So there's no fear today,\" she said. \"I believe that justice will rain down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.\"James, at her arraignment, pleaded not guilty to one count each of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.James has decried the charges as \"baseless,\" calling her indictment \"nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.\"Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan, in a highly unusual move, personally presented evidence about James to a grand jury before it issued the indictment. U.S. attorneys normally have assistant U.S. attorneys present evidence to grand juries.After Friday's arraignment, James' legal team filed a motion asking Judge Jamar Walker to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that Halligan \"had no authority to bring the charges in this case\" because she was invalidly appointed.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

All Americans should speak out about the unjust prosecution of Letitia James,\" said Eisen, a vocal Trump critic who has been repeatedly criticized by the president.The indictment against James alleges that she made false representations in documents she signed when purchasing a three-bedroom home in Norfolk that was financed with a roughly $109,600 mortgage loan.A rider to that loan required James to occupy the home as a second residence and not rent it out. But the home \"was instead used as a rental investment property\" for a family of three, the indictment alleges.James' total purported \"ill-gotten gains\" were only about $19,000 over the life of the loan she received, according to the indictment. Most of that money was from savings James allegedly received from having a lower interest rate on the mortgage than what she would have paid if the home was classified as a rental investment property, the indictment says.Prosecutors who investigated James, in a September memo, said they found evidence that appeared to undercut the indictment's allegations, MSNBC's Ken Dilanian reported Friday.That evidence reportedly includes the amount that James stood to receive financially from her alleged mortgage misrepresentation: Only about $800 in the year that she bought the home.The prosecutors also questioned if the case could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. ABC News first reported the memo on Thursday, citing sources.This is developing news. Please check back for updates.",

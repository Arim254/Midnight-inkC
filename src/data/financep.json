    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage demand spiked markedly higher last week as consumers returned from the holidays to find overall lower interest rates and then a sharp rate drop Friday on news from the White House. President Donald Trump posted on social media late Thursday that, in an effort to lower mortgage rates, he would order mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. Just on that news, the average rate on the 30-year fixed sunk briefly below 6% on Friday morning before bouncing slightly higher again, according to Mortgage News Daily. As a result, total mortgage application volume jumped 28.5% last week from the previous week, which was adjusted for the holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. For the whole week, on the MBA's survey, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.18% from 6.25%, with points falling to 0.56 from 0.57, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Rates started to come down a little just before that, and part of it might be a bounce back from the holidays, even though we did adjust for the holiday in the results the week before. It's always a noisy time,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, adding, \"This was a real move based upon the rate drop. Spreads had been moving in even before the announcement.\"Refinance demand, which is most sensitive to daily rate changes, surged 40% higher for the week and was 128% higher than the same week one year ago. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The average loan size for refinance applications was also higher, as borrowers with larger loan sizes are typically more sensitive to changes in rates,\" Kan added.  Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home, which are less sensitive to sudden rate changes,  rose 16% for the week and were 13% higher than the same week one year ago. The increase there was probably driven more just by people returning from the holidays, easing home prices and more inventory available for sale.Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, according to Mortgage News Daily. They bounced Monday on the expectation of higher oil prices and then a little higher Tuesday. \"Things might have ended up worse today had it not been for a reasonably well-received CPI report (Consumer Price Index),\" wrote Matthew Graham, COO of Mortgage News Daily, on Tuesday. \"This important data showed inflation remaining in check in December, with the most closely-watched metrics coming in just below the median forecast.\"",

    "body": "watch nowCitigroup on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter results that topped expectations as the lender reaped more interest income and set aside less money for troubled loans than analysts had expected. Here's what the company reported:Adjusted earnings: $1.81 per share vs. $1.67 expected, according to LSEGAdjusted revenue: $21.0 billion vs. $20.72 billion expectedThe company said net income fell 13% from the year-earlier period to $2.47 billion, or $1.19 per share, because of a $1.1 billion after-tax loss tied its plan to divest Citigroup's Russian operations.Excluding the charge, profit was $3.6 billion, or $1.81 per share.Revenue excluding the Russia-related charge rose 8% to $21.0 billion on increases in banking, wealth and institutional services results.Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and investments and what it pays depositors, rose 14% to $15.67 billion, or roughly $815 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.The bank's loan loss provision in the quarter was $2.2 billion, about $330 million below expectations.At Citigroup and rival firms including Bank of America, lower-than-expected loan loss provisions may signal optimism about the economy and the ability of borrowers to repay their debts.\"With record revenues and positive operating leverage for each of our five businesses, 2025 was a year of significant progress as we demonstrated that the investments we are making are driving strong top-line growth,\" CEO Jane Fraser said in the earnings release.\"We enter 2026 with visible momentum across the firm,\" Fraser said.The company is \"committed\" to reaching its returns target of at least 10% for 2026 and positioning the bank for \"improved returns above that level in the years ahead,\" she added.Shares of the bank climbed about 1% in premarket trading. Under Fraser, Citigroup is in the midst of a restructuring, selling off parts of its overseas operations, while also benefiting from U.S. banking deregulation. Those are the reasons Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo calls Citigroup his top pick among bank stocks.Analysts will be keen to hear whether Fraser sees momentum from last year carrying over into 2026. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase posted results that exceeded expectations on better-than-expected trading revenue. Bank of America and Wells Fargo also released Q4 results Wednesday, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are scheduled for Thursday. This story is developing. Please check back for updates.",

Here's what the company reported:Earnings: 98 cents per share vs. 96 cents expected, according to LSEG  Revenue: $28.53 billion vs. $27.94 billion expectedThe company said profit rose 12% from a year earlier to $7.6 billion, or 98 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7.1% to $28.53 billion, thanks to rising net interest income, asset management fees and trading revenue.Shares of the bank fell more than 3% in early trading. \"With consumers and businesses proving resilient, as well as the regulatory environment and tax and trade policies coming into sharper focus, we expect further economic growth in the year ahead,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the release. \"While any number of risks continue, we are bullish on the U.S. economy in 2026.\"Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and securities and what it pays depositors for their savings, rose 9.7% to $15.92 billion in the quarter. That is roughly $240 million more than what analysts had expected, per StreetAccount.The bank also gave new guidance on net interest income, saying that it would grow 5% to 7% in 2026. Equities trading revenue rose 23% to $2.02 billion, or about $160 million more than expected. Fixed income trading revenue edged up by 1.5% to $2.52 billion, or about $120 million below what analysts had forecast for the quarter.Fees generated by the firm's investment bankers were roughly flat from a year ago at $1.67 billion, nearly matching the StreetAccount estimate.The lender got a boost from a smaller-than-expected provision for loan losses in the quarter of $1.31 billion, about $190 million lower than analysts had forecast. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets after JPMorgan Chase, has been a beneficiary of the industry's recent tail winds. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit, and deregulation have all helped the lender, whose shares rose 25% last year.Analysts will want to hear more from Moynihan as to whether momentum will carry into 2026.On Tuesday, JPMorgan posted results that exceeded expectations on better-than-expected trading revenue.

    "body": "A home with a \"Sold\" sign from a real estate company in North Patchogue, New York.Steve Pfost | Newsday | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes in December rose to a seasonally-adjusted, annualized rate of 4.35 million units, a 5.1% increase from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was higher than analysts' expectations for a gain of 2%. Sales were 1.4% higher than a year earlier. For the full year, there were 4.06 million existing home sales, unchanged from 2024.After adjusting for seasonal factors, December sales were the strongest in nearly three years. Sales increased in all regions month-over-month and were higher annually in the Northeast and Midwest, but lower in the South and West. This count is based on closings, so sales contracts likely signed in October and November, when mortgage rates weren't moving much. The average rate on the 30-year fixed loan hovered between 6.2% and 6.3% during that time. That rate, however, was lower than it was last spring and summer, when it was closer to 7%.\"2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for The Realtors, in a release. \"However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory was the big headline of the monthly report. There were 1.18 million units available for sale at the end of December, down 18% from November, although 3.5% higher year-over-year. With stronger sales, that dropped the supply to just 3.3 months, which is considered quite lean. Low supply kept prices in positive territory, although just barely. The median price of a home sold in December was $405,400, up 0.4% annually and the 30th straight month of annual gains. The increase, however, was smaller than the 1.2% gain in November. \"With fewer sellers feeling eager to move, homeowners are taking their time deciding when to list or delist their homes. Similar to past years, more inventory is expected to come to market beginning in February,\" Yun added. ",

It looks similar to the traditional Bronco but has some design tweaks and off-road performance parts that are also on the Raptor.Ford officials declined to discuss pricing for the vehicle but called it a \"more attainable\" performance model, or a gateway, to the Raptor. That doesn't mean it will be inexpensive though. It's expected to be positioned between the $51,475 Bronco Heritage Edition and roughly $80,000 Bronco Raptor. The base Bronco starts at about $40,000.\"The difference is the access point, the accessibility,\" said Ed Krenz, Bronco chief program engineer. \"This very much can be seen as a step into the Raptor family.\"2027 Ford Bronco RTR Courtesy FordFord said the Bronco RTR will be powered by a 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which is currently rated at 315 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque in the Ford Mustang. That compares with 418 horsepower and 440 foot-pounds of torque with a 3.0-liter V6 engine for the Bronco Raptor.The Bronco RTR will be available to order in October with sales starting in January 2027, Ford said. The vehicle is the second RTR model, which is a partnership with racer Vaughn Gittin Jr.'s \"Ready to Rock\" brand. The first was a Ford Mustang model the company revealed a year ago. Both were for the Detroit Auto Show.\"Bronco RTR is literally another dream come true for myself, my team; the opportunity to build something for enthusiasts that is attainable, affordable and have the looks, the capability, that only RTR and Ford can do together,\" Gittin said during the event.The new model follows Ford's strategy of leaning into its most well-known brands such as Bronco, Mustang and F-150.watch now",

    "body": "Shoppers walk outside the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., Jan. 6, 2026. Angelina Katsanis | ReutersSaks Global, the parent company behind the 159-year-old department store that's become both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday after an unsustainable debt pile crushed its business. The company also announced former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck will immediately take over as chief executive, replacing Richard Baker. He had been in the job for just two weeks, but had been involved with Saks since Hudson's Bay acquired it in 2013 when he was CEO of the Canadian department store. With van Raemdonck comes a revamped senior leadership team stacked with veterans from Neiman Marcus, which Saks Global acquired in 2024. Darcy Penick, who served as the president of Bergdorf Goodman before Saks bought the department store, will take over as president and chief commercial officer for Saks Global. Lana Todorovich, Neiman's former chief merchandising officer, has been named chief of global brand partnerships. Ahead of the filing, Saks secured $1.75 billion in new financing from a group of the company's senior secured bondholders and asset-based lenders. The lion's share, $1 billion, is debtor-in-possession financing that will be used to fund operations while the company is in Chapter 11 while an additional $500 million will be available to the company after it emerges from bankruptcy, which it said it expects to do later this year. Its asset-based lenders provided an additional $240 million in incremental liquidity. The flush of new money comes after Saks struggled to line up DIP financing, which will be used to keep the business running during Chapter 11 proceedings, CNBC previously reported. Without it, Saks faced the prospect of liquidation, which could've spelled the end for one of the most fabled department stores in history. A bankruptcy filing for Saks Global has been seen as inevitable for weeks after the company missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month. What is still unclear is what will happen to the company and the nearly 200 doors under its umbrella across Saks' namesake stores and its off-price chain, along with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. In a news release, the company said its \"evaluating its operational footprint\" to put its resources where it sees the \"greatest long-term potential.\" That likely means a trimmed down store fleet in the coming months to reduce the company's fixed costs. \"This is a defining moment for Saks Global, and the path ahead presents a meaningful opportunity to strengthen the foundation of our business and position it for the future,\" CEO van Raemdonck said in a news release. \"In close partnership with these newly appointed leaders and our colleagues across the organization, we will navigate this process together with a continued focus on serving our customers and luxury brands. I look forward to serving as CEO and continuing to transform the Company so that Saks Global continues to play a central role in shaping the future of luxury retail.\"How did Saks fall apart? Though it caters to some of the wealthiest shoppers in the world, Saks has been steadily running out of cash and failing to pay some of its bills after it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal heavily financed with debt. Still, Saks was struggling to pay its vendors even before it acquired Neiman. Through the acquisition, the company received a flood of new money that was supposed to deleverage the combined business and provide it with \"significant liquidity,\" Saks said at the time. The tie up brought a fresh slate of deep-pocketed investors from the tech world, including Amazon and Salesforce, and was expected to create a luxury department store powerhouse with an improved cost structure and stronger negotiating power. Instead, Saks failed to implement the turnaround investors had banked on. It briefly got better at paying its vendors, but then moved to a 90-day payment term, angering and pushing away brands that said the conditions were too onerous to work for their businesses. Soon, it stopped paying suppliers once again, which led to both a dip in assortment and sales. In the backdrop, Saks' debt began trading below its face value, raising questions about the company's ability to keep operations running and make interest payments to bondholders, people familiar with the matter said. Over the summer, it secured $600 million in new financing and sold off key real estate assets to drum up more cash.While those efforts bought the company some time, they ultimately didn't prevent a bankruptcy filing.",

The defendants also claim that post-employment agreements are \"facially overbroad and unenforceable\" and say Palantir's interpretation is meant to \"stifle competition.\"The lawsuit, originally filed by Palantir in October in the Southern District of New York, accused Percepta co-founder and CEO Hirsh Jain and co-founder Radha Jain of using stolen information to create a \"copycat\" business. Palantir also claimed the founders, who used to work for the data analytics company, attempted to poach talent and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\" Palantir accused a third Percepta employee, Joanna Cohen, of sending herself confidential documents after resigning and photographing sensitive information she downloaded to her personal phone. Percepta in December denied using any of Palantir's confidential information and called the case \"baseless.\"Attorneys said in Monday's filing that in-depth searches did not find any Palantir materials and argued that the screenshots taken by Cohen were done in \"good faith\" to help her complete tasks. They said the materials \"would be useless to Percepta and are by now stale regardless.\"Palantir declined to comment. WATCH: Highlights of DealBook Summit 2025watch now",

Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares linked to silver strengthened on Wednesday, after the metal hit another record high and held above the $90 threshold.On Tuesday, spot silver — which outperformed gold last year with a 150% annual gain — crossed over the $90-an-ounce mark for the first time. It was more than 5.8% higher at $92.03 per ounce by 8:15 a.m. ET on Wednesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silver priceSilver futures for March delivery, meanwhile, were last seen trading at $91.895. Spot prices for the metal are up 27% so far this year and, as the rally continued, equities related to the metal moved higher. In pre-market trade, U.S.-listed shares of Hecla Mining — which owns Greens Creek Mine in Alaska, one of the biggest silver mines in the world — jumped 4.2%. Endeavour Silver was 2.5% higher, while First Majestic Silver was last seen trading up 2.7%. Coeur Mining, the operator of the Rochester mine in Nevada, gained around 2.6%, while Silvercorp Metals and Teck Resources added 3%, and Wheaton Precious Metals gained 1%.Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the silver industry also rallied. The Abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF rose by 6.3% in pre-market trade, while the iShares Silver Trust fund also jumped 6.3%. ProShares' Ultra Silver ETF surged 12.7% higher. Across the Atlantic, London-listed shares of Fresnillo touched a record high and were last seen trading 1.9% higher. The stock was the best performer on London's FTSE 100 index last year, with a gain of 452.5%. Evy Hambro, portfolio manager and the Global Head of Thematics and Sector Investing at BlackRock, told CNBC on Tuesday that although the investment management giant had long been bullish on silver, it had only begun shifting its approach to equities related to the metal in recent years. \"It was only in 2024 that we moved into the [related] equities as prices had risen to levels that allowed the companies to make a decent return,\" he said in an email. \"Prior to this, price moves had more often than not been eaten up by cost increases.\"BlackRock expects silver to continue its upward trajectory this year.\"Our long-term view on silver is positive, but it is important to remember silver is more of an industrial metal [than gold],\" Hambro told CNBC. \"We expect 2026 returns to be driven by how company management teams allocate the increased cashflows. Should there be ongoing discipline, such as massive dividend increases rather than over investment or M&A, this will differentiate miners in 2026.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, told CNBC on Wednesday that underlying factors supporting the silver rally were still at play. \"It's been a whirlwind time for silver and there are reasons why the metal could still shine well into 2026,\" he said in an email. \"Supplies are tight and could get even tighter after China imposed export restrictions on the refined version of the precious metal. That matters because China is a net exporter of silver.\"He also pointed to silver's industrial use as a driver of demand, with the metal being an essential component in goods from solar panels to cell phones.  \"Demand is strong from these areas, and there is a risk that not enough money is being spent by miners on developing new sources of supply,\" Coatsworth said. When it comes to allocating capital to silver, Coatsworth added that investors can gain exposure through funds or shares in miners as well as buying physical silver. \"Buying a fund is a way to get broad exposure and spread your risks, rather than betting everything on a single company,\" he said. \"However, investing in any silver mining company – either directly or through a fund – is higher risk than simply tracking the silver price. You must factor in the risks that operations go wrong, geopolitical risks associated with the location of assets, and unpredictable geology.\"",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Under the current deal, shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer, Faber reported. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added.If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported.The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery's business. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30-per-share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV networks. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan, on January 13, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

That was below the Dow Jones consensus for a 0.3% gain though one-tenth of a percentage point higher than October.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI was flat on the month against expectations for a 0.2% gain.Though the monthly readings were soft, the headline PPI was up 3% from a year ago, well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The core PPI excluding trade services posted a 3.5% annual gain, the biggest 12-month move since March 2025, according to the BLS.A 0.9% gain in goods prices fueled much of the PPI increase, with more than 80% attributable to a 4.6% jump in energy prices. Services prices were flat.On the consumer side, retail sales rose 0.6% for November, according to Commerce Department figures adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales were up 0.5%, compared with the 0.3% estimate.The November gains were broad based, with motor vehicle and parts dealers, building material and garden centers, gas stations, sporting goods stores, and miscellaneous outlets all seeing gains eclipsing 1%. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3.3%, ahead of the 2.7% increase in the consumer price index for that month. The control group, which strips out several categories and feeds into the gross domestic product calculation, rose 0.4%, in line with market consensus. The BLS remains behind schedule in the PPI data due to the government shutdown last year, while the retail sales reports are also lagging.Financial markets reacted little to the data, with stock futures pointing lower and Treasury yields near flat. Traders continued to price in virtually no chance of a Fed rate rate when it meets later this month.",

The pulling forward of freight altered the traditional peak season of shipping container movement in 2025.If the tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are ruled to be illegal by the Supreme Court, imports to the U.S. may rise as companies feel more confident about their cash situation and seek an opening to buffer inventory ahead of any revised tariff plan from the Trump administration, which officials said will be ready to go and accomplish its existing trade goals.\"If the IEPPA tariffs were to be removed from all imported goods, there would certainly be an increase in imports,\" said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics. \"Especially for goods recently being sourced in higher-tariffed countries,\" he said.The Supreme Court issued three decisions on Wednesday morning, but the tariffs case was not among them.While Trump's trade war hasn't slowed Chinese trade with other nations — it just reported a record $1.2 trillion trade surplus — global ocean container volumes to the U.S. tracked by SONAR show a 14% decrease year over year. The higher tariffs forced some businesses to run with leaner inventories, with the drop in Chinese trade the most severe. Project44's January Tariff Report estimates U.S. imports from China fell 28 percent year-over-year, while exports to China dropped 38 percent in 2025. \"This marked one of the sharpest bilateral trade contractions in recent history,\" Project44 noted in its report.The Supreme Court decision comes at a critical time of year for supply chain management decisions within companies because factories shut down in China for a month in February for the Lunar New Year. Orders for the delivery of spring and summer freight need to be placed early to ensure the products leave the factories to be delivered in time to the U.S. The time frame for companies to place manufacturing orders for Lunar New Year is typically at the end of December or the beginning of January, to avoid the slowdown in production of their imports. According to SEKO Logistics, the production slowdown begins three to four weeks before Lunar New Year, as workers begin to start leaving the factories to head home. This year, the Lunar New Year falls between February 17 and March 3. \"If the Supreme Court does rule the tariffs illegal, this will absolutely impact orders with an increased demand for bookings for three reasons,\" said Brian Bourke, chief commercial officer for SEKO Logistics. \"First, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday. Second, we fully expect other tariff provisions to be used, but there are limits and implementation timelines that will encourage companies to 'beat the clock' again, and third is the expected infusion of future cash to fund these purchases.\"  If the tariffs are ruled illegal, the Court of International Trade has the legal authority to require refunds are paid to U.S. importers and retain jurisdiction over claims for refunds for a two-year statute of limitations period. At the same time, the Trump administration has said if the Supreme Court rules against it, there is already a plan in place to implement tariffs using other legal provisions.Smaller companies would be expected to act first. \"Small and medium-sized businesses must start ordering early compared to the larger businesses because of their planning and smaller staff,\" said Eytan Buchman, CMO of Freightos. \"The tariffs are sucking the life out of them because of the lack of stability in their supply chain planning. There is too much uncertainty.\" Based on its analysis covering five years of Lunar New Year ordering data, Freightos would expect a surge of orders from small and medium-sized businesses to kick in very soon if a ruling against Trump's tariffs is issued. \"Normally, we see a massive spike in importer activity three to four weeks ahead of Chinese New Year,\" said Buchman. \"This means U.S. small and medium-sized businesses have until January 20 to plan their shipment.\"A recent survey from Freightos indicates that small and medium-sized businesses won't all necessarily begin resourcing from China. Respondents said if the tariffs were ruled illegal by the Supreme Court, they would broaden their global sourcing base and evaluate high-quality, lower-cost suppliers in new regions without tariff-related cost penalties. Others mentioned they would move production back to China.watch nowA recent CNBC Supply Chain survey showed there was no bump in additional orders from China in November or December after a trade truce between the two nations was announced on October 30, despite expectations by logistics managers there could be a surge in new orders. The current situation of lean inventories within the U.S. supply chain can be seen clearly in trade data after the holidays. Warehouse inventories tracked on the Logistic Managers' Index show a strong contraction in warehouse inventories by 17.4% month over month.\"Right now, there is a certain amount of defeatism because they feel worse off than a year ago. They want to be able to plan their supply chain,\" Buchman said. But not all players within the supply chain are convinced that the Court's decision will be a major swing factor in trade volumes to the U.S. IMC Logistics tells CNBC it is seeing strong volumes from Asia to the West Coast and does not foresee a decline in volumes as retailers, manufacturers, and wholesalers are actively restocking after a robust holiday season. \"Import volumes have continued to demonstrate strength through the end of the year and into January 2026,\" said Brian Kobza, IMC's chief commercial officer. Kobza added that because of the time it takes for orders to be made and then travel across the ocean, any impact on higher container volumes would not be seen for roughly 45 days. \"We do not believe the ruling will impact total import volumes either way based on how trade reacted in 2025,\" he said.\"If the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, there may be a small bump, but nothing dramatic appears to be coming,\" said Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA.  watch now",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.watch now",

    "body": "The Shell gas station logo is displayed on February 13, 2025 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesDutch group Follow This on Wednesday launched a newly revised strategy to take on Big Oil at the upcoming proxy season, seeking to increase shareholder pressure on the financial sustainability of fossil fuel business models. The prominent climate activist group, which paused filing shareholder resolutions last year due to a lack of investor appetite, said it will change tack to focus on the financial risks associated with declining oil and gas demand — rather than requesting emission reduction targets.The pivot comes as oil and gas majors double down on hydrocarbons and scale back green energy investments as part of a push to boost profit.Alongside 23 institutional investors with 1.5 trillion euros ($1.75 trillion) in assets under management, Follow This said it has co-filed new shareholder resolutions for the Annual General Meetings (AGMs) of Britain's Shell and BP. The resolutions request that both London-listed companies disclose strategies for creating shareholder value under scenarios of falling oil and gas demand, including under the International Energy Agency's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). Read more\"Every investor in his right mind knows — even BlackRock knows — that climate change is threatening their entire portfolio. They all know it, but they don't dare to take action,\" Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, told CNBC by video call.\"We concluded that OK, if we want to increase the pressure on the oil companies to change, we need to raise the votes, and we need to raise an extra talking point into the discussion,\" Van Baal said.\"They are only going to change if their business model is not profitable anymore, if their license to operate is gone, or if their shareholders steer them in a different direction. We have always been working on the shareholder lever.\"In response, a spokesperson for Shell said: \"As with any resolution that meets the procedural requirements, the Board will consider it and respond with a recommendation to shareholders in our Notice of Meeting for the AGM.\"BP did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.A fuel pump is seen connected to a car at a gas station in Krakow, Poland on June 19, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesFollow This, which has previously achieved majority investor backing, has seen support plateau at around 20% in recent years, partly due to concerns about legal risks, particularly in the U.S.It says a change of approach is necessary, given that many investors remain wary about supporting climate-labelled resolutions. Financial risk, by contrast, is an issue boards cannot dismiss as non-financial, Follow This said. \"Everybody is hesitant. Politicians are hesitating because we have a climate denying president in the U.S., while in Europe, right-wing politicians are just repeating that message, and the politicians in the middle don't dare to talk about climate much anymore,\" Van Baal said.Climate scientists have repeatedly warned that a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use will be necessary to curb global heating, with the burning of coal, oil, and gas identified as the chief driver of the climate crisis.Green energy projectsFor Shell, which plans to become a net zero company by 2050, Follow This said the shareholder resolution had been co-filed by current and former Shell employees for the first time. It said the resolution includes five current and 19 former Shell employees.\"The board should be transparent about how Shell plans to create value as fossil fuel demand declines,\" said Arjan Keizer, one of the former Shell employees supporting the resolution. He held various roles at the company, including working as the chief strategy officer of Shell's unit formerly called NewMotion.\"Shareholders and employees need this information to make informed decisions about whether to stay or to go.\"watch nowShell and BP have both watered down their plans to invest in green energy projects in recent years, favoring a renewed focus on their core hydrocarbon businesses. Speaking to CNBC last year, Shell CEO Wael Sawan said gas and liquified natural gas (LNG) will be critical to the energy transition, adding that the biggest contribution the firm can make is through its LNG sales.The firm expects global demand for LNG to rise by around 60% by 2040, largely driven by economic growth in Asia and emissions reductions in heavy industry, among other factors.  'Vital transparency'BP, which became the first oil major to announce a commitment to become a net zero company by 2050, recently announced the appointment of its fourth CEO in six years.The company said Meg O'Neill, who currently serves as CEO of Australian gas giant Woodside Energy, will assume the role as BP chief executive from April 1, taking the reins from Murray Auchincloss.\"Shareholders are rightly requesting vital transparency from BP on its long-term business strategy,\" said Sara E. Murphy, director of system-level investing at the Sierra Club Foundation, one of the co-filing investors.\"Multiple trusted analysts, including the IEA's STEPS and APS scenarios, project a decline in oil and gas demand. BP's current strategy, which assumes growth, thus warrants serious investor concern,\" they added.BP announced a green strategy U-turn in February last year, pledging to slash renewable spending and ramp up annual expenditure on its core business of oil and gas. The move, which was broadly welcomed by energy analysts, included plans to reach $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027. As part of this push, BP said last month that it had agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion.",

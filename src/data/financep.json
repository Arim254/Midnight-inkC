    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Today, Dick Van Dyke is officially 100 years old. Born on Dec. 13, 1925, the \"Mary Poppins\" actor took Hollywood by storm with his singing and dancing, and became an Emmy, Grammy and Tony award-winning legend. Now, Van Dyke has earned a new title: centenarian. Over the course of his life, the performer has shared the practices he follows to stay in the best of health.\"When you reach 100, a lot of things don't work too well,\" Van Dyke told The New York Times last month. But \"sometimes I feel like I'm 15 again.\"In his recent book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" published last month, Van Dyke explores his secrets for longevity even further. Here are three research-backed staples in his routine that he credits for his 100 years of life. How Dick Van Dyke stays active at 100, and his tips for a long, healthy life1. He moves his body oftenEven at 100, Van Dyke goes to the gym three times a week, he told the New York Times. When he makes his way to each machine, sometimes he dances as he walks, he said.On his off days from the gym, he practices yoga and stretches. Van Dyke said his doctors are amazed at how he's still able to touch his toes.Similar to Van Dyke, many Japanese centenarians — particularly in the blue zone, Okinawa, Japan — start their mornings with exercise. Typically they do a low-intensity workout that airs on the radio, called radio taiso, which is about three minutes long. The exercise also promotes a sense of community because participants tend to practice it alongside friends, colleagues or family.2. He has an optimistic outlook and doesn't turn down opportunities that excite him\"I've decided people are born with a certain personality and a certain outlook, a certain perspective,\" Van Dyke said in a sit-down interview with Al Roker for the TODAY show this November. \"I tend to look on the good side of things.\"Keeping a sense of playfulness in his life helps him experience a lot more fun, he said in his interview with The New York Times. Just last year, Van Dyke starred in Coldplay's music video for the song \"All My Love.\"In the Directors' Cut version of the video, Van Dyke spoke about how his career aligned with his desire to remain a kid at heart. He said he's \"one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\"Often, the happiest centenarians pursue jobs that are fulfilling to them and don't retire. \"Think how lucky I am,\" he said. \"I got to do what I do — play and act silly.\"3. He values quality time with loved onesTowards the end of the \"All My Love\" music video, Van Dyke welcomes his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren into frame to dance with him. The scene is a symbol of just how much he treasures spending time with his loved ones.Van Dyke is always looking for ways to get his grandchildren and great-grandchildren to enjoy their time at his house, so they want to come back and visit, he told The New York Times. He wants his backyard to resemble a theme park, and mentioned that he's planning to add a zip line next.\"Just hearing them all out there squealing gives me such joy,\" Van Dyke said.A decades-long study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that the key to happiness and longevity is social fitness, or maintaining healthy, long-lasting interpersonal connections.As far as his plans for his birthday today, Van Dyke's itinerary is very relaxed when squared with the major accomplishment of turning 100. Still, it aligns with spending quality time.\"He doesn't want to do anything,\" his wife Arlene Silver told People last week. \"He wants to be in his room watching Jeopardy! reruns with me.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has unveiled the final tally for her 2025 charitable donations, which totaled $7.17 billion in gifts to roughly 225 organizations, she wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday.\"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,\" Scott wrote.Scott's 2025 giving brings her total donation amount since 2019 to $26.3 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. This year's donations went to a wide range of nonprofits including several historically Black colleges and universities, and organizations focused on issues including poverty, social injustice and climate change.Scott's updated philanthropic tally puts her behind only fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving, according to Forbes. Forbes still estimates a $29.9 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world's wealthiest women following her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyFollowing her divorce, Scott signed The Giving Pledge, committing to giving away the bulk of her wealth in her lifetime. She tasked a team of advisors with helping her step up her philanthropic giving by identifying \"organizations with strong leadership teams and results\" across a wide range of areas of societal need, she wrote in a 2020 blog post.Specifically, she wanted to pay \"special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital,\" she wrote.In her Tuesday essay, Scott wrote about putting her giving into perspective, citing data from Giving USA, which reported in June that Americans donated more than $590 billion in charitable giving in 2024. Much of the country's philanthropy — whether monetary or otherwise — happens on a relatively small scale, Scott wrote.\"Over 70% of Americans reported giving both labor and money to people they know, and half reported doing the same for strangers,\" wrote Scott, adding: \"It's easy to focus on the methods of civic participation that make news, and hard to imagine the importance of the things we do each day with our own minds and hearts.\"Scott mentioned multiple examples of generosity she received before she became wealthy, helping inspire her more recent philanthropy. She wrote about a \"local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college,\" and her college roommate at Princeton University \"who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.\"That roommate, Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, went on to found Funding U, a student lender that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a co-signer, Scott noted.Scott highlighted those examples while encouraging civic participation in myriad forms, from financial gifts to random acts of kindness: \"Respect, understanding, insight, empathy, forgiveness, inspiration – all of these are meaningful contributions to others.\"Scott's blog post did not break down how or why she chose any of the hundreds of organizations she supported in 2025. A long-standing aspect of her giving does stand out in contrast to many other billionaire philanthropists: Her donations typically come without any strings, meaning organizations are free to use the money however they see fit.Her goal has been to \"de-emphasize privileged voices\" like her own, \"and cede focus to others,\" she wrote in a 2021 blog post.\"People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,\" Scott wrote in that post. \"This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

Its capabilities in complex portfolio management across both public and private markets include structured products, private credit, and derivatives.Stock Market Value: $6.37 billion ($21.76 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconClearwater Analytics Holdings shares year to date.Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: ~4.9%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 59 prior information technology companies and their average return on these situations is 36.92% versus an average of 20.01% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Additionally, Starboard has taken a total of 163 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.26% versus 14.34% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Dec. 9, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Clearwater Analytics and is urging the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers.Behind the scenesClearwater Analytics is a provider of front-to-back, cloud-based investment accounting solutions. The company has steadily taken share from legacy solutions, such as BlackRock, State Street and SS&C, as they are widely viewed as the premium modern platform. In 2016, private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe became the majority investor in the company. In 2020, Warburg Pincus and Permira made minority investments, and, about a year later, these three firms took the company public at $18 per share. Clearwater performed fairly well from its IPO through 2024, supported by consistent growth and historically strong margins that drove a premium valuation relative to peers, and these sponsors were rewarded accordingly. Warburg and Permira, which owned 22%, each sold their positions entirely and WCAS, which owned 56%, reduced its stake to roughly 1% by November 2024, at prices as high as $29.11 per share.Shortly thereafter, the company started making a string of acquisitions — a public company, Enfusion, and two private businesses, Beacon and Bistro. All of these transactions were announced between January and March of this year and closed within the following few months. The consequence of this is that Clearwater shifted from being a clean high-growth vertical software story with strong margins, a premium valuation, and a net cash balance, to a riskier, less certain integration story with leverage around 3x EBITDA. Unsurprisingly, the market questioned the company's decision to change course so sharply as well as its ability to integrate these three acquisitions while continuing to maintain its core organic growth story, and the stock sold off sharply, ultimately reaching a low of $15.73 per share after its third-quarter earnings report last month. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Clearwater had engaged advisers to evaluate strategic options after receiving a bevy of unsolicited offers from firms like Thoma Bravo and even Warburg Pincus and Permira, both of whom still had representatives on the board. These announcements prompted Starboard to disclose its nearly 5% position in Clearwater and urge the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers. But don't misunderstand Starboard's motive or thesis. They are not short-term strategic investors jumping on an opportunity for a quick return. They have likely been looking at Clearwater for many months and had owned it because they like the standalone story and see an opportunity to create long term value. But, to paraphrase the overused quote attributed to Mike Tyson (but really said by Cus D'Amato), everyone has a plan until they get hit. And Starboard is as good as anyone with rolling with the punches. So, when news surfaces that the company is considering a sale and that two of its board members may be bidders, Starboard is doing what any good activist would do and making sure there is a fair process to maximize value for shareholders. Starboard will then decide whether that price is better than the risk adjusted value shareholders could receive from a standalone plan of integrating the acquisitions and growing the core business. Moreover, a credible and fair process could likely attract additional bidders, including strategics such as BlackRock and Nasdaq. While the leveraged buyout math works in the high $20s per share, strategics could push it to a 3 handle.  There could be a quick resolution here if the board decides to sell to the company and receives a bid that is good for everyone. But that is a risky activist thesis on its own. What makes this a good activist campaign for Starboard is that they are a believer in the company as a standalone entity and see a path to create shareholder value. If the standalone path is ultimately pursued, it would make a lot of sense for the private equity investors who no longer own any material position to resign from the board and be replaced with industry experts and a shareholder representative who can guide management through a standalone plan. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes to Clearwater's current inflection point: (i) a standalone plan where the company integrates its acquisitions and grows its core; (ii) a sale of the company for a satisfactory premium following a real and competitive review process; or (iii) an abbreviated sale process orchestrated in part by Warburg and Permira resulting in a sale to Warburg and Permira. Starboard would likely be happy with (i) or (ii) and we expect them to do everything within their power to prevent (iii).Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people.

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing.

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk appears on a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle on Friday pushed back against a report that said the company will complete data centers for OpenAI, one of its major customers, in 2028, rather than 2027.The delay is due to a shortage of labor and materials, according to the Friday report from Bloomberg, which cited unnamed people. Oracle shares closed down more than 4% on Friday. \"Site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI following execution of the agreement and were jointly agreed,\" an Oracle spokesperson said in an email to CNBC. \"There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track.\"The Oracle spokesperson did not specify a timeline for turning on cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. In September, OpenAI said it had a partnership with Oracle worth more than $300 billion over the next five years. \"We have a good relationship with OpenAI,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two newly appointed CEOs, said at an October analyst meeting.Doing business with OpenAI is relatively new to 48-year-old Oracle. Historically, Oracle grew through sales of its database software and business applications. Its cloud infrastructure business now contributes over one-fourth of revenue, although Oracle remains a smaller hyperscaler than Amazon, Microsoft and Google. OpenAI has also made commitments to other companies as it looks to meet expected capacity needs. In September, Nvidia said it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia equipment for the San Francisco artificial intelligence startup. The first phase of that project is expected in the second half of 2026.Nvidia and OpenAI said in a September statement that they \"look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.\"But no announcement has come yet.In a November filing, Nvidia said \"there is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity.\"OpenAI has historically relied on Nvidia graphics processing units to operate ChatGPT and other products, and now it's also looking at designing custom chips in a collaboration with Broadcom. On Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out a timeline for the OpenAI work, which was announced in October. Broadcom and OpenAI said they had signed a term sheet.\"It's more like 2027, 2028, 2029, 10 gigawatts, that was the OpenAI discussion,\" Tan said on Broadcom's earnings call. \"And that's, I call it, an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed with respect to a very respected and valued customer, OpenAI. But we do not expect much in 2026.\"OpenAI declined to comment.WATCH: Oracle says there have been 'no delays' in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

The firm did so on the tech announcements and potential for future licensing deals, as well as higher-than-consensus expectations on deliveries next year of the company's new midsize R2 SUV.Read more\"RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,\" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said in a Friday investor note.The company's stock had ramped up heading into the AI Day, but many analysts believed the announcements from the event were already \"priced in.\" Shares also fell as OpenAI made its own AI announcement Thursday, revealing its most advanced model yet.\"We attended Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said Friday in an investor note. \"However, the stock's weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.\"Rivian's announcements included a proprietary chip, RAP1, designed for \"physical AI,\" namely autonomous driving; an evolved software architecture, or \"brains\" of the vehicle; a new AI assistant; and a road map for getting to \"personal L4,\" or fully self-driving personally owned vehicles.The latter begins later this month with an update involving its hands-free driving system, followed by plans to continue to expand capabilities until vehicles reach full autonomy in the years ahead. Rivian did not disclose a time frame for the full autonomy or potential robotaxi fleet autonomous vehicles.watch nowLeading up to the event, Rivian shares were up more than 30% to $17.50. Despite those gains, shares remain well off the levels of the company's IPO of $78 per share in 2021.Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said while Rivian's technology announcements, including the surprise proprietary chip, were impressive, the company remains a \"show me\" story amid more challenging market conditions.\"With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,\" Levy said Friday in an investor note. \"To be clear, there is certainly a 'show me' element for RIVN on its capabilities.\"Challenges include slumping EV demand following the end of up to $7,500 tax credits in September, lack of other support under the Trump administration and internal struggles at the company involving products and capital.Several analysts noted the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems remains low across the industry, even at U.S. EV leader Tesla, and Rivian is continuing to play catch-up to other companies that have offered such systems for years.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of \"pure EV\" plays Tesla, Rivian and Lucid in 2025.Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and other executives argued that the company's vertical integration of in-house capabilities including software, AI, vehicle platforms and other technologies will enable the automaker to be more efficient, quicker and better than others.\"AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we've seen in the past,\" Scaringe said during the event.Such arguments, as well as the automaker's prior $5.8 billion joint venture software deal with Volkswagen, have led Wall Street to price Rivian's software business higher than its core of producing and selling EVs, given market conditions.A $12 price target for Rivian shares from Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company to underweight, includes $7 for software and services and $5 for its core automotive business. Several analysts added that Rivian might be able to license or sell its newest technologies, including chips.\"RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,\" Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco said in a Friday note. Morgan Stanley raised concerns about autonomy adoption rates, lackluster EV demand ahead of Rivian's new \"R2\" vehicle next year and a prolonged path to profitability as reasoning for the rating confirmation.Rivian R2 is showcased at the company's first Autonomy and AI Day showcasing developments in self-driving technology, in Palo Alto, California, Dec. 11, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersRBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: \"The advancements enhance Rivian's product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.\"Rivian continues to lose billions of dollars annually, despite significant cost reductions and gains in software revenue thanks to its deal with VW. Rivian ended the third quarter with $7.7 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Scaringe has said position the company \"really well\" for the R2 launch.The R2 midsize SUV is crucial for Rivian — especially since it's a major market in the U.S. With expectations of a $45,000 starting price, it is anticipated to broaden Rivian's customer base and be a proof-point for the company's efforts regarding profitability and cost savings. Rivian's current R1 pickup truck and SUV consumer models start at more than $70,000. It also builds electric delivery vans, largely for its biggest shareholder, Amazon, that start at around $80,000.\"Profitability pressure will likely intensify as Rivian rolls out its ~$45K R2 platform in the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment,\" Narayan said. \"While targeting a lower price point could increase market reach, the R1 platform's struggles with profitability despite being nearly double the price of the R2 raise.\"Shares of Rivian, with a $22.5 billion market cap, are rated hold with a $15.43 per share price target, according to average ratings and estimates compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo star in Season 5 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: NetflixThe original concept for what would become \"Stranger Things\" was rejected by more than 15 studios before landing a spot on Netflix's roster of original programming. A decade later, the show created, written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer has become one of the biggest cultural touchstones of the streaming era and has solidified Netflix as not just a competitor, but a leader in the space.\"People always talk about Netflix and [say] our big moment was when we'd put on 'House of Cards,' and that was a big deal. But our real moment was when we put on 'Stranger Things,'\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles last month.\"'House of Cards' was great. It kind of told the world that we're going to make some really good TV shows,\" he continued. \"But with 'Stranger Things,' this was a lot closer to a 'Star Wars' moment. This is a show, characters that move the culture, that spawned live events and consumer products and spinoffs and sequels.\"The final bowReleased in 2016, \"Stranger Things\" is set in the '80s and centers on a group of middle schoolers in a fictional rural town in Indiana who must navigate paranormal and supernatural occurrences following the disappearance of their friend. In the mix is a young girl with psychokinetic powers who has escaped from a secret research lab, an alcoholic police chief who is trying to find the missing boy and a frantic mother.Now, almost a decade later, the fifth and final season is making its staggered debut on Netflix.An advertisement for \"Stranger Things\" on one of Netflix's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Dec. 2, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersVolume 1, which consists of the first four episodes, debuted over the Thanksgiving holiday and amassed 59.6 million views in the first five days, the biggest premiere week for an English-language series on Netflix. It ranks third overall behind Season 2 and Season 3 of the Korean series \"Squid Game.\"In its second week on the platform, Volume 1 generated another 23.6 million views, topping the streamer's weekly charts, and each of the previous four seasons saw week-over-week viewership bumps, as fans rewatched prior episodes, Netflix reported.Volume 2 of \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which contains three episodes, arrives on Christmas, and the finale episode, which has a run time of a little over two hours, is set for New Year's Eve. The finale will be available for viewing in select theaters New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In a break with tradition, Netflix will not be selling tickets for these screenings. Instead, more than 500 domestic cinemas will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee seating for the showings. These vouchers can be used toward purchases of food and beverages at the venues. Furthermore, theater owners will keep all revenue from these purchases.Netflix and exhibitors have tangled in the past over release terms, as the streamer does not commit to a prolonged run in theaters for movies that it wants to be eligible for awards contention. \"Nothing would make us happier than to play Netflix theatrical movies in our theaters,\" AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement earlier this month. \"We think that could be beneficial for all involved. But as we need to treat our existing studio partners fairly, there is much that still needs to be sorted out to that end. Even so, there is progress.\"Turning culture upside down\"Stranger Things\" has brought about a renaissance of the 1980s, reviving fashion trends, music and even discontinued food brands for a new generation.When the series debuted, Netflix partnered with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like, but it was predominantly working with licensees. This means it was collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.In 2019, the company launched its own consumer products division and two years later its own officially licensed online shop.Coinciding with the launch of the final season of \"Stranger Things,\" Netflix announced dozens of partnerships and collaborations with brands across the merchandise, retail and restaurant spectrum. The streamer has tapped Lego, Funko, Squishmallows, Hasbro, Jazwares and Care Bears to bring \"Stranger Things\" toys and collectibles to fans of the series. It has apparel and lifestyle deals with Gap, Nike, Crocs, CoverGirl, Zara and Wrangler, among others, and food and beverage collaborations with the likes of Eggo, Doritos, Kellogg, Gatorade and Starbucks.Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: Netflix\"We are incredibly excited to partner with so many fantastic brands, offering fans — and fellow nerds — the largest collection of products and experiences in 'Stranger Things' history and one of our biggest campaigns yet as we celebrate the fifth and final season of this globally beloved series,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, in a statement earlier this month.Outside the retail space, Netflix has delved into the live event space, bringing \"Stranger Things\" to life through an immersive experience that enables fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. There is also a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which has been running in the West End in London since 2023 and in New York since this spring.In addition, Netflix has a deal with Epic Games that has brought \"Stranger Things\" items to the popular online video game Fortnite. Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is more than a way for the company to generate revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels, industry experts said.The cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" Season 5.Courtesy: NetflixThis playbook is not unique to Netflix, but it showcases the maturation of the streaming service. \"Strangers Things\" is less of a blueprint that can be adopted by every Netflix show or film, but rather a gold standard for what is possible.\"[Netflix] had a few good shows early on ('Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards'), but it took a couple of years of whiffs before they came up with 'Stranger Things,'\" Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush, told CNBC via email. \"They have had a ton of success since, with shows like 'Squid Game' and 'Bridgerton,' but it was questionable if they could settle on a formula for coming up with original IP.\"'Stranger Things' has remained a solid IP throughout, and has driven a lot of recognition,\" he added.",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersBroadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter. The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4.5% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 5%, respectively. AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.69%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1%. The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.\"This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,\" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"We would be buyers on this pullback.\"Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It closed on Friday just below $360. \"This is still where the growth is,\" Rakesh said. \"They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta, to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.\" Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.watch nowCEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher up-front costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks. Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, \"We do not expect much in '26.\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that \"AI angst\" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.\"Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,\" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note. Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt. CoreWeave, which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 10% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

    "body": "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further.\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today,\" the central banker said during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory.\"Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. He was joined by Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, as well as Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a steeper cut.While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now.Recent readings show the annual inflation rate around 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% target.\"There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress,\" Goolsbee said. \"Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in.\"\"While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further,\" the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website.Goolsbee will not be a voter on the FOMC in 2026 but will still participate in meetings.\"Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information.\" he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website. In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be \"pretty stable.\"\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today. But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts,\" he said in the interview. \"We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation.\"The FOMC on Wednesday voted to lower its benchmark rate to a range between 3.5%-3.75%. In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months.For his part, Goolsbee said he is \"one of the most optimistic people\" that rates will be lower in the year ahead.Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October.\"Inflation remains too high, the economy shows continued momentum, and the labor market—though cooling—remains largely in balance,\" Schmid said. \"I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. With this assessment, my preference was to leave the target range for the policy rate unchanged at this week's meeting.\"Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as \"somewhat restrictive\" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation.Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy \"on a slightly more restrictive stance\" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.In total, six of the 19 participants at the Fed meeting indicated they opposed the cut, though only two were voters.",

    "body": "watch nowGoldman Sachs Asset Management is making a big bet on defined outcome exchange-traded funds — also known as buffer ETFs, which use options to help protect against market losses.This month, Goldman Sachs agreed to buy defined outcome ETF provider Innovator Capital Management for $2 billion. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year.Bryon Lake, co-head of the firm's Third-Party Wealth team, expects the funds to be a major growth engine for the industry.\"We did this deal with Innovator. We've loved that business for years. We've known the founders. We've known the team. We're really excited about this space that they've invented, the defined outcome space,\" he told CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\" \"Defined outcome, in particular, is a very fast and attractive space to us.\"His reasoning: The ETFs solve particular problems for investors.\"They're looking for income. They're looking for downside protection. They're looking for further growth,\" Lake said.Kathmere Capital Management, which has $3.4 billion in assets under management as of late November, invests extensively in ETFs. According to Nick Ryder, the firm's chief investment officer, defined-outcome ETFs are used in some client portfolios as part of a stock strategy built to reduce downside risk. They're used in tandem along with tools like trend-following and covered-call strategies. \"There's both a client demand for these and we also see a role for them in portfolios,\" Ryder said.He added that the ETFs are so attractive because they're geared for investors seeking stock market exposure with a built-in safety net.\"Equities go up, and they go down. Over the long haul, they tend to work their way upwards to the right. But we know as through years of experience... the ride is anything but smooth,\" Ryder said. \"So for us, this category of these risk-managed equity solutions...  plays a role in a portfolio, and that's where our adoption is really driven by.\"",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

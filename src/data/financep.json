    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement after the decision. \"We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.\"The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsFor Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.\"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. \"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\" Moreno continued.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.\"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,\"  Paul posted on X. \"This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.\"The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would require approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision \"a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court.\"\"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,\" Bacon wrote on X. \"In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.\"Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.\"Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. \"I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.\"In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.\"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,\" Horsford posted to X.The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the Supreme Court decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he signed an executive order imposing a new 10% \"global tariff,\" hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping \"reciprocal\" import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.The \"Section 122\" tariffs will take effect \"almost immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.They come on top of the levies that remain intact following the high court's decision, which invalidated the tariffs Trump had imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.At a White House press briefing Friday afternoon, Trump railed against the \"deeply disappointing\" 6-3 ruling.\"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" Trump said.The ruling threw out the legal underpinning for many of the tariffs that Trump insists are essential for the U.S. economy and for rebuilding America's shrinking manufacturing base.Trump's reciprocal tariffs and his drug-trafficking-related duties both hinged on his administration's expansive interpretation of IEEPA. But the court's majority ruled Friday that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\"The new 10% global tariffs, which come with a 150-day time limit, will effectively replace the IEEPA duties, a White House official told CNBC later Friday.That could mean lower U.S. tariff rates for some of the countries that had either struck trade deals with the Trump administration, or were in ongoing trade talks.That's because many of those countries and regions had faced U.S. tariffs higher than 10% as part of those agreements. The European Union, for example, agreed to a 15% tariff as part of its trade deal with the U.S. Those tariffs were largely implemented under IEEPA, meaning they were invalidated as a result of the Supreme Court's ruling.The shake-up could be significant for China, which faced two sets of 10% IEEPA-based U.S. tariffs in addition to a 25% duty that remains in effect. Those IEEPA tariffs will be replaced by Trump's new global tariff, bringing China's total rate of 35%, the White House official told CNBC.Trump was adamant that he will find other ways to impose tariffs without Congress. And the White House official noted that as the administration works through additional legal tariff pathways, the rates imposed on individual countries may snap back to their higher levels.When asked at Friday's press briefing why he did not want to work with the legislative branch, Trump said, \"I don't have to. I have the right to do tariffs.\"Trump's remarks vacillated between defiant and scathing. He even went after Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated, after they voted with the majority.\"I think their decision was terrible,\" Trump said. \"I think it's an embarrassment to their families, you want to know the truth. The two of them.\" The new tariff order invokes Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs created using that statute can last for only 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval.Asked at the press briefing about that time limit and about getting congressional buy-in, Trump said, \"We have the right to do pretty much what we want to do.\"Trump also declared that all the tariffs active under statutes known as Section 232 and Section 301 will remain \"in full force and effect.\"Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsThe Trump administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into possible unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, Trump said.Most of the U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.\"Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected,\" Trump said Friday.\"We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it,\" he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas shortly after Trump, said that the administration will replace the rejected IEEPA tariffs by leveraging a number of other existing tariff laws.Doing so \"will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026,\" Bessent said. \"No one should expect that the tariff revenue will go down.\"— CNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this report.",

Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. \"Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer,\" Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. \"It's about meeting them where they already shop.\"The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. Heaf recently laid out his \"plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth.\" He calls it a \"consumer-first formula\" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products; reigniting the brand; winning in the marketplace; and operating with speed and efficiency.The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, \"is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy.\"Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. Now, Heaf says, the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.Amazon: Friend or foe? While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. Gap, J.Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. Gap began selling what it calls \"core basics for the whole family\" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for \"core essentials.\" Under Bath & Body Works' new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J.Crew did not respond to request for comment.Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision-making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. Still, Heaf admits, \"We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon.\"",

    "body": "Blue Owl BDC's CEO Craig Packer speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersThe latest tremor in the private credit world involved a deal that should've been reassuring to markets. Blue Owl, a direct lender specializing in loans to the software industry, said Wednesday it had sold $1.4 billion of its loans to institutional investors at 99.7% of par value. That means sophisticated players scrutinized the loans and the companies involved and felt comfortable paying nearly full price for the debt, a message that Blue Owl co-President Craig Packer sought to convey in interviews several times this week.But instead of calming markets, it sent shares of Blue Owl and other alternative asset managers diving on fears of what could follow. That's because as part of the asset sale, Blue Owl announced it was replacing voluntary quarterly redemptions with mandated \"capital distributions\" funded by future asset sales, earnings or other transactions.\"The optics are bad, even if the loan book is fine,\" Brian Finneran of Truist Securities wrote in commentary circulated Thursday. \"Most investors are interpreting the sales to mean that redemptions accelerated and led to forced sales of higher quality assets to meet requests.\"Blue Owl's move was widely interpreted as the firm halting redemptions from a fund under pressure, even as Packer pointed out investors would get about 30% of their money back by March 31, far more than the 5% allowed under its previous quarterly schedule.\"We're not halting redemptions, we're just changing the form,\" Packer told CNBC on Friday. \"If anything, we're accelerating redemptions.\"watch nowComing amid a broad tech and software selloff fueled by fears of AI disruption, the episode shows that even apparently strong loan books aren't immune to market jitters. This in turn forces alternative lenders to scramble to satisfy shareholders' sudden demands for the return of their money.It also exposed a central tension in private credit: What happens when illiquid assets collide with demands for liquidity?Against a backdrop that was already fragile for private credit since the collapse of auto firms Tricolor and First Brands, the fear that this could be an early sign of credit markets cracking took off. Shares of Blue Owl fell Thursday and Friday. They are down more than 50% in the past year. Early Thursday, the economist and former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian wondered in social media posts whether Blue Owl was a \"canary in the coal mine\" for a future crisis, like the failure of a pair of Bear Stearns credit funds in 2007. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he was \"concerned\" about the possibility that risks from Blue Owl had migrated to the regulated financial system because one of the institutional buyers was an insurance company.Mostly softwareWith skepticism over loans to software firms running high, one question from investors was whether the loans they sold were a representative slice of the total funds, or whether Blue Owl cherry-picked the best loans to sell.The underlying loans were to 128 companies across 27 industries, the largest being software, the firm said.Blue Owl indicated it was a broad swath of overall loans in the funds: \"Each investment to be sold represents a partial amount of each Blue Owl BDC's exposure to the respective portfolio company.\"Despite its efforts to calm markets, Blue Owl finds itself at the nexus of concerns around private credit loans made to software firms.Most of the 200-plus companies Blue Owl lends to are in software; more than 70% of its loans are to that category, executives said Wednesday in a fourth-quarter earnings call. \"We remain enthusiastic proponents of software,\" Packer said on that call. \"Software is an enabling technology that can serve every sector and market and company in the world. It's not a monolith.\"The company makes loans to firms \"with durable moats\" and is protected by the seniority of its loans, meaning that private equity owners would need to be wiped out before Blue Owl saw losses.But, for now at least, the problem Blue Owl faces is one of perception bleeding into reality.\"The market is reacting, and it becomes this self-fulfilling idea, where they get more redemptions, so they have to sell more loans, and that drives the stock down further,\" said Ben Emmons, founder of FedWatch Advisors.",

Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesForty minutes before the federal government revealed that economic growth slowed sharply in the last quarter, President Donald Trump dropped a hint that the incoming data would be weaker.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025. That's a decline of 3 percentage points from the previous three-month period. Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures \"consistent with his 2% Truth this morning.\"In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.The White House at the time admitted that there was an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data\" while attacking the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.\"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\" Trump wrote.He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname \"Too Late\"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.watch now",

    "body": "Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, appears at the Political Opening of the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, on Aug. 23, 2023.Franziska Krug | German Select | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, is leaving the software maker following a 38-year tenure, as the company's Xbox business faces increased challenges.\"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that was published on Friday. \"I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership.\" Spencer's exit follows the departures of business development chief Chris Young and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in 2025. Charlie Bell, who had been Microsoft's most high-ranking security leader, switched to an individual contributor role earlier this month.Revenue from video games at Microsoft declined about 10% in the December quarter from a year earlier, a steeper drop than the company expected, while total revenue grew nearly 17%. Microsoft announced an unspecified impairment charge in its gaming business in January.The company made a $75 billion bet to expand its games business with the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it released Call of Duty titles as a cloud service. But current generation Xbox consoles haven't been as popular as Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Switch, and Microsoft has shuttered studios working on new games.Nadella said in the memo that Spencer, who took charge of Xbox in 2014 after running the company's gaming studios, nearly tripled Microsoft's gaming business, in part through acquisitions like Activision Blizzard. Spencer also pushed for Microsoft to take over Minecraft developer Mojang. \"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Nadella wrote.After Nadella became CEO in 2014, Sony was selling more consoles than Microsoft, and investors had floated the idea of spinning out consumer assets such as Xbox. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Nomura estimated that the division could lose more than $1 billion for the year.\"The question is, do we go forward with Xbox?\" Spencer said in a 2020 interview with gaming website Shacknews. Spencer said he persuaded Nadella to bring hardware, software and game-development groups into one organization.Asha Sharma, who joined Microsoft in 2024 from Instacart, will take over for Spencer, becoming CEO of gaming and reporting to Nadella. Until now, she has been president of product in Microsoft's Core AI business, which former Meta executive Jay Parikh runs. Before arriving at Instacart in 2021 and serving as operating chief, Sharma spent four years as a vice president of product and engineering at Meta and two years in marketing at Microsoft. \"We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,\" Sharma wrote in a message to Microsoft's gaming employees.She has worked on artificial intelligence products such as the Foundry for incorporating AI models into third-party applications. \"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,\" Sharma wrote. \"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\" Sharma said Microsoft will renew its commitment to console gaming. Microsoft's original Xbox came out in 2001.Matt Booty, head of Microsoft's gaming studios, will report to Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.\"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward,\" Nadella wrote.Sarah Bond, president and operating chief of the Xbox unit, will leave Microsoft.\"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand,\" Bond told Xbox employees in a message she also posted to LinkedIn. \"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this.\"Bond and Spencer both said they will advise Sharma on the transition.WATCH: Microsoft is still a buy for the longer term investor, says CFRA's Sam Stovall",

    "body": "watch nowThe retail industry on Friday said the Supreme Court's ruling that struck down some of President Donald Trump's global tariffs would usher in more predictability and free up businesses from the burden of higher import costs. \"The Supreme Court's announcement today regarding tariffs provides much-needed certainty for U.S. businesses and manufacturers, enabling global supply chains to operate without ambiguity,\" the National Retail Federation said in a statement following the ruling. \"Clear and consistent trade policy is essential for economic growth, creating jobs and opportunities for American families.\"The nation's highest court determined that Trump's broad tariff rates on U.S. trade partners enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, overstepped the president's authority. The Supreme Court is sending the case back to the lower court for dismissal.Yet the reversal has raised fresh questions about whether retailers and U.S. consumers will meaningfully feel a financial impact and if the decision means more uncertainty or less.Just hours after the ruling was handed down, Trump condemned the ruling and said his administration has \"alternatives,\" referencing sector-specific tariffs and announcing a new, global tariff rate of 10%. It's also unclear if, when and how the government may refund tariffs that have already been paid and were deemed unconstitutional. \"We urge the lower court to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers,\" the NRF said in its statement. \"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers.\"The NRF represents a number of U.S. retailers, from big-box retailers such as Walmart to smaller brands and manufacturers. In an interview with CNBC on Friday afternoon, David French, executive vice president of government relations for NRF, acknowledged that retailers continue to face other tariffs and may face new ones, based on Trump's remarks. \"The president has lots of other tariff tools in the toolbox ,and we certainly expect he will use these tools to advance his tariff agenda and maintain leverage in negotiations with other countries,\" he said. \"The good thing about the ruling today is it takes one of the tools away from him and will build a little bit more of certainty into the tariff process.\"Compared with Trump's broad use of IEEPA, alternative tariffs that the president imposed on Friday \"have inherit limitations,\" French said. Some of those tariffs would come with time limits or require the administration to clear additional hurdles. And, he said, if companies get a refund of tariffs they paid, they could put it toward investing in their businesses, hiring more workers or lowering prices. He said the trade group is \"hopeful the president comes to the conclusion that getting the refunds out as quickly and as simply as possible would be in everybody's best interest\" — noting it could also help Trump ahead of the midterm elections.In December, warehouse club Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of the tariffs it had paid and to block import duties from continuing. In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco said it risked losing money it has already paid even if the Supreme Court ruled against the tariffs. Costco did not respond to a request for comment about the Supreme Court decision and what it means for the retailer's lawsuit. While Friday's ruling is largely positive for the retail industry, the idea that it brings more predictability and lower costs is likely \"a pipe dream,\" said Steven Shemesh, a retail analyst for RBC Capital Markets. \"This administration is pretty adamant about tariffs and trade balance, and if it doesn't come this way, I'm pretty certain it will come in another way,\" he said prior to Trump's announcement of new tariffs. \"It may have another look, shape, size, smell, but I think it will end up looking similar.\"Apparel and footwear Clothing, footwear and discretionary items were among the imports most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs, which imposed steep rates on countries such as China and Vietnam, where the retail industry maintains large portions of its supply chain. Footwear has been one of the most heavily affected industries, since nearly 100% of all footwear sold in the U.S. is imported, according to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, the industry's trade group.Even before Trump's first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, said Matt Priest, CEO of the FDRA. Yet it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., he said, and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.In an interview with CNBC on Friday, Priest said the decision is a step toward more predictability for the footwear industry because it limits tariffs that Trump can use to ones that \"are not as sweeping\" and may require Congress' input. \"Even if it's still uncertain to some degree, we are not on that playing field where we have those exorbitant tariffs,\" he said.The trade group, which includes well-known footwear companies and brands such as Nike, Crocs and Puma, held an emergency videoconference with 325 companies Friday afternoon. Priest said trade group members were upbeat but also had a lot of questions. Among them, members asked about when or if they would get refunds and when the IEEPA tariffs would officially be stopped, specifically whether they would still hit shipments that arrive in the coming days. Priest said he doesn't anticipate that refunds will come quickly and that the trade group has coached members against banking on them. He said the group's work continues, as it tries to work with the Trump administration and Congress to nudge them toward \"a more surgical, thoughtful approach\" to tariffs. On the call with trade group members, Priest said, \"There was optimism that this part of this journey was at least somewhat being redirected,\" and he described the ruling as \"a win\" for the industry. But, he added, without the refund and other details spelled out yet, \"it's a long way to go.\"",

The social media giant is facing trials in both California and New Mexico that accuse Meta of misleading the public about the safety of apps like Instagram.CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified this week in Los Angeles Superior Court in a trial involving a plaintiff dubbed KGM, who alleges that she became addicted to apps like Instagram and YouTube due to certain design features, thus suffering great mental anguish.Meta is also involved in a separate, ongoing trial in New Mexico where the state's attorney general has alleged that Meta failed to safeguard its apps from online predators.The company has denied the allegations in both of those cases.Meta declined to comment. CNBC has reached out to the National PTA for any additional comment.The National PTA and Meta \"have had a funding relationship since 2017,\" Johnson wrote, saying that the previous agreement ended on Dec. 31, 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsTesla loses bid to toss $243 million verdict in fatal Autopilot crash suitMeta and Apple face serious questions about child safety and privacyFrom 'vanlords' to safe parking sites: How RVs became Silicon Valley's housing safety netWho's laughing now? China's humanoid robots go from viral stumbles to kung fu flips in one yearSharon Winkler, a founding member of child-safety advocacy coalition Parents for Safe Online Spaces, or ParentsSOS, said in a statement that Zuckerberg's testimony showed that the National PTA \"made the right choice to end its partnership.\"\"For years, his company has deliberately addicted children to its social media products,\" Winkler said. \"As a result of Zuckerberg's greed and relentless pursuit of market share, countless children have been harmed, and families like ours have been destroyed.\"ParentsSOS said it also urged the National PTA to \"end its other Big Tech partnerships, including Discord, Google, and TikTok,\" due to child safety and well-being concerns.Those tech companies, and others, are also involved in multiple lawsuits around the country over similar allegations related to the design and features of their respective services that plaintiffs claim pose serious harms to the mental health of young users and compromise their safety.The split comes a few months after the tech watchdog organization Tech Transparency Project published a report detailing the relationship between Meta and the National PTA, which the TTP characterized as part of a broader effort by the social media giant to shape the public narrative on child safety pertaining to apps like Instagram.″As Meta has come under growing pressure over its impact on kids and their well-being, the company has responded with a range of tactics to influence the public debate,\" TTP wrote at the time, as CNBC reported.The National PTA told CNBC in a statement at the time that the organization accepted sponsorship from Meta so the social media giant could have a \"seat at the table\" and be a \"strong, clear voice for parents and children.\"\"Our collaboration with Meta provides an opportunity to help inform families  about safety on its apps and the available tools (e.g., parental  controls, age-gated features) and resources (e.g., parent's guides,  online safety centers),\" the National PTA said at the time.WATCH: Worst outcome in Meta LA trial could bring structural changes to its apps.watch now",

Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe private credit boom is facing a new test after Blue Owl Capital permanently restricted withdrawals from one of its retail-focused debt funds.Shares in Blue Owl Capital fell nearly 6% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds.The biggest portion of the sale came from a semi-liquid private credit fund marketed to U.S. retail investors called the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II, which will stop offering quarterly redemption options to investors, reigniting debate over whether stress was beginning to resurface in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing corners.watch now\"This is a canary in the coal mine,\" Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. \"The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.\"The broader concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves, financing smaller, more leveraged companies at yields that appeared attractive compared with public markets, market watchers said.\"Years of ultra-low rates and ultra-low spreads and very few bankruptcies led investors to go further and further out the risk spectrum in credit,\" Rasmussen said. \"This is a classic case of 'fool's yield,' high yield that doesn't translate into high returns because the borrowers were too risky.\"Private credit, which are generally direct loans made by non-bank lenders to companies, have ballooned into a roughly $3 trillion market globally.When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom.Michael ShumCascade DebtPublicly traded business development companies, or BDCs, which are investment vehicles that lend to small and mid-sized private companies and are a major part of the private credit market, are increasingly funded by retail investors rather than institutions, according to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. The Fuqua research, which was published last September, showed that institutional ownership of BDC shares has steadily declined over time, falling to about 25% on average by 2023.\"This trend indicates that retail investors are playing an increasingly large role in supplying equity capital to publicly traded BDC,\" the researchers pointed out.In 2025, the eight largest members of the S&P BDC Index offered dividend yields which can go up to 16%, with Blue Owl's at over 11%. For comparison, the S&P Global's U.S. high yield corporate bond index 1-year, 3-year and 5-year returns stand at around 7.7%, 9% and 4%, respectively.\"The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans. They are, by their nature, somewhat risky,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\"Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds,\" he added.Rising risks?Private credit concerns recently resurfaced after investors grew uneasy that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software models, a major borrower group of the industry, adding to existing concerns in over rising leverage, murky valuations and the possibility that isolated borrower stress could reveal deeper systemic weaknesses. The First Brands Group collapse last September brought to fore risks in private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were \"hiding in plain sight,\" warning that \"cockroaches\" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.The fundamental problem private market deals have is multi-year commitments that don't line up with quarterly redemptions, said Michael Shum, CEO of Cascade Debt, which builds infrastructure software for private credit and asset-based lenders.\"When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom,\" he said.Blue Owl did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "World leaders during the G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, June 17, 2025.Amber Bracken |ReutersU.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies.The law that undergirds the import duties \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited Supreme Court decision.Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation.A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world\"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,\" the spokesperson said.\"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue.\" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals.The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.watch nowWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move \"does little to clear the murky waters\" for British businesses, warning that the President still has \"other options at his disposal\" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs.  \"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,\" Bain said in a statement. \"For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.\"Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on \"stability and predictability.\" \"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,\" Gill said. \"We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.\"Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"No trade 'win' yetElsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to \"legitimize tariffs,\" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.\"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,\" Swissmem said.\"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,\" Swissmem wrote on X. \"The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.\"The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the \"significant strain\" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.\"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,\" the ICC said.— CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.",

    "body": "Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., during the 60th presidential inauguration in the rotunda of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's tariff bill has racked up about $1 billion per quarter, but that number should start shrinking following the Supreme Court decision on tariffs.The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a large chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy. Apple has paid about $3.3 billion in tariffs since Trump initiated them last year. The iPhone maker's shares rose about 1% on Friday.Friday's decision means Apple could start to see lower production costs and keep more of its margins. The company could also face less pressure to move its production away from China and simplify its supply chain.Apple declined to comment.The large tariff costs stem from U.S. import duties on products and components manufactured overseas — especially from China and other Asian partners, like Vietnam and India.When laying out the plan to handle tariffs in May, CEO Tim Cook said Apple is sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other U.S.-bound products like Macs, AirPods and watches from Vietnam, where tariffs were lower than China's at the time. Friday's decision kills Trump's tariffs on China-made goods, which were at a 47% rate as of December. It also frees Apple up to produce more U.S.-bound products in China, where most of its products to non-U.S. countries have been sourced, instead of diverting to India and Vietnam. On earnings calls, Cook has emphasized that Apple is largely absorbing tariff costs to avoid sudden price jumps for customers. watch nowFriday's ruling means the U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by Trump are illegal.One big question is whether Apple will fight to claw back its tariffs or eat the costs to avoid angering the president.Addressing the SCOTUS decision in a press conference Friday afternoon, Trump did not commit to refunding U.S. companies that paid the tariffs and said he expects multi-year \"litigation\" over paying back the money.The tariffs have tested the relationship between the commander-in-chief and the chief executive of one of the world's most valuable companies.The once-solid relationship between Trump and Cook began breaking down over the idea of a U.S.-made iPhone. In May, Trump said he \"had a little problem with Tim Cook,\" and threatened to slap a 25% tariff on iPhones.Cook went on the charm offensive.In August, he appeared at the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple also committed to purchasing parts and expanding its relationship with U.S. suppliers. Cook presented Trump with a custom, engraved glass plaque featuring a 24-karat gold base.Last month, Cook attended the White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary about first lady Melania Trump.watch nowDespite Friday's ruling, tariffs are still a moving target, leaving many questions about the impact on companies like Apple.Hours after the Supreme Court struck down his reciprocal tariffs, the president said he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% \"global tariff,\" which he's invoking under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval. The administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, the president said.CNBC's Steve Kovach contributed to this report. Read more CNBC tech newsTesla loses bid to toss $243 million verdict in fatal Autopilot crash suitMeta and Apple face serious questions about child safety and privacyFrom 'vanlords' to safe parking sites: How RVs became Silicon Valley's housing safety netWho's laughing now?

    "body": "Julpo | E+ | Getty ImagesThe student loan delinquency rate is surging, new research finds. Nearly 25% of student loan borrowers with a payment due are now behind, compared with around 9% in 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term, according to a report published Friday by The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank.Around 7.9 million student loan borrowers entered delinquency in the first three quarters of 2025 alone, the authors of the study wrote. The foundation used data from the University of California Consumer Credit Panel, a 2% nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with credit records, for its analysis.The researchers said the Trump administration's policies during the president's second term are to blame for the spike in delinquencies.

That plan was designed to be the most affordable repayment plan to date, but faced Republican-led legal challenges and was ultimately blocked in court. For roughly five years, starting with the Covid pandemic, student loan borrowers who missed their payments were also shielded from collection activity and negative credit reporting. That relief is now expired. Around 2 million student loan borrowers with delinquent loans have seen their credit scores fall, with an average drop in score to 580 from 680, the foundation estimates. Credit scores, which impact people's ability and costs to borrow, typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.The Education Department announced last year that it would begin collection activity against defaulted borrowers, but has repeatedly paused those enforcement efforts.The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have likely also exacerbated student loan borrowers' repayment struggles, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. In March, Trump officials terminated thousands of the Education Department's staffers, including many who helped borrowers. The administration has also rolled back the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's enforcement activity and sought to reduce the agency's staff and funding, although many of those actions have been challenged in court. The CFPB oversees student loan servicers and combats abusive practices in the lending space.\"When you get rid of people who help borrowers face financial challenges, is it any surprise that these borrowers encounter problems dealing with debt?\" Kantrowitz said. More than 600,000 federal student loan holders remain in a backlog of applications for an affordable repayment plan, the Education Department disclosed in a recent court filing. More than 86,000 borrowers are waiting for a decision from the department on their student loan forgiveness.Which student loan borrowers are strugglingStudent loan delinquency rates are especially high in several Southern states, according to the Century Foundation's analysis.  In Louisiana and Mississippi, the analysis found, nearly 40% of federal student loan borrowers with payments due are delinquent, the largest shares nationwide. Black borrowers are struggling most, the researchers found.Around 20% of white student loan borrowers were past due in the third quarter of 2025, compared with more than 48% of Black student loan borrowers and around 30% of Hispanic borrowers. Why it could get worse for student loan borrowers Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act's overhaul to the student loan system is likely to make it harder for people to afford their payments, consumer advocates say. The law phases out several affordable repayment plans and lengthens terms for others. The median U.S. household, with a family of four and an income of $81,000, could see its monthly bill surge to $440 from $36, due to the legislative changes, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, a nonprofit organization that promotes college affordability.",

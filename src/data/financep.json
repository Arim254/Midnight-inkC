    "body": "President Donald Trump announced the creation of government-sponsored investment accounts for children under age 18 as part of the sweeping budget bill he signed into law on July 4, 2025. The so-called \"Trump accounts\" are set to become available on July 4, 2026, and parents of U.S. citizens born from 2025 through 2028 will be able to opt-in for an initial deposit of $1,000 from the federal government.Michael Dell, billionaire CEO of tech company Dell, and his wife, Susan, on Dec. 2 pledged a donation of $6.25 billion to provide an initial deposit of $250 to children ages 10 and under in certain ZIP codes when their families open an account on their behalf. Though Trump accounts are not explicitly designed for college savings, they will have similar benefits to 529 college savings plans. For example, Trump account beneficiaries may be able to use funds in the account for higher education expenses without early withdrawal penalties. However, when the beneficiaries turn 18, the accounts will be transferred into individual retirement accounts subject to IRA rules and tax advantages.Named for a section of the tax code, 529 plans were created in 1996 to help families save for their children's higher education expenses. The plans are state-sponsored investment accounts that can offer tax advantages like state income tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals for qualified expenses.\"Fundamentally, any way that people can save money is good, whether it's the 529 accounts or the Trump accounts or Roth IRAs or [Health Savings Accounts],\" Michael Green, a certified financial planner with Apollon Wealth, tells CNBC Make It. \"They're all good tools. It really comes down to what people are trying to accomplish and what their goal is, what their capacity to save is.\"While several details about Trump accounts are not yet available, the Internal Revenue Service has issued some guidance on how the accounts will function. Here are some of the key differences between Trump accounts and 529 savings plans.",

    "body": "The New York Times building is seen on September 16, 2025 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe New York Times on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging new restrictions on reporters who cover the Pentagon, which the newspaper says violate the U.S Constitution's free press protections.The suit against the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth comes nearly two months after reporters from The Times and other mainstream news outlets, including CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC staged a dramatic walkout of the Pentagon and surrendered their credentials after refusing to comply with the rules. Those outlets have been replaced by reporters who are broadly sympathetic to the Trump administration.The Pentagon in October presented reporters who had desks there a 21-page rulebook that bars journalists from seeking or publishing information that has not been explicitly authorized by the Defense Department, even if the material is unclassified or obtained off Pentagon grounds.Outlets that refused to abide by the rules lost their Pentagon credentials.The Times' lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to block the Pentagon from enforcing the policy, and to declare it unconstitutional. \"The policy, in violation of the First Amendment, seeks to restrict journalists' ability to do what journalists have always done — ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements,\" the suit says.The rules \"deprive the public of vital information about the United States military and its leadership,\" the suit says.The complaint also says that the Defense Department gave itself \"unbridled discretion\" to enforce the rules as it sees fit.Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, who is named as a defendant in the suit, told CNBC that the Defense Department \"is aware of the New York Times lawsuit and [looks] forward to addressing these arguments in court.\" The Times did immediately return a request for comment.The Pentagon's media rules were the latest step in Hegseth's broader push to reshape the press corps. Since arriving at the department in January after a contentious confirmation fight, Hegseth has stripped several national outlets of in-house workspaces, tightened rules on where reporters can move inside the building, and reassigned offices to conservative outlets and pro-Trump media figures willing to sign the agreement.Press-freedom advocates, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, say the Pentagon policy goes beyond past fights over individual White House press badges. Rather than targeting one reporter at a time, they argue, the rules bind the entire press corps — giving the Pentagon broad authority to revoke access based on the stories they pursue.\"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Vice President of Policy Gabe Rottman said in a statement Thursday, after the Times filed its suit.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff delivers the keynote address at the start of the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Oct. 14, 2025.Jessica Christian | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesSalesforce reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates with its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.25 adjusted vs. $2.86 expectedRevenue: $10.26 billion vs. $10.27 billion expectedRevenue increased 8.6% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income increased to $2.09 billion, or $2.19 per share, from $1.53 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the same quarter last year, boosted by a $263 million gain from strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share exclude stock-based compensation.The Tableau data analytics business had a higher mix of cloud services than the company had predicted during the quarter, Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Cloud revenue accrues over time, while on-premises sales for Tableau and other products like MuleSoft are recognized when the agreement is signed. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce called for $3.02 to $3.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $3.04 per share and $10.9 billion in revenue. The guidance implies revenue growth of between 11% and 12%, with about 3 points coming from Informatica, the data management company Salesforce acquired for around $8 billion in November. At the same time, the guidance factors in the continued shift to the cloud for MuleSoft and Tableau, as well as ongoing weakness from marketing and commerce products, Washington said.Salesforce's stock has badly underperformed the broader tech sector this year, due in part to concerns about the potential of artificial intelligence replacing some of its product capabilities. As of Wednesday's close, the shares are down 29% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained about 21%.During the third quarter, Salesforce acquired Regrello, whose AI software performs tasks, and Waii, which uses AI to compose code for running queries on data based on a few words of human input. The company also introduced Agentforce AI software for managing IT service requests, and issued a $60 billion fiscal 2030 revenue target, surpassing analysts' projections.Annualized revenue from Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, jumped 330% from a year earlier to over $500 million. Salesforce said it has won over 9,500 paid deals to date, up from over 6,000 as of September.Free cash flow grew 22% to $2.18 billion, but the total was below StreetAccount's $2.24 billion consensus.WATCH: Cramer's Stop Trading: Salesforcewatch now",

    "body": "Refreshed versions of the Tesla Model Y are shown outside a Tesla store in San Diego, California, U.S. October 21, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — U.S. electric vehicle sales leader Tesla made notable strides in Consumer Reports' influential annual auto brand rankings, cracking the top 10 overall for the U.S.The EV manufacturer jumped from No. 18 on last year's list of more than 30 automotive brands to 10th on the 2026 Consumer Reports Brand Report Card, which was released Thursday.\"They definitely have their struggles, but by continuing to refine and not make huge changes in their models, they're able to make more reliable vehicles, and they've moved up our rankings,\" Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing for Consumer Reports, told CNBC.The annual auto brand report card is based on Consumer Reports' testing as well as reliability, safety and overall customer satisfaction according to owner surveys.The surveys do not reflect broader consumer sentiment about the models or automakers ranked by CR outside of customer satisfaction. Tesla has faced a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk in response to his work with the Trump administration and endorsements of far-right politicians and personalities around the world, including Germany's extreme anti-immigrant party AfD. Fisher said Tesla's gain occurred as its vehicles have become more reliable over time, especially as the company hasn't made significant design changes to many of its vehicles like traditional automakers tend to do. Tesla instead relies on remote, or over-the-air, updates to revise many features on the vehicles. Its powertrain reliability remains a standout among EVs, according to Consumer Reports.The only Tesla model to have a below-average score is the Cybertruck, its newest model that features a host of new technologies such as a 48-volt architecture system and \"steer by wire.\" A Tesla Cybertruck in front of a graffiti mural on Aug. 28, 2024 in Detroit. Michael Wayland / CNBC\"They're definitely improving by keeping with things and refining, but if you look at their 5- to 10-year-old models that are out there, when it comes to reliability, they're dead last of all the brands,\" Fisher said. \"They're able to improve the reliability if they don't make major changes.\"On the other end of report card, Rivian Automotive moved up five spots to No. 26 but remains near the bottom of the rankings. Fisher said Rivian models are the lowest in reliability.Despite Rivian's reliability issues, the brand has the highest owner satisfaction, according to Consumer Reports. Fisher during an Automotive Press Association webinar Thursday said its owners are largely early adopters that are willing to deal with some growing pains likely more than more mainstream consumers would. Brands with good reliability tend to perform well in the overall rankings. Reliability for new 2026 models is predicted based on each model's overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn't been redesigned during that time.Subaru topped the overall 2026 brand list, followed by BMW, Porsche, Honda and Toyota to round out the top five brands. At the bottom of the rankings were Jeep, Land Rover, GMC, Dodge and Alfa Romeo.Ford Motor's Lincoln, the highest-ranked domestic brand, made the biggest jump in this year's rankings, climbing 17 positions to No. 7 due to its reliability scores. Audi dropped the most from last year, falling back 10 spots to No. 16.Traditional U.S. automakers, specifically Stellantis brands, struggled compared with their Asian competition in Consumer Reports' annual brand reliability rankings.Of note, the Ford brand ranked No. 18 in the report card but saw improvement in reliability. The automaker, which has struggled with quality issues and recalls, had its Ford brand rank No. 11 in reliability — its best position in 15 years.GM's top-ranked brand was Cadillac at No. 17, followed by Buick at No. 20, Chevrolet at No. 24 and GMC at 29th.Consumer Reports said hybrid vehicles, which are growing in popularity, continue to stand out over other \"electrified\" vehicles, as well as traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.Of approximately 30 hybrids analyzed by Consumer Reports, only the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Lincoln Nautilus Hybrid and Mazda CX-50 Hybrid have below-average predicted reliability scores.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this article.",

In January, Microsoft announced a price hike for consumer Office bundles.Microsoft offers Office 365 subscriptions for commercial use that include access to its productivity applications, along with higher-priced Microsoft 365 subscriptions that also include Windows operating system updates.Here's a breakdown of the commercial price changes:For small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft 365 Business Basic will cost $7 per person per month, up from $6.Microsoft 365 Business Standard will be available for $14, up from $12.50.Microsoft 365 Business Premium will continue to cost $22.The entry-level Office 365 E1 offering for enterprises will still be sold for $10.Office 365 E3 will jump 13% to $26 from $23.The Microsoft 365 E3 package including Windows for enterprises will rise 8% to $39 from $36.The full-featured Microsoft 365 E5 will increase to $60 from $57.For front-line workers such as cashiers, Microsoft 365 F1 subscriptions will cost $3, up from $2.25.Microsoft 365 F3 will be available for $10, up from $8.The U.S. Defense Department and other government clients will face similar percentage price increases.The various subscriptions all exclude access to the $30 Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on that draws on generative artificial intelligence models. Some companies have started widely rolling out Copilot, while others have held off on expanding their deployments, CNBC reported last week.In many cases, organizations receive discounts off of list prices, but Microsoft has cut back on direct volume deals for some types of customers.Almost 43% of Microsoft's $77.7 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue came from its Productivity and Businesses Processes segment, which includes Office. In October, the company said revenue from Microsoft 365 commercial cloud services jumped 17%, while seats increased 6%, mainly from products targeting small and medium-sized businesses and front-line workers.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

    "body": "File: Then Apple Creative Director Alan Dye celebrates the launch of the July Issue at the new WIRED office on June 24, 2015 in San Francisco, California.Kimberly White | Getty ImagesApple's head of user interface design, Alan Dye, will join Meta, in a notable shift of executive talent in Silicon Valley. The iPhone maker confirmed Dye's departure on Wednesday and Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that the company prioritizes design and has a strong team. The statement said that veteran designer Stephen Lemay will succeed Dye.\"Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,\" Cook said in a statement. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Wednesday social media post said that Dye would lead up a new creative studio that brings together design, fashion and technology. \"We plan to elevate design within Meta,\" wrote Zuckerberg, who did not say what specific products Dye will work on. Compared to other Silicon Valley companies, Apple has always emphasized design to customers and investors as one of its strengths. Apple prominently features its design executives to discuss interface changes at the company's launch events.In June, Dye revealed a redesign of Apple's software interface for iPhones, Macs and the Apple Watch called Liquid Glass. The company described it as an \"elegant\" new design with translucent buttons, updated app icons and fluid animations.  Dye said it was the \"next chapter\" of the company's software and said it \"sets the stage\" for the next era of Apple products. \"Our new design blurs the lines between hardware and software to create an experience that's more delightful than ever while still familiar and easy to use,\" Dye said at the launch. Reviews were mixed on the Liquid Glass update, which shipped with new iPhones in September. Apple announces liquid glass during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, 2025 in Cupertino, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesFor years, Apple design was embodied by executive Jony Ive, who left Apple in 2019 and is now working with OpenAI on artificial intelligence hardware alongside Sam Altman. Dye took over user interface design and became one of the design studio's leads in 2015 when Ive stepped back from a day-to-day role. Dye started at Apple in 2006 and worked on software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was also partly responsible for the first iPhone in 2017 that did away with the home screen button at the bottom of the device and replaced it with a software-based swipe-up motion. Meta has said in recent years that it wants to be a major developer of hardware and Zuckerberg has said Apple is one of his company's biggest competitors. The social media company currently makes several virtual reality headsets under its Quest brand, and recently scored its first hardware hit with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are stylish sunglasses equipped with cameras and the ability to run an AI model that can answer questions. Sales of the device tripled over the past year, Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica said in July. \"We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,\" Zuckerberg wrote.Bloomberg first reported the move.

    "body": "watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men  discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. \"I've said it repeatedly that we support export controls, and that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. The proposal isn't expected to be part of the NDAA, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Huang said it was \"wise\" that the proposal is being left out of the annual defense policy bill. \"The GAIN AI Act is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act,\" Huang said.  Nvidia's CEO also criticized the idea of establishing a patchwork of state laws regulating AI. The notion of state-by-state regulation has generated pushback from tech companies and spurred the creation of a super PAC called \"Leading the Future,\" which is backed by the AI industry. \"State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible,\" Huang said. \"A federal AI regulation is the wisest.\"Trump last month urged legislators to include a provision in the NDAA that would preempt state AI laws in favor of \"one federal standard.\"But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told CNBC's Emily Wilkins on Tuesday the provision won't make it into the bill, citing a lack of sufficient support. He and other lawmakers will continue to look for ways to establish a national standard on AI, Scalise added. WATCH: Nvidia currying favor to be able to sell chips in Chinawatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday at the UBS Global Technology and AI conference. It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. \"No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,\" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the chipmaker plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. \"Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,\" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\"We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,\" Huang said. Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. \"Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,\" Huang said. \"It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.\"Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said the company's \"largest focus\" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. Huang called his company's strategic investments \"really important work\" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. \"All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,\" Huang said, referring to the company's artificial intelligence software.In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and U.K. raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multibillion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.\"It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,\" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. \"I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.\"WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he supports export controls ahead of Senate Banking Committee meetingwatch now",

    "body": "A person walks by a sign for Micron Technology headquarters in San Jose, California, on June 25, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesMicron said on Wednesday that it plans to stop selling memory to consumers to focus on meeting demand for high-powered artificial intelligence chips. \"The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,\" Sumit Sadana, Micron business chief, said in a statement. \"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.\"Micron's announcement is the latest sign that the AI infrastructure boom is creating shortages for inputs like memory as a handful of companies commit to spend hundreds of billions in the next few years to build massive data centers. Memory, which is used by computers to store data for short periods of time, is facing a global shortage.Micron shares are up about 175% this year, though they slipped 3% on Wednesday to $232.25. AI chips, like the GPUs made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, use large amounts of the most advanced memory. For example, the current-generation Nvidia GB200 chip has 192GB of memory per graphics processor. Google's latest AI chip, the Ironwood TPU, needs 192GB of high-bandwidth memory. Memory is also used in phones and computers, but with lower specs, and much lower quantities — many laptops only come with 16GB of memory. Micron's Crucial brand sold memory on sticks that tinkerers could use to build their own PCs or upgrade their laptops. Crucial also sold solid-state hard drives. Micron competes against SK Hynix and Samsung in the market for high-bandwidth memory, but it's the only U.S.-based memory supplier. Analysts have said that SK Hynix is Nvidia's primary memory supplier. Micron supplies AMD, which says its AI chips use more memory than others, providing them a performance advantage for running AI. AMD's current AI chip, the MI350, comes with 288GB of high-bandwidth memory.  Micron's Crucial business was not broken out in company earnings. However, its cloud memory business unit showed 213% year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter. Analysts at Goldman on Tuesday raised their price target on Micron's stock to $205 from $180, though they maintained their hold recommendation. The analysts wrote in a note to clients that due to \"continued pricing momentum\" in memory, they \"expect healthy upside to Street estimates\" when Micron reports quarterly results in two weeks.A Micron spokesperson declined to comment on whether the move would result in layoffs.\"Micron intends to reduce impact on team members due to this business decision through redeployment opportunities into existing open positions within the company,\" the company said in its release.WATCH: Winners and losers from surge in prices for memory chipswatch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed big cuts to strict fuel economy standards for passenger cars enacted under the Biden administration. \"We are officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, CAFE standards that imposed expensive restrictions,\" Trump said at the Oval Office, flanked by the CEOs of Ford Motor and Stellantis.The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards date back to 1975 and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more efficient.Former President Joe Biden had required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031. These stricter standards were expected to stimulate the production and sale of electric vehicles in the U.S. The standards proposed by the Trump administration would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump has sought to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for electric vehicles as well as renewable energy since taking office.  The oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute has lobbied the Trump administration to repeal the Biden fuel economy standards, contending that they aim to phase out liquid fuel vehicles.The announcement was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, as well as a plant manager for General Motors from Michigan.Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa listen as U.S. President Donald Trump announces new fuel economy standards, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 3, 2025. Brian Snyder | ReutersMany of the officials in attendance, including U.S. dealers, said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly ones automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.Trump and other officials also touted the new regulations as assisting in vehicle affordability, which has been an ongoing concern for the automotive industry, as the average new vehicle purchased hovers around $50,000.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents the majority of automakers operating in the U.S., also praised the cuts.\"We're reviewing NHTSA's announcement, but we're glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,\" John Bozzella, CEO of the organization, said in a statement. \"We've been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs.\"U.S. EV leader Tesla did not respond for comment regarding the reduced standards.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "While homeownership is traditionally viewed as a quintessential rite of passage, for many millennials and Gen Z, the goal of buying a house feels out of reach. A 2025 Bankrate survey found that 22% of aspiring millennial buyers could not find a property they could afford between 2020 and 2025 and had given up on buying a home. It was the highest percentage among all generations, with Gen Xers at 17%, Gen Zers and baby boomers at 12%. Some other major obstacles to homeownership include high mortgage rates and low supply. Amanda Pendleton, home trends expert at Zillow, says prospective homebuyers have had to get creative because they face two major hurdles: saving enough for a down payment and fluctuating mortgage interest rates.More and more some young aspiring homebuyers are exploring an unconventional way to achieve that American dream: \"Co-buying\" with friends.\"Co-buying was not a thing a decade ago. This is in response to the affordability crisis we're dealing with,\" Pendleton tells CNBC Make It. While some experts say co-buying has become a viable option for homeownership, it's not for everyone. The majority of homebuyers are still taking the more traditional route, with 52% co-buying a property with a spouse/partner and 8% co-buying with a relative, according to Zillow. In 2023, 14% of buyers co-bought with a friend. But that number dropped to 5% in 2025, according to the real estate marketplace. Pendleton says one reason the rate of co-buying has fallen in the past few years is that rent prices have stabilized, while mortgage interest rates are almost double what they were during the Covid-19 pandemic. \"The barrier to entry for homeownership is that much higher. You need to stay in your home a lot longer in order to make that purchase cost-effective,\" she says.\"The idea of buying with a friend sounds great for maybe a few years but knowing that you need to stay in that home now for eight to 10 years might make buying a little less desirable.\"Millennials represent the largest generation of people sharing homes with non-relatives, data shows. In the notoriously expensive housing markets of New York City and Washington, D.C, two pairs of friends found a solution in co-buying. And on the other side of the country, in Portland, Oregon, two couples found it to be the most attainable path to homeownership. Here's a look inside their unique arrangements and why they say that sharing a life — and a mortgage — works.Single moms creating a village in Washington, D.C.Rascoe and Melvin bought a five-bedroom, four-bathroom house earlier this year.CNBC Make ItAyesha Rascoe, 40, and Jasmin Melvin, 39, have been friends for over 15 years. In early 2025, the two found themselves divorced and looking for new places to live. Both women work as journalists in the D.C. area — Rascoe is the host of NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday and the weekend host of Up First — and decided to explore buying a home together in Washington, D.C.\"We weren't first-time home buyers,\" Rascoe says.\"For us, the bigger thing was to have the village,\"  Melvin adds.The pair bought a five-bedroom, four-bathroom house for $905,000. They put down 15% down payment of $133,015, and split the cost 60/40. Rascoe and Melvin signed a 30-year mortgage and divide the little over $6,000 monthly payment the same way they split their down payment.The two friends split the monthly mortgage payment 60/40.CNBC Make ItTo protect themselves, the friends entered into a joint tenancy, meaning they each own 100% of the home. \"If something were to happen to one of us, the other person will then solely own the home,\" Melvin says. \"We had to make that decision early on.\"\"It's untraditional, but you take much bigger risks when you're falling in love and getting married to someone who you've known for maybe three or four years,\" Rascoe adds. Buying the house together has helped the women create a village, Rascoe says, and they consider themselves to be platonic co-parents. \"We are raising our kids together. We're partners in that and we are taking care of all five of these kids. We're in it together,\" Rascoe adds. Friends investing in themselves in New York CityWhen friends and co-workers Gilbert Nyantakyi and Kwame Nkrumah, both 28, realized that they couldn't afford to buy a place in New York City individually, they decided their best strategy would be to go in on a deal together. Nyantakyi and Nkrumah live together in one of the apartments in their 3-bedroom house and rent the other two.CNBC Make ItNyantakyi and Nkrumah both work in finance and tech in New York City. Friends for 18 years, the two consider themselves brothers, they say, and have always shared an interest in real estate, they just didn't know the best way to get into the market. When the two started their home search, they knew they wanted to buy a property with multiple units so they could live in one and rent out the others. They said they didn't want to leave New York City, but initially started looking to buy outside the Big Apple because they didn't believe they could afford anything else. They toured properties in the tri-state area like Newark, Union City and Jersey City, New Jersey. \"Funny enough, those markets were actually starting to appreciate in value as well. We just thought it made the most sense to come back to our homes, where we're used to,\" Nyantakyi says. \"Why purchase elsewhere for a very expensive price when we could purchase in our home city for a very similar price.\" In 2023, after a difficult, months-long process, the two bought a three-family home in the Bronx for $730,000. As a first-time buyer, Nyantakyi qualified for a Federal Housing Administration loan, which allowed the friends to make a minimum down payment of 3.5% or $25,550. The two friends use the rental income from the other units to help pay off their mortgage.CNBC Make ItThe friends live in a three-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in the house. Their monthly mortgage is about $5,300, and they use part of the rental income from the other two apartments to pay it and then split whatever is left equally, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. \"From the very start, we knew that this investment would yield the most return after we both move out. If life happens, for example Kwame gets married, I get married and for one reason or the other, we have to move out,\" Nyantakyi says. \"[I] guess that's when the real investment starts.\"\"One thing about me and Gilbert is that we kind of do everything together. We go to church together, we play golf together. It's been more so an easier journey being roommates as well as business partners,\" Nkrumah says.A group of four building community in Portland, OregonJendayi Brooks-Flemister, 29, and their partner had been looking for a place to buy in the Portland area for a while, but they said they kept running into issues: Either the house was too far from the neighborhood they wanted to live in, or it needed too much work, which they weren't willing to take on. \"The housing market wasn't working in our favor. It wasn't feeling doable,\" Brooks-Flemister says. Friends of Brooks-Flemister and their partner — also a couple — moved to the city around that time and were looking to buy as well. Brooks-Flemister says the couples began to wonder: what if, instead of searching separately, they looked at multifamily homes together?After months of looking, the four found a duplex with four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a yard in their ideal neighborhood. \"It was kind of like this magical moment had appeared,\" Brooks-Flemister says. \"And it would have been cheaper than if we had bought two homes separately.\"In 2024, the couples bought the house for $735,000. Each of the four owns 25% of the property. The group have a monthly mortgage payment of $5,700 or $2,850 per household, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Brooks-Flemister says co-buying was the best decision they've made and they don't have any regrets about it. \"I wish I had thought about it sooner,\" Brooks-Flemister says. \"The community alone is the biggest piece of all of it, and it's going to keep growing. I can't wait to see how big our village gets.\"When co-buying, it's best to get everything in writingJust like with a romantic partner, co-buying with friends can get complicated.Andy Sirkin, attorney at SirkinLaw APC, says that since there can be many unknowns, it's better to cover your bases before closing the deal.Pendelton and Sirkin both advise getting everything in writing before co-buying with anyone, even close friends.\"I often tell people that they should think of the agreement as a form of insurance,\" Sorkin says. \"There's a lot of people out there without agreements. What's the problem with that? Well, they're just taking more risk.\"An example of an agreement co-buyers can put in place include a TIC (Tenancy in Common) agreement. It allows multiple parties to have ownership in a property but if one dies, the ownership transfers to their estate and not the other co-owners. A TIC allows each co-owner to choose who will inherit their ownership interest upon death. There is also a joint tenancy agreement, which requires each co-owner's interest to pass to the other co-owners upon death. \"If they ever do have a conflict and don't have an agreement, the cost of that in terms of the impact on their lives is going to be much worse than if they were strangers because now we're talking about a very long-standing and important relationship between the parties that could get undermined or disrupted or maybe ruined altogether,\" Sirkin says. \"That's much bigger than any economic impact that the lack of agreement might have.\"Rascoe and Melvin have a joint tenancy agreement in place, and are working on getting other protections in writing as well, they say.\"Getting lawyers involved is genuinely just to make sure that someone else is aware of the agreement,\" Brooks-Flemister says. Co-buying is a trend that is here to stay and will continue to be a way for people to achieve the American dream of homeownership, Pendleton says. \"When you're buying a home, you're buying a tiny piece of Earth and there's only so much of that to go around. Over time, home values do tend to rise, and homeownership allows you the opportunity to start building equity and to take advantage of that wealth-building potential. A lot of people want a piece of that even if they may not be in the perfect state of life for that to happen,\" Pendleton says. \"As long as the barriers to entry of homeownership remain high, I think we're going to see people come up with these new creative ways to make it work for them.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "American flags flutter outside a Hyundai automobile dealership in Irvine, California, U.S., March 27, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — Hyundai Motor and General Motors are set to be two of the greatest beneficiaries of lower U.S. tariffs on imports, including vehicles, from South Korea.The South Korean-based automaker is the largest U.S. importer of new vehicles from the country, followed by GM. Both automakers have paid billions of dollars in levies so far this year after President Donald Trump placed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles from South Korea and other countries in the spring. The Trump administration this past week confirmed plans to lower tariffs on certain products, including vehicles, to 15% from South Korea. A notice about the implementation of the trade deal was posted Wednesday on the Federal Register. Other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom also have negotiated lower tariff rates with the Trump administration.Prior to the reduction, Hyundai reported U.S. tariffs costed the company 1.8 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in the third quarter, up from 828 billion won ($565 million) in the previous quarter. GM most recently said its tariff impacts, largely from South Korea and Mexico, were expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in 2025.GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Wednesday that the automaker initially expected tariffs on South Korean imports to cost $2 billion but that the company has been able to offset many of those costs. He said GM expects the levies to cost closer to $1 billion or less in 2026.\"We do think that is going to be a tailwind next year, just not as much as the whole 50% because the ultimate tariff bill that we're going to pay this year for Korea was going to be a lot lower than the $2 billion from the stuff that we've been working on,\" Jacobson said during a UBS conference.The U.S. tariff announcement comes after South Korea officially introduced legislation in its parliament aiming to fulfill its promise to invest $350 billion for the U.S. over several years.Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung delivers remarks, as U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry stand, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 24, 2025. Carlos Barria | Reuters\"Korea's commitment to American investment strengthens our economic partnership and domestic jobs and industry. We are also grateful for the deep trust between our two nations,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement posted Monday on X.Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker said the tariffs are still challenging but better than 25% as the automaker aims for a sixth-consecutive year of record U.S. retail sales in 2026. \"Fifteen percent is still 15%,\" he told CNBC during a phone interview Tuesday. \"Getting to 15% is a great milestone. It's been quite the journey reaching this agreement, which has been, I would say, quite extensive.\"Hyundai, including its Kia subsidiary that operates separately in the U.S., has significantly increased its sales and operations in the U.S. in recent years. But the automaker continues to import the majority of its vehicles — estimated to be nearly 1 million units this year — from South Korea.GlobalData estimates more than 1.37 million vehicles, or about 8.6% of the U.S. sales this year, will be vehicles that were imported from South Korea — making the country the largest exporter of American-sold vehicles aside from Mexico.Hyundai is expected to import more than 951,000 vehicles in 2025, according to GlobalData. That includes more than 369,000 for Kia and 582,000 for Hyundai and its luxury Genesis brand.Hyundai aims to have more than 80% of its U.S. vehicle sales be produced locally by 2030, the company said this year. That compares with roughly 40% currently. Despite the tariffs, GM is estimated to import nearly 422,000 vehicles from South Korea this year to the U.S., according to GlobalData. That would be a 3.6% increase compared with record imports of more than 407,000 units last year.GM has increasingly used South Korean plants to produce popular entry-level crossovers for Chevrolet and Buick. Its U.S. sales of South Korean-produced vehicles — largely entry-level models — have risen from 173,000 in 2019 to more than 407,000 last year, according to GlobalData.GM, in an emailed statement, said the company \"appreciates that negotiators have finalized an agreement on trade between the US and South Korea.\"\"GM's long-standing Korea operations produce high-quality, affordable crossovers that complement our U.S. vehicles and domestic production, which will soon rise to 2 million units. We will be monitoring and reviewing the details,\" GM said.GM produces its Buick Encore GX and Buick Envista crossovers, as well as the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Chevrolet Trax crossovers, at plants in South Korea. The company has touted the vehicles as being a pinnacle for the automaker's profitable growth in lower-margin, entry-level vehicles.Detainees are made to stand against a bus before being handcuffed, during a raid by federal agents where about 300 South Koreans were among 475 people arrested at the site of a $4.3 billion project by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution to build batteries for electric cars in Ellabell, Georgia, U.S. September 4, 2025 in a still image taken from a video.

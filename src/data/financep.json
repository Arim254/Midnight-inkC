Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesStarbucks is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday before the bell.Here's what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG are expecting the company to report:Earnings per share: 59 cents expectedRevenue: $9.67 billion expectedAnalysts are also anticipating that Starbucks had a successful holiday season. In November, about halfway through the quarter, CEO Brian Niccol said the company had its biggest-ever sales day in North America on the launch day for its holiday menu. Starbucks' same-store sales are projected to have risen 2.3% in the quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. An increase would mark the second straight quarter that the coffee chain has reported same-store sales growth, indicating that Niccol's turnaround plan is taking hold in the U.S. Investors are expecting to hear more details about Niccol's strategy on Thursday at an investor day held in New York City. Executives will also share the company's new long-term financial targets. Starbucks suspended its outlook in October 2024, shortly after Niccol took the reins.Shares of Starbucks have fallen more than 3% over the last year, weighed down by investor concerns about its turnaround and a broader pullback in consumer spending. The stock has a market value of roughly $109 billion.",

Appearing together at a forum in the French capital as they seek to shore up support from European allies, the political leaders sought to portray a united front amid U.S. President Donald Trump's Greenland threats. \"The world order as we know it that we have been fighting for 80 years is over and I don't think it will return,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at Science Po University in Paris, according to Reuters.\"The best way forward for the U.S, Europe is to stick together … We will try to find a way forward with U.S. We share concerns on Arctic security. Russia does not want peace with Europe,\" she added. Greenland's Nielsen, meanwhile, said the self-governing Danish territory agrees that there is a need for more surveillance and security in the Arctic \"because of the way Russia acts now.\" He added that Greenland would not give in to foreign pressure.\"What we are dealing with as a government is trying to push back from outside and handle our people who are afraid and scared,\" Nielsen said.The comments come shortly after Nielsen and Frederiksen held talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Berlin on Tuesday. Trump, who has long advocated for control of Greenland, said in a surprise development last week that he had secured a framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland. The U.S. president did not give further details at the time, although he said talks would continue to reach an agreement.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.",

    "body": "Activity on Elizabeth Street (at the intersection of Bourke St Mall), Melbourne on a cloudy day.Charlie Rogers | Moment | Getty ImagesAustralia's inflation came in at 3.6% in the fourth quarter of 2025, its highest level in six quarters, reinforcing warnings from policymakers that interest rate cuts this year are likely to be limited.The fourth-quarter reading was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters and up from the 3.2% seen in the third quarter. On a quarterly basis, inflation rose 0.6%, also matching the Reuters forecast and easing sharply from the 1.3% seen in the previous quarter.For December, inflation in Australia rose 3.8% year on year, exceeding the 3.55% expected by economists.The Australian Bureau of Statistics said housing was the largest contributor to the rise in December, with prices rising 5.5%.Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as recreation and culture, also contributed to the month's price gains.The higher inflation reading will prompt the central bank to maintain a \"cautious stance,\" according to Shier Lee Lim, Lead FX & Macro Strategist for Asia Pacific at foreign exchange firm Convera. While Lim said a rate hike at the bank's February policy meeting is unlikely, further tightening cannot be ruled out if inflation remains sticky and above target in the coming quarters.The Reserve Bank of Australia aims to keep inflation within a 2% to 3% target range.'Too high' for rate cutsThe inflation reading follows recent comments from Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser, who said that inflation at current levels is \"too high.\" \"Inflation above 3%, let's be clear, is too high. We're charged to keep inflation between two to three per cent and it's currently above that,\" Hauser said in an interview with ABC on Jan. 8. Hauser said the likelihood of further rate cuts in the near term was \"probably very low.\"His remarks echoed comments from RBA Governor Michele Bullock after the RBA's rate decision on Dec. 9, when she said that interest rate cuts were not on the horizon for the foreseeable future.Australia's economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter, expanding from a revised 2% in the second quarter and marking its fastest growth in about two years. Bullock said in December that rate cuts were not needed at that time, citing a recovery in private-sector activity and growth surpassing public demand.",

    "body": "A five-month process of finding the next Federal Reserve chair appears to be down to its final days, with one candidate emerging as the betting favorite even as others remain in the mix.BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder is seen by prediction markets as the frontrunner to replace Jerome Powell at the helm of the central bank. Kalshi has the Wall Street veteran holding a 48% chance, well ahead of the next-closest competitor, former Governor Kevin Warsh, at 31%.But sentiment has been volatile, and it was Warsh who held a decided advantage less than a week ago.What has swung the pendulum seems tenuous: In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum, Trump called Rieder \"very impressive,\" and a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said White House officials generally liked Rieder.While that was enough to sway wagers on sites like Kalshi and Polymarket, some on Wall Street are less convinced and still see it as a competitive race yet to be decided by a notoriously fickle president. With Warsh still well in the mix, some analysts also think the market's move away from National Economic Council (NEC) director Kevin Hassett is at least too hasty.The Kevins are still aliveWhile acknowledging market sentiment about Rieder, Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy and politics at Wolfe Research, said in a note that \"we remain unconvinced\" on the money manager, adding, \"We think both Kevins are still strong possibilities.\"\"Just last week, Trump was continuing to strongly emphasize 'loyalty' as a criterion, which is an obstacle for Rieder,\" Marcus added. \"If this is still the President's mindset, that seems like an obvious problem for Rieder, who is in no way a loyalist ... We also continue to think betting markets are misinterpreting Trump's comments on Hassett.\"That's a reference to Trump, in a recent White House conversation with reporters, emphasizing that he would miss Hassett at the NEC and would prefer to see him stay in that role. However, neither Trump nor any White House officials who have spoken about the matter have dismissed Hassett as a contender. Marcus wrote off the Trump comment about Hassett as \"a cheeky quip\" that may not represent his feelings about filling the Fed chair.Former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson voiced similar views in a CNBC interview Monday, saying he still thinks the decision comes down to \"one of the Kevins.\"\"Only one person knows, and the rest of us are speculating,\" Ferguson added. He called Rieder a \"qualified person [and] Wall Street favorite ... but I really think it's unlikely that he'll be the first one across the finish line.\"There's also the possibility that Trump could play a wild card in the form of hiring someone not thought to be among the finalists. He has stated previously that he would like to name Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to the job but that the former hedge fund manager doesn't want it.Neither Rieder nor White House officials returned a request for comment.Looking at RiederShould he look Rieder's way, Trump would get someone who fits his views in many ways, including a desire for lower interest rates and a willingness to use the Fed's balance sheet to guide the economy.After the Fed approved a quarter percentage point cut in December, the third such move in a row, Rieder wrote, \"rates are still too high for the housing market to [recover] its buoyancy, and small businesses (important providers of new jobs) and young households are still struggling.\" He noted that the fed funds rate \"is excessively blunt to deal with issues better resolved through fiscal channels.\"Rieder would be an interesting choice for a number of reasons, not least because he represents a firm that is the face of globalist finance and would serve under a president known for his anti-globalist views. Though Trump has many times expressed his distaste for Powell and threatened to fire him more than once, Rieder would carry a huge similarity to the current chair in that neither has a PhD in economics, instead holding market-rich backgrounds. In Rieder's case, that meant a long stint at Lehman Brothers before the Wall Street investment banking titan imploded in 2008, an event associated with the beginning of the global financial crisis.At BlackRock, Rieder engineers a $2.5 trillion bond portfolio that includes the $14.5 billion iShares Flexible Income Active exchange-traded fund. The entire firm manages $14 trillion in client money and runs the government's Thrift Savings Plan, a federal employees' retirement fund. Moreover, the Fed called on BlackRock during the Covid crisis in 2020 to manage its controversial purchases of corporate bonds aimed at steadying capital flows at a time of extreme economic peril. Like other major financial firms and primary dealers, BlackRock officials, including its influential CEO Larry Fink, are in continuous contact with the Fed.Fed independencePotential downsides, at least from Trump's view, might be that Rieder has stated he'd like to see the Fed's key interest rate around 3%, only about half a percentage point below its current level and above desired by the president and other White House officials. He has also expressed support for Fed independence and seems unlikely to take marching orders from Trump.In a separate appearance at the World Economic Forum — held each year in Davos, Switzerland, where BlackRock plays a huge role — Trump mused about the difficulty in finding a Fed chair who would do his bidding. Few if any presidents in U.S. history have been so open about trying to influence monetary policy.\"They get the job, they're locked in for six years. They get the job and all of a sudden, 'let's raise rates a little bit,'\" Trump said, misstating the length of the four-year terms for chairs. \"It's amazing how people change once they have the job. It's too bad. It's sort of disloyalty. But they've got to do what they think is right.\"While Trump may again become dissatisfied with the next Fed chair, markets likely will welcome whomever Trump chooses, including Rieder, at least among those considered in the running.\"The BlackRock fixed income CIO, who has not worked in a policy position before, would bring a perspective grounded in deep granular bottoms-up analysis of corporate data rather than economic theory and models,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \"The market would likely welcome Rieder as one of its own.\"",

(Photo by Chance Yeh/Getty Images for HubSpot)Chance Yeh | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has issued a fresh warning about how AI will disrupt the job market, saying it will cause \"unusually painful\" disruption.The AI chief, who co-founded Anthropic in 2021 with his sister Daniela Amodei and is behind the creation of the AI chatbot Claude, warned AI would destroy half of all white-collar jobs last year. The issue has divided opinion among business and tech leaders. Amodei's warning prompted Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to say he \"thinks AI is so scary, but only [Anthropic] should do it.\"On Monday, Amodei published a roughly 20,000-word essay arguing the risks AI poses are not being taken seriously and warning the technology will lead to a \"shock\" to the job market, bigger than any before.Amodei set out what he regards as the potential harms of AI, including the tech becoming autonomous and unpredictable, bad actors or terrorist groups using it to create bio-weapons, and some countries creating a \"global totalitarian dictatorship\" by exploiting AI to gain disproportionate power.\"Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it,\" Amodei wrote. In the essay, he elaborated on his argument that humans will find it difficult to recover from AI's impact on the labor market in the short-term. \"New technologies often bring labor market shocks, and in the past, humans have always recovered from them, but I am concerned that this is because these previous shocks affected only a small fraction of the full possible range of human abilities, leaving room for humans to expand to new tasks,\" Amodei said. \"AI will have effects that are much broader and occur much faster, and therefore I worry it will be much more challenging to make things work out well,\" he added.Short-term shockAmodei predicted that humans would be unable to adapt to AI development's rapid pace, and this would trigger an \"unusually painful\" short-term shock in the labor market.\"The pace of progress in AI is much faster than for previous technological revolutions,\" he wrote. \"It is hard for people to adapt to this pace of change, both to the changes in how a given job works and in the need to switch to new jobs.\" He said this was largely because AI's \"cognitive breadth\" meant it wouldn't affect one industry but could simultaneously wipe out jobs across finance, consulting, law, and tech, denying workers the option to \"switch lanes\" to another industry where their skillset was a match. \"The technology is not replacing a single job but acting as a 'general labor substitute for humans,'\" Amodei wrote.Tackling this problem, according to Amodei, will \"require government intervention,\" such as \"progressive taxation,\" which targets AI firms in particular.President and CEO of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang attends the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2026. Denis Balibouse | ReutersAI eliminating jobs has dominated headlines in the past year. The technology was given as a reason for nearly 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, per December data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in November found AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, saving up to $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services.Consultancy firm Mercer's Global Talent Trends 2026 report, which surveyed 12,000 people worldwide, found 40% of employees feared losing their jobs to AI, up from 28% in 2024.But Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note last week that \"AI redundancy washing will be a significant feature of 2026,\" as major companies blame the technology for job cuts that actually have other causes. Yale University's Budget Lab said in an October report that AI hadn't yet caused widespread job losses, according to its analysis of U.S. labor market data from 2022 to 2025. It found that the share of workers in different jobs hadn't changed significantly since ChatGPT's debut in November sparked a surge of interest in AI.Others see job creation in blue-collar industries, for example, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang said AI is actually going to \"create a lot of jobs\" for plumbers, electricians, construction workers, and those building AI-related factories. \"And so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,\" he added.JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon shared a similar view at the World Economic Forum last week, saying that governments need to come in at a \"local level\" and provide incentives to firms to retrain people and provide income assistance as AI takes over some jobs.",

But the Senate has only until 12:01 a.m. Saturday to pass the bills and keep the government fully funded.The killing of Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has prompted outrage among Senate Democrats, who have called for the DHS bill to be stripped from the larger spending package in exchange for their votes.Democratic support for the spending bills is needed to clear the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.\"Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday. \"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If [Majority  Leader John] Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\" Trump and the White House this week softened the administration's stance on Pretti, seemingly walking back earlier statements made by administration officials like Stephen Miller, Trump's homeland security adviser, who labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing on Monday.Still, tensions remain high after the deaths of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, another citizen killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.DHS recently launched an immigration enforcement investigation in Minnesota, sending federal agents to the state in response to an ongoing social services fraud scandal and targeting thousands of refugees.Minnesota state officials and congressional Democrats have sharply condemned the tactics used by DHS and ICE, and some congressional Republicans have also called for increased oversight.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Monday called on the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, which he chairs.He also called for an \"independent investigation\" into the shooting.\"Local police routinely, put officers involved in deadly shootings on administrative leave until an independent investigation is concluded. That should happen immediately. I can't recall ever hearing a police chief immediately describing the victim as a 'domestic terrorist' or a 'would-be assassin,'\" Paul said in a post to X on Tuesday.   \"For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,\" he wrote.ICE, CPB, and USCIS officials agreed Tuesday to testify at a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Feb. 10.",

Speaking to reporters during a visit to Iowa to promote his economic record, Trump was asked if he was comfortable with the current value of the greenback and if he thought it had fallen too much after sliding 10% over the past year. \"I think it's great,\" Trump said of the weaker dollar. \"I mean the value of the dollar, look at the business we're doing. No, [the] dollar is doing great. You know it's very interesting, if you look at China or Japan, I used to fight like hell with them because they always wanted to devalue their yen ... you know that, the yen and yuan, and they'd always want to devalue it. They devalue, devalue, devalue. And I said, 'not fair.' They devalue, because it's hard to compete when they devalue.\"The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six leading trading partners (but not China), fell the most in a single day since last April 10, when it tumbled almost 2% amid mounting trade disputes and U.S. threats to impose a 145% tariff on China.

    "body": "Homes in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter dropping sharply, mortgage interest rates rose last week for the first time in a month. That pushed total mortgage demand down 8.5% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, increased to 6.24% from 6.16%, with points increasing to 0.55 from 0.54, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest rate in three weeks.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan dropped 16% for the week, but they were still 156% higher than the same week one year ago. That is because rates a year ago were 78 basis points higher.  \"FHA refinance activity bucked the overall trend and increased, as FHA rates remained almost 20 basis points lower than conforming rates,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist in a release. \"With rates holding in the 6 percent range, the refinance market is likely to remain sensitive to week-to-week rate movements.\" Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home were essentially flat, down 0.4% from one week earlier and 18% higher year-over-year. Homebuyers are still facing a very pricey market. There is more supply than last year, but most of it is on the high end.\"The average loan size stayed at its highest level since September 2025,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly lower to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The next chance for a sizeable move in rates in either direction comes today with the latest meeting of the FOMC. Most expect it to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but markets will be ready to react to commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October. In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. The cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"On Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"Read more CNBC tech newsApple, Google host dozens of AI 'nudify' apps like Grok, report findsBlockbuster social media trial kicks off, with more to come this yearMeta inks deal to pay Corning up to $6 billion for fiber-optic cables in AI data centersTikTok blames data center outages for U.S. app problems, denies censorship claimsAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.The 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people. Amazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024. CEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services. Jassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster. Amazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest more in AI and the rapid buildout of data centers. Earlier this week, the company shuttered its Fresh and Go grocery chains after years of experimentation. Last October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.Jassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

Photographer: Bridget Bennett/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip stocks jumped on Wednesday thanks to strong earnings from heavyweights ASML and SK Hynix and a report that China has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips.The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was up more than 3% in premarket trade.In Europe, ASML was 5% higher in morning trade with other semiconductor firms, including Infineon and STMicro, also in the green.Dutch chipmaker ASML on Wednesday reported bumper fourth-quarter earnings with orders above analyst expectations, while its 2026 sales forecast was also ahead of estimates.South Korea's SK Hynix shares closed more than 5% higher after it reported record full-year profit for 2025. Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Wednesday that China has approved domestic tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent to buy Nvidia's H200 system, a critical development in the long-running saga of Nvidia's position in China, a huge market for the company.While the U.S. had said earlier this year it would authorise H200 sales, China was reportedly pushing its companies to buy domestic alternatives. In May, Nvidia said export restrictions to China would cost it $8 billion in lost sales.Nvidia shares were up around 1.6% in premarket trade.watch nowWhat drove earnings?Broader market dynamics helped ASML and SK Hynix's earnings. There is a major shortage of memory chips, which are key components for consumer electronics and data centers. This has led to an unprecedented rise in prices for the components which helped SK Hynix, one of the world's largest memory players.Meanwhile, chip manufacturers are expected to expand production to meet demand for memory and other types of AI-related chips, such as Nvidia's. ASML is the producer of so-called extreme ultraviolet lithography machines which are critical tools to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world. As chipmakers look to expand production, they will require ASML's machines. This demand helped the company report 13.2 billion euros ($15.8 billion) worth of bookings, a key metric for investors.ASML and SK Hynix's financials add to the positive signs in the semiconductor industry in the past few days.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chipmaker, reported record fourth quarter profit earlier this month.",

    "body": "Illustration of the SK Hynix logo displayed on a phone screen. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korean memory giant SK Hynix announced Wednesday that it will set up a new U.S.-based company focused on artificial intelligence solutions, committing at least $10 billion as it seizes on new AI growth engines.The new U.S. entity, tentatively named \"AI Company or AI Co.,\" will serve as a hub for SK Group's AI strategies and work to accelerate the technology in global markets, the company said.SK Hynix has emerged as a major AI player in recent years due to its leadership in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, a type of memory used in AI chipsets like those from Nvidia.The company's U.S. expansion comes as other tech giants intensify investments in AI, driving intense demand for memory chips.SK Hynix said that it will create the new \"AI Company\" by restructuring its California-based subsidiary Solidigm, an enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) manufacturer created in 2021. Solidigm's operations will then be transferred to a new entity named Solidigm Inc.The planned investments in AI Co. are expected to be deployed on a capital-call basis, with plans for further strategic investments in American AI firms to boost synergies across SK Group affiliates.watch nowThe announcement follows SK Hynix's forecast-beating fourth-quarter also announced Wednesday, with profits boosted by ongoing shortages across the memory supply chain that have pushed up prices.To capitalize on this surging AI demand, SK Hynix has been accelerating investments and has also committed nearly $13 billion to build an advanced chip packaging plant in South Korea.The plans for a new entity based in the U.S. also align with the priorities of the Trump administration, which has threatened tariffs on semiconductor manufacturers unless they heavily invest in the U.S.SK Hynix is already in the process of building a $3.87 billion advanced chip packaging fabrication and R&D facility in Indiana, announced back in 2024. The facility will produce high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI applications, with operations slated to begin in 2028.U.S. President Donald Trump has also been engaged in broader tariff negotiations with South Korea in recent months. However, the president said on Tuesday that Washington would \"work something out\" with South Korea following his recent tariff threats, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions.",

    "body": "onathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesASML reported on Wednesday orders that smashed past expectations while 2026 sales guidance was also ahead of estimates as AI demand continues to support the Dutch chip giant's business. Bookings, one of the most closely-watched metrics from investors, came in at 13.2 billion euros ($15.8 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2025, ahead of analyst expectations of 6.32 billion euros, according to Visible Alpha, as cited by Reuters. This was a record quarter for orders, according to ASML's finance chief Roger Dassen.ASML also announced a 12-billion-euro share buyback plan to be executed by Dec. 31, 2028. The company said it expects net sales in the current quarter of between 8.2 billion and 8.9 billion euros and total sales for 2026 to come in at between 34 billion euros and 39 billion euros. The mid-point is above analyst expectations of 35.1 billion. ASML previously said it does not expect 2026 total net sales to be below 2025. The company's new forecast points to revenue growth of between 4% and 19% compared to 2025, signaling an improvement on its prior commentary on 2026, when a rise in revenue was uncertain.Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fourth quarter:Net sales: 9.7 billion euros ($11.6 billion) versus 9.6 billion euros expectedNet profit: 2.84 billion euros vs 3.01 billion euros expectedASML also announced on Wednesday that it was going to make layoffs which would result in a net reduction of around 1,700 positions, mostly in the Netherlands, with some in the United States. In some cases the company's way of working has become \"less agile\" and the job cuts are intended to address this issue, the company said.watch nowAI tailwindsASML, which makes tools required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, is experiencing several tailwinds, driven by the AI infrastructure boom, that have pushed its shares up nearly 30% this year alone.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) this month posted another record rise in profit in the fourth quarter, adding to the narrative that demand for AI chips and infrastructure will continue. TSMC, a customer of ASML, is the world's biggest chipmaker and manufactures semiconductors for companies from Nvidia to AMD. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of memory semiconductors, causing an unprecedented jump in prices of the component, with some in the electronics industry expecting the crunch to continue through 2027. Analysts forecast that the world's biggest memory makers including Samsung and SK Hynix will increase chipmaking capacity in the coming year or two, which would mean these firms will purchase more ASML machines.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconASML shares year-to-dateFor example, Barclays said in a note this month that it expects SK Hynix to take 12 of ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines in 2026.ASML's CFO said that its customers have been \"more positive in their assessment of the medium-term market perspectives.\"\"I think it's primarily on the basis of the more robust view that they have when it comes to demand for AI, which seems to be more sustainable from their vantage point,\" Dassen said in a transcript of a video interview. \"That recognition has led some of our customers to really invest in capacity and gear up their plans for medium-term capacity expansion.\"Revenue from EUV machines, which are among the most advanced machines ASML produces, will \"significantly go up\" in 2026 compared to last year as chipmakers expand production of more advanced semiconductors, ASML said.China in focusInvestors are looking out for any commentary on China, a market where ASML is not allowed to ship its most advanced machines due to export restrictions. The Dutch semiconductor giant said last year that it expects sales in China to decline significantly in 2026 compared to 2024 and 2025.ASML said it expects China revenue to account for 20% of its total sales in 2026. Last year, China accounted for 33% of ASML's net system sales. ",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersA renewed push to conclude a U.S.-India trade deal may get underway, analysts say, as the White House sees other countries and power blocs working harder than ever to remove barriers to trade and tariffs.The urgency and impetus to get talks over the line could come after the EU and India signed off on a long-awaited trade deal on Tuesday, with the agreement seeing both sides phase out tariffs on the vast majority of each other's imports. \"The EU–India deal could ... light a fire under efforts to conclude a U.S.–India trade deal and help to move negotiations forward on a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement,\" Mark Linscott, nonresident senior fellow on India at the Atlantic Council, commented Tuesday.Trump has yet to react to the EU-India deal, which was two decades in the making, but Washington could view bilateral trade agreements between other powerful nations with concern and as a potential threat.The U.S. already has a trade deal with the EU (which has maintained 15% tariffs on EU exports to the States) but when it comes to the U.S.' own stalled trade talks with India — a country it imposed a 50% tariff on — it certainly leaves negotiations in more uncertain territory.But according to Atlantic Council expert Linscott there is no need for a U.S.-India deal to be derailed. \"While the agreement may be interpreted as a response to the Trump administration's tariffs and tariff threats, there is no reason it should undermine the U.S. trade relationships with either the EU or India,\" he said. India's oil and gas minister told CNBC on Tuesday that a U.S.-India trade deal was at a \"very advanced stage\" but conceded he didn't have a timeline for the conclusion of a deal.watch now\"I would try and look at the positive side, I'm not a soothsayer, I don't know when trade deals will get signed, how long it takes ... but I think one [everybody] needs to chill a bit,\" he told CNBC's Amitoj Singh, as India and the EU announced a landmark trade deal.\"I'm told by the people who are in it [the negotiations] that it's at a very advanced stage, and I'm hoping that, sooner rather than later, it will also see the light of day,\" he added of the U.S. deal.Sticking pointsThe EU and India described their agreement as the \"mother of all deals\" and while the accord sees the two countries ally themselves at a time when global trade is under strain from tariffs, sanctions, and geopolitical rivalry, it does not reduce India's desire for a deal with the U.S., analysts at global risk consultancy Teneo noted.The deal \"reduces (though not eliminates) the pressure on India to conclude a deal with the US which remains its largest trade (in both goods and services) and defense partner,\" analysts Arpit Chaturvedi and Carsten Nickel said in emailed comments Tuesday.Read moreCiti analysts said Wednesday that markets will be \"keenly watching immediate repercussions\" of the EU-India deal on India-U.S. tariff talks. \"There would be hope that those negotiations might be fast-tracked now though it remains to be seen whether Indian authorities would be in a better position to withstand the higher U.S. tariffs given the easier access to the large EU market.\"watch nowShumita Deveshwar, chief India economist at TS Lombard, noted that there were a number of sticking points preventing an immediate agreement.\"A free trade deal with the EU after nearly 2 decades of negotiations couldn't come at a better time for India, which is struggling to strike an agreement with the U.S.,\" she said in emailed analysis Wednesday.\"Trade talks with the U.S. are stuck owing to its insistence on getting greater access to India's farm market and for India to stop buying cheap Russian oil ...Agriculture is a highly politically sensitive sector in India given the low level of farm mechanisation and vast numbers of subsistence farmers. However, India does seem to be scaling back its Russian oil purchases,\" she said, noting such purchases had fallen to their lowest level in two years in December.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThis week's Federal Reserve meeting offers little suspense and probably not much action, even as massive changes loom over the central bank's longer-term direction.Judging by market expectations and policymakers' comments, there's virtually no chance the Fed will change its benchmark interest rate when the meeting ends Wednesday.Despite a recent spate of disagreements among Federal Open Market Committee members about the longer-term trajectory of monetary policy, the near-term stance likely will be one of patience as a series of cuts made last year work their way through the economy.\"Overall, the Fed just wants to stand pat. They feel they've got time to wait and see,\" former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson said in a CNBC interview Monday. \"This feels like a wait-and-see meeting, and we should all be listening to see if there's any hint or a bias towards a future action.\"watch nowIndications of where the FOMC heads from here would come from the post-meeting policy statement as well as Chair Jerome Powell's news conference afterward. Markets currently expect the Fed to cut once or twice this year — most likely in June and December, according to futures market pricing gauged by the CME Group's FedWatch tool.However, the focus most certainly will lie beyond the interest rate decision and future guidance and into an unprecedented web of intrigue that surrounds the meeting.Storm around PowellFor one, President Donald Trump told CNBC last week that he may have narrowed down his search for Powell's successor to a single candidate, a nomination that could be announced this week and perhaps even timed to coincide with the Fed rate decision.\"If there is a single most likely window, it's during the January FOMC — particularly if Trump is lookingto redirect attention away from a Fed that didn't cut,\" Stephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said in a note. \"More broadly, the decision could come as soon as this week, or within the next couple of weeks.\"Also operating in the background: The Justice Department has served Powell with a subpoena seeking information on the Fed's massive renovation project on its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In an unusually candid videotaped statement, Powell called the probe a \"pretext\" for Trump's desire to bully the Fed into cutting rates even more aggressively than it has in recent months.There's uncertainty elsewhere, too, with Trump's effort to unseat Fed Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court last week, and Trump appointee Stephen Miran's term expiring Saturday. Fed governors can serve until they are replaced, so it's not clear how much longer Miran will stay on the board. He dissented from each of last year's three, quarter percentage point rate cuts, favoring even larger moves.So while the market will pay close attention to interest rate developments and indications, much of the scrutiny will go toward the ancillary events that have rocked the central bank.Political pressures\"While the Fed has been politically pressured to cut rates, it is not pressed by the data,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. However, Powell \"is likely to refrain from commenting directly on the Department of Justice probe involving himself and the Fed, as well as the Supreme Court's pending ruling related to Governor Cook.\"That won't stop media members from asking, though.\"Powell will be asked about his video warning that Trump DoJ subpoenas and other actions seekto subject monetary policy to the 'preferences of the president,'\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"We think he will stand by everything he said and express faith in the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of Fed independence.\"Absent further political developments, that will bring the focus back to policy.Markets will look to decipher whether the hold this month is hawkish, the precursor of an extended period of no cuts, or dovish, in which Powell and the committee indicate that more cuts are likely, just not now.Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Michael Gapen, expects to see a tilt toward dovish.\"We think recent stabilization in the labor market and solid activity data will be the main drivers behind the decision to pause rate cuts, while incoming data on inflation will keep the Fed confident enough about disinflation later this year to retain an easing bias,\" Gapen said in a note. \"We do not believe committee members are ready to signal an end to the cutting cycle.\"Gapen is also looking for several changes in the post-meeting statement, likely reflecting an upgrade to economic growth and a removal of language on increased downside risks to employment.

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersBEIJING — Chinese companies are accelerating the rollout of new artificial intelligence models as competition with U.S.-based rivals OpenAI, Anthropic and Google intensifies.Just over a year ago, China-made DeepSeek rocked global markets with the release of an AI chatbot that undercut OpenAI's ChatGPT on usage fees and production costs, raising questions about the efficacy of U.S. tech restrictions on China.On Tuesday, Beijing-based startup Moonshot AI revealed Kimi K2.5, which claimed to have video-generation and agentic capabilities that outperformed all three of the leading U.S. AI models. Agentic AI broadly refers to AI systems capable of carrying out tasks on behalf of people. The ultimate goal is to have sophisticated agents that work autonomously with minimal user interaction.The update came just about three months after Moonshot released its K2 model.Hours earlier, e-commerce giant Alibaba announced its latest generative AI model, which can create text, pictures or video based on user commands. Alibaba claimed its Qwen3-Max-Thinking outperformed major U.S. rivals on a broad benchmark test called \"Humanity's Last Exam.\" Alibaba said the new model can automatically select the best AI tool for a range of tasks and draw on past conversations as context to generate new responses more efficiently, all at little additional cost.A week earlier on Jan. 19, Z.ai released a free version of its recently launched GLM 4.7 model. Two days later, the company restricted new subscribers from signing up for its AI coding tool after demand strained its available computing power.  watch nowAlso last week, Hong Kong-traded shares of Chinese tech giant Baidu climbed to their highest level in nearly three years following the release of its latest generative AI model, Ernie 5.0. The company claimed the update outperformed Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro, but did not compare it with Google DeepMind's newest Gemini 3 Pro.Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC this month that China's AI models may be just \"months\" behind those developed in the U.S. Trying other ways to competeBeyond the rollouts, Chinese companies are pushing the adoption of homegrown technologies by making them more affordable for emerging economies.Unlike many leading U.S.-developed AI models, those from China tend to be open-sourced, typically allowing free or low-cost access and the ability to customize the model's underlying code.\"The hope is countries apart from China will use these models to ensure large amounts of applications are built on these Chinese models,\" said Alex Lu, founder of LSY Consulting. \"That's one way for Chinese companies to penetrate the market.\"There are indications that the trend is already happening. Microsoft earlier this month noted estimates that DeepSeek usage in Africa is two to four times higher than in other regions. Paying too much attention to AI benchmarks distracts from the tech's real value — when it is integrated into existing gaming or entertainment ecosystems such as Tencent's, Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note. The Chinese tech giant operates the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app as well as other popular gaming and video streaming apps in China.Tencent on Sunday announced that it will distribute 1 billion yuan ($140 million) in cash awards through its Yuanbao AI chatbot app during the Lunar New Year festival in February. The promotion mimics earlier \"red envelope\" campaigns that helped WeChat become one of the two dominant mobile payment apps just over a decade ago. It is customary for families to give relatives cash in small red envelopes during the holiday.ByteDance and Baidu are also running AI-related promotions around the upcoming holiday in a bid to retain users on their AI applications.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tEarlier this month, Alibaba updated its Qwen AI app to encourage users interacting with the chatbot to shop, order food and pay without leaving the app — thanks to integration with the company's existing e-commerce platforms such as Taobao. Qwen claims more than 100 million monthly active users.This integration could generate more revenue for Alibaba, on the assumption that the greater the number of people who use Qwen, the more they will use Taobao and shop on it, Lu said. That would help offset the costs of developing and running the underlying AI model, he said.Chinese companies are mostly competing for user traffic rather than developing the most advanced models, he said.",

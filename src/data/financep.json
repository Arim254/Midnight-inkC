    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's Samsung Electronics expects its profits to triple in the final three months of last year, reaching a record high, as memory prices surge amid booming demand tied to artificial intelligence. The world's largest memory chipmaker estimated that operating profit reached 20 trillion won and consolidated sales of about 93 trillion won in the fourth quarter, according to an earnings guidance released Thursday. The profit projections mark a significant improvement from a year earlier and would surpass Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018. The surge comes as chipmakers like Nvidia clamor for limited supplies of memory chips used for AI applications. As memory companies prioritize capacity to meet that lucrative demand, it has contributed to a shortage across the broader market, affecting chips used in personal computers and mobile devices.\"The memory market has entered a 'Hyper-Bull' phase, with current conditions eclipsing the historic 2018 peak. Supplier leverage is at an all-time high, driven by an insatiable demand for AI and server capacity,\" Counterpoint Research said in a report Wednesday. The market watcher estimates memory prices surged 40%-50% in the final quarter of 2025, and expects similar gains in the first quarter of 2026, followed by a roughly 20% rise in the second quarter.While these market dynamics have pushed manufacturing costs for most consumer electronics makers, they have been a boon for memory giants like Samsung and its main competitors in the space, SK Hynix and Micron. Samsung shares have gained over 145% over the past 12 months and were up 0.5% on Thursday in choppy trading. The consumer tech giant continues to trail  SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI processors like those from Nvidia. Expanding its HBM production capacity is expected to be a major focus for the company in the new year. Samsung is set to release its audited earnings and hold its quarterly earnings call later this month.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang seems unfazed by the prospect of a potential $7.75 billion tax bill.That's how much the Nvidia CEO could end up owing the state of California if a proposed ballot measure succeeds in implementing a one-time 5% wealth tax on the state's billionaires. Huang, whose $155 billion net worth makes him the world's ninth-wealthiest person — according to a Jan. 6 Bloomberg estimate — would be \"perfectly fine\" with that outcome, he told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday.\"I've got to tell you, I have not even thought about it once,\" said Huang, 62, when asked if the proposed tax concerns him. \"We chose to live in Silicon Valley, and whatever taxes they would like to apply, so be it. I'm perfectly fine with it.\"The ballot initiative, proposed in November by a healthcare workers' union and championed by lawmakers including Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would levy a 5% tax on the total assets of anyone with a net worth exceeding $1.1 billion who resided in California as of the start of 2026. The initiative would direct the tax funds to California's health care budget — which faces a significant shortfall following federal spending cuts — and public school and food assistance programs.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsThe initiative needs to obtain more than 870,000 signatures to land on the state's November 2026 ballot, at which point California voters would decide whether or not to put it into effect. If it were to succeed, billionaires currently residing in California would be taxed on all assets of value, including any stocks or businesses they own, regardless of whether they move out of the state in 2026.Real estate assets would be excluded from the tax, because residents already pay property taxes, according to an analysis by California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Billionaires would be allowed to spread their payments over five years under the proposal.Proponents say the tax could ultimately raise roughly $100 billion from the state's 200 wealthiest individuals, including Huang. While the Nvidia CEO has never released a full breakdown of his assets, Forbes estimates that the vast majority of his wealth comes from his ownership of roughly 3% of Nvidia, a company currently valued at more than $4.6 trillion.An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond Huang's Tuesday remarks when contacted by CNBC Make It.'We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is'Huang's stated apathy over the proposed tax puts him at odds with many of his fellow billionaires in the state, and elsewhere. Billionaire Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey, for example, has said that the proposed tax would force billionaire founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies\" to gain enough liquidity to pay their tax bill, he wrote in a Dec. 28 post on social media platform X.\"Now me and my co-founders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.Another billionaire, venture capitalist and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla, suggested in a Dec. 28 post on X that a wealth tax would convince billionaires to flee the state. Conversely, the ballot initiative's proponents have pointed to studies debunking the idea that higher taxes result in the migration of significant numbers of wealthy people and businesses.Business leaders including Google co-founder Larry Page and venture capitalist Peter Thiel reportedly considered leaving California before the end of 2025 to avoid the tax proposal, according to a Dec. 26 article in The New York Times. Neither Page nor Thiel has since publicly announced a personal change of residence, and spokespeople for each billionaire didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, whose Pershing Square hedge fund is based in New York, criticized wealth taxes more broadly in a Dec. 29 post on X, writing that they \"effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences.\" Billionaire investor Mark Cuban — who has said he's \"proud to pay\" a large annual tax bill, but is opposed to taxing unrealized capital gains — wrote \"agree\" in response to Ackman's post.California's Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom has also stated his opposition to state-level wealth taxes, like the one proposed. If the California initiative garners enough signatures, Newsom and the state legislature could potentially try to block it from appearing on the November ballot by filing an emergency petition with the California Supreme Court.Huang, however, was adamant that he still sees Nvidia's location in Santa Clara, California, as a major benefit. \"We work in Silicon Valley because that's where the talent pool is,\" he said. The company's ability to hire qualified employees is typically the biggest factor in deciding where the company establishes a presence, he added.\"Wherever there's talent, we have offices,\" said Huang.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 7, 2026. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday shared new U.S. nutrition guidelines, advising Americans to eat more \"real food\" and reduce their intake of highly processed foods and added sugars.The government's new food pyramid replaces the MyPlate diagram released under President Barack Obama, and emphasizes protein, full-fat dairy and vegetables. The most significant changes under the updated guidelines include prioritizing protein over carbohydrates, recommending full-fat dairy instead of low-fat options, and cutting out processed foods like white bread, chips and candy.\"Healthy fats\" like full-fat dairy and avocados have also been added to the pyramid, and the guidelines recommend cooking with olive oil, butter or beef tallow. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday.Similarly, the website announcing the new guidelines declares, \"We are ending the war on protein.\"Kennedy called the new guidelines the \"most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"Source: HHSHis \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda has taken aim at processed foods and sugary beverages, while pushing more controversial dietary changes like cooking with beef tallow and consuming more red meat, which many public health experts say can lead to cardiovascular and other health issues in excess. The backbone of the MAHA platform is that healthier diets will prevent chronic disease, according to Kennedy.In response to the MAHA push, food and beverage giants like PepsiCo and J.M. Smucker have announced plans to phase out synthetic dyes and other artificial ingredients. Since Kennedy's confirmation, the industry has feared greater regulation, particularly regarding ultra-processed foods, although major policy changes haven't happened yet. The USDA and HHS release updated dietary guidelines every five years. While many Americans may brush off the recommendations, the guidelines are intended as a public health tool to inform health-care providers, federal agencies, policymakers and nutrition experts. The food industry also takes them into account, given the wide reach of the guidelines. Changes in the dietary recommendations will trickle down to school lunches and federal nutrition programs. The consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest estimates that 1 in 4 Americans will be directly affected by changes in the guidelines. More than a year ago, an advisory committee of health and nutrition experts said that Americans should eat more plant-based food and low-fat dairy and consume less red meat and sugary beverages, based on a review of scientific evidence. However, it is unclear if the USDA and HHS used the report to inform the dietary guidelines announced on Wednesday.",

Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's allies on Capitol Hill are downplaying his threats to take over Greenland by force. To them it's just the art of the deal -- hinting back to his popular 1987 book.Republicans largely fell in line after Trump over the weekend ordered a strike that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro without congressional approval. Now, as Trump refuses to rule out military action to annex Greenland, some members of the GOP say his aggressive posturing is a bluff to secure a deal that gives the U.S. more influence over the Arctic island.\"He's from New York, he's one of the best negotiators and how he negotiates sometimes is everything is on the table,\" Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump's Secretary of the Interior in his first term, said in an interview with CNBC. \"I think [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio is correct in that he's downplaying that we're gonna land the Marines on Greenland,\" Zinke said. \"I'd be supportive of negotiating a deal with Denmark to make sure that it stays influenced in the West.\"Trump has long coveted Greenland, a self-governing island territory of NATO ally Denmark. He has argued U.S. influence over the island is critical to national security for deterring Russian and Chinese aggression. The president has doubled down on his efforts to make the island part of the U.S. after the Venezuela raid that captured Maduro and hauled him to New York to face criminal drug charges. Read more CNBC coverage on GreenlandWhy Trump wants Greenland — and what makes it so important for national securityTrump weighs using U.S. military to acquire Greenland: White HouseResolution to block Trump from invading Greenland introduced by Sen. GallegoPrediction markets show rising odds Trump seizes Panama Canal, moves on GreenlandTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island’s economy faces ‘major challenges’\"The President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief's disposal,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday of the Greenland plan. The effort has rattled European leaders and enraged Denmark, which, along with Greenland, has repeatedly denied Trump's overtures. \"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,\" wrote Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland in a joint statement earlier this week.Moderate Republicans have taken solace in the idea that Trump is only negotiating, as Zinke argued. Maintaining the NATO alliance remains paramount on Capitol Hill. \"Obviously there is strategic national security importance to it with respect to the Arctic, with respect to NATO, with respect to combating Russia,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.\"If you can enter into negotiations with Denmark, with Greenland, great. The idea of taking it by force, no … there is strong bipartisan opposition to any use of force with respect to Greenland,\" Lawler said. Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) speaks to reporters ahead of a vote to pass the American Relief Act on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., Dec. 19, 2024. Anna Rose Layden | ReutersRep. Nick LaLota, another New York Republican, agreed: \"To Trump, everything is a deal, everything is a negotiation, a lot of things come down to leverage and I think his administration is comfortable with the term about not taking any options off the table, I hope we don't read too much into that.\"Democrats have erupted at the prospect that Trump could invade Greenland with the military, warning it would shatter the NATO alliance that has propped up U.S. and European security since World War II. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz, on Tuesday said he plans to introduce a resolution known as a War Powers Resolution to block Trump from ordering military action. And Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said in an interview with CNBC that he's working on a new War Powers Resolution in the House. \"The people around him need to stage an intervention,\" McGovern said. \"He wants to destroy and blow up our NATO alliances … he's just not well, the stuff that he's saying is so damaging to our country.\" Some Republicans agree with Democrats. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., called Trump's actions in Greenland \"appalling.\"\"It's creating a lot of long-term anger and hurt with our friends in Europe,\" Bacon said. \"I feel like we have a bunch of high school kids playing Risk.\"And Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., issued a joint statement with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., arguing that \"Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our Alliance exists to defend.\"Even Trump's allies generally agree that any military action would require congressional approval. They have argued the action that captured Maduro did not, since the U.S. was carrying out a law enforcement function. \"This would require congressional authorization,\" Zinke said. \"It doesn't meet the litmus test on Venezuela or some of the other ones that he's talked about.\"Trump, in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, said, \"RUSSIA AND CHINA HAVE ZERO FEAR OF NATO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES, AND I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM.\"\"We will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us,\" he said. Powerful House Republicans on Capitol Hill, for now, are sticking by Trump as he pursues Greenland -- continuing to insist the threats are all part of his negotiation strategy. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., said the \"post World War 2 order is not over in any way whatsoever.\"\"There's not a goal to break up NATO right now, there's looking to say, is there a good deal that can be made for what is a very strategic location, not just for the United States of America, but for others,\" he said. CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Justin Papp contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. should bar large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans.\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday.\"It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" he added.Private equity giants, real estate investment trusts and other large institutional investors have amassed sizable portfolios of single-family rental homes over the past decade. Many have argued that these investments have reduced housing supply for would-be homeowners and helped drive up prices. Invitation Homes, which is the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, tumbled 6%. Shares of Blackstone, an investing firm that owns and rents single-family homes, dropped more than 5%. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management also declined over 5%.The national median existing single-family home price was $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025 after hitting a record high of $435,300 in the summer, according to the National Association of Realtors. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily.Blackstone was the largest private-equity owner of apartments in the U.S. with more than 230,000 units, according to data from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project released last year. Blackstone in recent years has spent billions acquiring real estate companies such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities.Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. Trump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.Senator Tim Scott, head of the committee overseeing housing in the Senate, said while he embraced Trump's push for affordability, the better way to go forward would be his bipartisan \"ROAD to Housing\" bill.\"2026 must be the year we get housing affordability right for working families. I welcome President Trump's desire to look for ways to create more homeowners, especially first-time homeowners,\" Scott said in a statement to CNBC's Emily Wilkins. \"My focus is on advancing meaningful solutions that expand housing supply and lower costs — including building on our unanimously passed ROAD to Housing Act — because that's how we make the American Dream more attainable.\"— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Future Decoded Tech Summit in Bengaluru, India, on Feb. 25, 2020. Microsoft will open a new data-center region in Spain, expanding their strategic partnership with Telefonica SA, according the the statement by Telefonica.Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has identified itself as the mystery company behind a prospective data center in a part of Michigan where locals have objected to such a development. On Wednesday, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure team was named in a letter, published by Lowell Charter Township, as the party eyeing a 237-acre lot beside Interstate 96. The township, with a population of around 6,500, is located 20 miles southeast of Grand Rapids.The letter came after weeks of speculation about who was collaborating with developer Franklin Partners for the controversial project. Franklin, based in Illinois, had previously said it was working with a national company based in the U.S. to build a data center on the land. In December, locals crowded into a planning commission meeting, where a public hearing on the proposed rezoning was on the agenda, leading to the postponement of the event. News outlet MLive reported that a Grand Rapids business owner appeared in a Mr. Peanut costume and held up a sign saying \"This is nuts.\" Some in the area have said the township was moving too quickly to rezone the land, given the absence of clarity surrounding issues like energy requirements to operate the facility. Days after the canceled meeting, local officials said they were temporarily holding off on moving forward with the project.\"We are introducing ourselves now because we have observed that the community would like more information about the proposal, and we believe it is important to be transparent about our intentions moving forward,\" Microsoft said in Wednesday's letter. \"We asked the seller to pause the rezone process so that we could spend time with the community early this year and share more about our potential long-term plans before we proceed.\"Microsoft is set to nearly double the size of its data center portfolio in the next two years, CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in October. It's among a group of industry heavyweights, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Oracle, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI, rushing to spin up data centers packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units and other infrastructure needed to run powerful artificial intelligence models and workloads. Tech's megacaps are collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to capital expenditures, raising concerns that they're fueling another industry bubble. Utilities in some U.S. markets have said they won't be able to supply the energy needed for these planned data centers, which has made site selection more difficult. Residents living near the sites of proposed facilities have been pushing back, citing a range of concerns.Water use is one of the key issues. The Michigan township said it has an agreement with the nearby city of Lowell to provide a path for increased \"capacity of the plant at no additional cost to rate payers.\" Consumers Energy, a utility serving millions of Michiganders, has said data centers will not lead to higher electricity rates.The lot in the Covenant Business Park in the township is zoned as industrial planned unit development, and has sat empty, in part because of a lack of water and sewer services. The township's board would have to approve to change the zoning to light industrial for the project to advance.The development would result in $500 million to $1 billion in investment over the course of three to five years, the township said.The planning commission is set to meet again on Jan. 12.

    "body": "watch nowU.S. President Donald Trump is fixated on taking control of Greenland, a vast, sparsely populated and mineral-rich island situated between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. \"It's so strategic,\" Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday. \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.\" His comments, which came hot on the heels of an audacious military operation in Venezuela, sounded the alarm across Europe, with Denmark warning that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of the NATO military alliance.The U.S. president, however, is yet to waver. Indeed, the White House ramped up trans-Atlantic tensions even further on Tuesday, saying that Trump and his team are considering \"a range of options\" to make the self-governing Danish territory a part of the United States — including \"utilizing the U.S. Military.\" Positioned between the U.S. and Russia, Greenland has long been viewed as an area of high strategic importance, particularly when it comes to Arctic security.  The territory of nearly 57,000 people is in close proximity to emerging Arctic shipping routes, with the rapid melting of ice creating opportunities to substantially reduce Asia-Europe travel time when compared with the Suez Canal.Greenland also sits astride the so-called GIUK Gap, a naval choke point between Greenland, Iceland and the U.K. that links the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean. Alongside its strategic geopolitical position, Greenland is known for an abundance of untapped raw materials, from oil and gas reserves to critical mineral deposits and a treasure trove of rare earth elements. AFP | Getty ImagesThese critical minerals and rare earth elements are vital components in emerging technologies, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, energy storage technologies and national security applications. China repeatedly sought to leverage its near monopoly of rare earths to exert pressure on the U.S. last year.\"Trump is a real estate guy,\" Clayton Allen, head of practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, told CNBC by video call.\"Greenland is sitting on some of the most valuable real estate in terms of economic advantage and strategic defense for the next three to five decades.\" Shipping routes To be sure, the U.S. already has a presence in Greenland. The Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, is located in the northwest of Greenland, just across the Baffin Bay from Nunavut, Canada.It is estimated that around 150 U.S. service members are permanently stationed there, down from around 6,000 during the Cold War era.watch now\"For good reasons, the U.S. has an early warning air base in northwestern Greenland because the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach the continental United States is via Greenland and the North Pole,\" said Otto Svendsen, associate fellow with the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. The base, which also has an active airfield and is home to the world's northernmost deep-water port, has traditionally been pivotal to the monitoring of Russian submarines traversing the GIUK Gap, Svendsen said. \"A more recent and emerging threat or factor is the fact that Greenland straddles two potential shipping routes through the Arctic, the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route,\" Svendsen told CNBC by telephone. \"And as climate change continues to render those routes more viable, there are commercial interests there as well that add to the national security value of the island,\" he added.A fishing boat navigates around icebergs that broke off from the Jakobshavn Glacier and are floating in Disko Bay on March 10, 2025, in Ilulissat, Greenland.Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. 'Golden Dome' Analysts say Greenland could prove useful to the U.S. as a staging ground for a greater defensive presence and as a location for U.S. missile interceptors — particularly in the context of one of the Trump administration's key policies: a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.The multibillion-dollar initiative, rolled out in May last year and often compared to Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system, is a visionary plan designed to shield the U.S. from all missile attacks. Read more\"The U.S. needs access to the Arctic and it doesn't really have that much direct access today. Greenland has a tremendous amount. The U.S. needs air defenses deployed closer and closer to Russia to combat next-generation weapons that are not currently defensible with what we have available. Greenland provides that,\" Eurasia Group's Allen said. \"Trump wants to build a Golden Dome over the U.S.,\" he continued. \"Part of that is going to have to depend on Greenland.\" National or economic security? For some, Trump's assertion that annexing Greenland is a core part of U.S. national security has raised eyebrows. The declaration marks a notable shift in tone from almost a year ago, when the then president-elect cited \"economic security\" as a primary factor for annexing the island. Marion Messmer, director of the International Security Programme at London's Chatham House think tank, acknowledged that it is true to say that both Russia and China have increased their military activities in the Arctic in recent years — and, if Moscow launched missiles at the U.S., they would likely fly over Greenland.  \"However, what is not clear is why Washington needs full control over Greenland to defend itself,\" Messmer said in a written analysis published Tuesday. watch nowShe cited the fact that the U.S. already has a presence at Pituffik Space Base, as well as a decades-old defense agreement with Denmark that allows Washington to continue to use it. \"During the Cold War, the US stationed up to 6,000 troops across a range of camps across the island,\" Messmer said. \"It could presumably surge troop presence again if it felt it needed a greater presence in the region – without disputing Danish sovereignty.\"",

    "body": "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.Klaudia Radecka | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle and Character.AI will settle with families who sued the companies over harm to minors, including suicides, allegedly caused by artificial intelligence chatbots. According to court documents filed this week, the families and companies have agreed to work out settlement terms.In one case, plaintiff Megan Garcia sued Google and Character.AI after her son died from suicide. The complaint claims that Character.AI's chatbot engaged the plaintiff's 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, in harmful interactions, and alleges negligence, wrongful death, deceptive trade practices and product liability.\"Parties have agreed to a mediated settlement in principle to resolve all claims between them in the above-referenced matter,\" one filing says. \"The Parties request that this matter be stayed so that the Parties may draft, finalize, and execute formal settlement documents.\"The settlement agreements this week also came from families in Colorado, Texas and New York, according to documents. Details have not yet been revealed.In August 2024, Google agreed to a $2.7 billion licensing deal and hired Character.AI founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, who both previously worked at the search company and were specifically named in the lawsuits. Shazeer and De Freitas joined Google's AI unit DeepMind.In the more than three years since OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT kicked off the generative AI boom, the technology has rapidly evolved from text-based chats to sophisticated pictures, videos and characters that respond to simple human prompts. Companies in the space now face the heightened challenge of dealing with the potential harmful consequences of the technology.Families have filed a flurry of cases involving suicides and deaths by people who turned to these products for companionship and therapy. In October, Character.AI announced that it would ban users under age 18 from having free-ranging chats, including romantic and therapeutic conversations, with its AI chatbots.A spokesman for the lawyer representing families involved in this week's settlement said the plaintiffs had no comment. Google couldn't be reached for comment, while Character.AI said it couldn't comment at this time. Google's advancements in AI contributed to it being the top megacap performer on Wall Street in 2025. The company launched the latest version of its tensor processing unit chips in November and its Gemini 3 chatbot last month.

    "body": "Jim Farley, president and chief executive officer of Ford, speaks at the Ford Motor Co.'s Kentucky Truck Plant to launch the 2025 Ford Expedition, in Louisville, Kentucky, April 30, 2025.Carolyn Kaster | APFord Motor plans to introduce eyes-off driving technology on an upcoming $30,000 all-electric vehicle in 2028, the Detroit automaker announced Wednesday.The target brings Ford into a race against competitors such as Tesla, General Motors and Rivian Automotive to develop and broadly launch such systems, which Wall Street views as a potential growth market to fully autonomous vehicles. Ford's plan is similar to those of other automakers, but the company notably plans to offer the new system on a mainstream EV first, rather than on a pricier model — defying typical technology rollouts in the automotive industry.\"It's part of what has evolved to be a broader technology strategy of putting our best and newest technology where the volume is and where the accessibility is,\" Doug Field, Ford's chief EV, digital and design officer, told CNBC during an interview.The first vehicle to feature the new system is expected to be built on the company's upcoming \"Universal EV platform,\" which Ford has said is capable of supporting a variety of vehicles. The first is a roughly $30,000 midsize pickup truck set to hit the market in 2027. watch nowField, who joined Ford after stints with Apple and Tesla, said the first vehicle with the eyes-off system will come at that starting price, but did not disclose if it would be the pickup truck.Ford has said the next-generation EV platform reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% fewer fasteners, 40% fewer workstations in the plant and 15% faster assembly time.Field announced the eyes-off system at the CES technology show in Las Vegas alongside other plans, including a new vehicle software architecture as well as a Ford-engineered artificial intelligence assistant. GM in October announced similar plans, including an AI assistant and an eyes-off system expected to launch in 2028 on its electric Cadillac Escalade IQ. That vehicle currently starts at more than $127,000.SkunkworksFord, led by CEO Jim Farley, is under pressure to deliver on the new vehicle platform, known as UEV, and its supporting technologies, which largely fall under Field.The company has wasted billions of dollars amid shifting EV strategies as well as quality and production issues in recent years.Ford has significantly cut back its spending on EVs and has moved focus from large all-electric pickup trucks and SUVs to smaller, more affordable models through a special project, or \"skunkworks,\" team that created the UEV platform. Ford announced plans to invest about $5 billion in U.S. plants to produce the vehicles and the batteries to power them.watch nowField referred to the skunkworks team as a \"bet\" over the last couple of years that has \"started to build a tremendous amount of confidence\" over the \"last few months.\" He said Ford now has all of the critical software and supporting hardware it needs in-house for a new generation of technologically advanced vehicles to differentiate the automaker.\"One of the things we're seeing is just how much faster our development process works on this product and this architecture compared to what we've done in the past,\" Field said. \"So, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to get this out.\"Ford last month said it expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items through 2027 related to such restructuring efforts and its pullback in EV investments.Eyes-off drivingField said Ford's planned eyes-off system, which the auto industry refers to as \"Level 3 driving automation,\" will utilize an array of sensors and in-house software development to lower costs compared to competitors. Field declined to comment on the roadmap for expanding the new system to other vehicles, but said the goal is to commoditize the technology. \"The actual rollout schedule will be based on a lot of work we have to do on which customers need it in their applications, when, and which products are most ready for it now,\" Field said. \"It'll take time to roll it out everywhere, but we'll prioritize that based on where we will have the biggest impact on customers.\"Ford's BlueCruise system displayed on the driver information cluster of an F-150 pickup truck.FordSAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, has characterized automated driving for vehicles from Level 0 to Level 5. The highest, Level 5, is a fully autonomous vehicle, with each stage from Level 0 adding more technologies and enabling human drivers to be more \"out of the loop.\"Ford currently offers a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS, known as BlueCruise. While active, a vehicle can drive itself under certain circumstances without human intervention on divided highways, but drivers still need to pay attention to the roads and system in case of problems.  AI assistant, new vehicle 'brain'Ford's new AI assistant is expected to launch in early 2026 through its phone apps for Ford and Lincoln, followed by a native in-vehicle experience starting in 2027, the company said Wednesday. Several other automakers also have announced plans for AI digital assistants, but Field said he believes Ford's will offer unique capabilities specific to each car or truck by utilizing each vehicle's unique identification number.Ford said the AI assistant will be able to review a picture of a trailer to confirm whether a vehicle can properly tow it, for example, or assess how many bags of mulch the interior of a car or truck can hold. \"The AI companion is something we think we can make special for Ford, representative of what we're trying to do on the customer experience side,\" Field said.Assisting in that better customer experience is expected to be an updated in-house software architecture that Ford's calling an \"integrated digital platform\" that will debut with the UEV platform.The company said the updated system will result in \"a more unified 'brain inside' the vehicle — a single, powerful module that unifies infotainment, ADAS, audio, and networking.\"\"For customers, that means a vehicle that feels more consistent, more reliable, and more capable year after year,\" Field said in a blog post accompanying the CES announcements.",

    "body": "watch nowAlaska Airlines is ordering more than 100 Boeing jets, a purchase that the carrier's fleet chief said will ensure it has locked in sought-after order slots through the middle of the next decade to expand. The order, Alaska's largest ever, which was announced Wednesday, includes 105 yet-to-be-certified Boeing 737 Max 10 jets. Alaska is also buying five 787-10 Dreamliners, using its previous purchase options for those long-haul jets as it charts an international expansion with nonstops to Italy, South Korea and elsewhere. Shane Jones, who oversees Alaska Airlines' fleet, revenue products and real estate, told CNBC that the airline expects FAA certification of the Max 10 this year, with deliveries beginning in 2027. Alaska, which acquired Hawaiian Airlines in 2024, said it has 413 aircraft in its fleet and plans to grow that to 475 in 2030 and 550 by 2035, with this and previous orders.Read more CNBC airline newsWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentThe new order includes options for 35 more 737 Max 10s. Fifty-three of the planes in Wednesday's order are new, and 52 are from options the airline is exercising.Boeing has more than 6,000 aircraft on backorder, but Alaska's purchase plans are a vote of confidence in airplane maker, whose 737 factory 10 miles away from the carrier's headquarters handed Alaska a 737 Max 9 two years ago without key bolts installed in a door plug. That panel blew out of the plane on Jan. 5, 2024, as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon, stunning travelers, though there were no serious physical injuries.The accident briefly grounded the 737 Max 9 and set Boeing back in production as it waded through another safety crisis during what was supposed to be its turnaround year in the wake of two deadly Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner passenger aircraft with Alaska Airlines' new aircraft livery during a media event at the Boeing Delivery Center in Seattle, Washington, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026.M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnder Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who replaced insider Dave Calhoun months after the accident, the manufacturer has improved its production rate and quality, airline executives have said. It plans to ramp up production this year. The FAA must approve Boeing's Max production increases, a requirement following the door plug accident.Alaska's Jones told CNBC Wednesday's order is a sign of \"our confidence in the Max 10 certification\" as well as \"our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.\"The 737 Max 10 has a shorter range than some other models but it can fit more passengers than smaller variants, which can improve unit costs on high-demand flights and allows them to fly more customers in and out of congested airports where adding flights is challenging. The Max 10 is years behind schedule and is still awaiting FAA approval. Jones said he expects certification this year with the first deliveries of the variant in the first half of 2027.Jones said about half of the new aircraft orders are for replacement, with the rest for growth. He declined to disclose how much the airline paid for the aircraft. Manufacturers often share list prices, though big customers generally receive discounts for large orders.",

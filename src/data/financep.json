    "body": "European markets traded firmly in the red on Friday morning as concerns over the banking sector reached the region.The Pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.5% lower at 8:26 a.m. in London (3:26 a.m. ET), with all major indexes and sectors in negative territory. The U.K.'s FTSE index was 1.5% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 0.7%, while Germany's DAX and Italy's FTSE MIB both fell over 2%.It comes as spillover from the U.S. banking sector hit European stocks on Friday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index sliding around 2.8%.In the U.S. on Thursday, shares of regional banks and investment bank Jefferies tumbled as fears mounted around some bad loans lurking on Wall Street.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon Stoxx Europe 600 Banks IndexElsewhere in the banking sector, Spanish bank BBVA's attempted hostile takeover of Sabadell failed on Thursday, when it failed to convince shareholders to back the 16.32 million euro ($19.1 million) bid. BBVA shares rose 5.7% on Friday as investors reacted to the news, while Sabadell's fell 6.1%.Defense stocks are also in the spotlight after it was announced that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be meeting in Hungary to discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine.The Stoxx Europe Total Market Aerospace and Defense index was over 3% lower on Friday.It marks a stark change for the banking and defense sectors, which have been bright spots in the European equities rally this year.

    "body": "watch nowA Republican bill to end the government shutdown failed in the Senate for the 10th time on Thursday, leaving lawmakers at a stalemate as the lapse in federal funding stretched into its third week.  The resolution came up short in a 51-45 vote that fell mostly along party lines. Sixty senators are needed to approve any stopgap bill; Republicans hold a narrow 53-seat majority in the Senate.Earlier Thursday, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly called on President Donald Trump to get involved in the negotiations between Republican and Democratic senators to break the impasse.\"I think we need the president to make that happen, that he needs to engage with Mike Johnson and John Thune,\" Kelly said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" referring to the Republicans who are the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader, respectively.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything. That's the way this ends,\" the Arizona senator said.The sticking point in passing a funding deal is that Democrats insist that any such bill extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025.A Democratic bill to keep in place those extra subsidies, which about 22 million Americans use to reduce the cost of their Obamacare health plans, is expected to cost nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade.\"The president has talked about how he wants this fixed. He wants these subsidies to be dealt with,\" Kelly said.\"So he agrees we should open the government and we should fix the subsidy issue under the Affordable Care Act, and that's all we want,\" Kelly said. \"So I don't see what the issue is.\"Thune and other Republicans have said they would be willing to discuss whether to extend enhanced ACA tax credits after a short-term funding extension is approved.In an interview Thursday with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Thune said, \"We are happy to sit down and talk about a solution on the ACA, tax credits, but that needs to happen in a separate context, you know, away from having the government open.\"Johnson, in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, said, \"This is not a health care fight. This is a very simple funding fight. It always was.\"\"They have created a red herring. The subsidies don't expire until the end of the year,\" Johnson said.\"We were always planning to have the thoughtful debate and deliberation over that in the month of October and November, before the subsidies expired. They know that. They grabbed that issue from the end of the year and pulled it back into September to try to pretend like that was the issue. It never was,\" Johnson said.The speaker also said there \"needs a dramatic amount of reform\" with the ACA subsidies, \"if indeed they're going to be extended.\"Punchbowl News reported on Thursday that \"there's a bipartisan group of senators discussing several different potential off-ramps\" to the shutdown stalemate \"involving the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\"\"The group, led in part by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), is discussing the possibility of holding two side-by-side votes intended to end the shutdown,\" Punchbowl reported, cited people familiar with the matter.\"The first vote would be to reopen the government, while the second would be on a one-year extension of the Obamacare enhanced premium tax credits, plus a commitment to pass a longer-term solution by a date certain.\"",

    "body": "LONDON — EU heads of state will call for quicker action on the use of immobilized Russian assets at a meeting next week amid growing pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a document seen by CNBC.The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has been looking at how to use about 175 billion euros ($204 billion) in cash that has matured from frozen Russian assets held in Europe to further support Ukraine's coffers. The Trump administration has pushed its G-7 counterparts, which include Italy, France, and Germany, to seize billions in frozen Russian assets, according to the Financial Times. So far, European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv, but some countries have been concerned about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues.\"The European Council is committed to finding ways to help address Ukraine's pressing needs for 2026-2027, including for its military and defense efforts. It therefore calls on the commission to present as soon as possible concrete proposals involving the possible use of the cash balances associated with the immobilized Russian assets,\" a draft document seen by CNBC stated. The document forms the basis for conversations among the 27 EU heads of state due to gather in Brussels Thursday.Belgium has been particularly tough on the subject, given that it hosts Euroclear – the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belgium's leadership is concerned about the legal implications once the war is over and wants EU countries to commit to burden-sharing the responsibilities.\"In this context, the European Council stresses the importance of ensuring fair burden-sharing and coordination of efforts with G7 partners,\" the document seen by CNBC, and which is the basis for an agreement next week, states.watch nowValerie Urbain, CEO of Euroclear, told CNBC earlier this month that her job is also to draw leaders' attention to the implications of their decisions.\"We have been extremely vocal in making sure that we respect the rule of law,\" Urbain said, adding it is a question of ensuring investors do not lose confidence in investing in Europe.\"One thing which is extremely important is that we continue to be attractive for international investors, and especially when you see the gigantic financing needs of Europe in order to support, European sovereignty, in order to support transition to the greener economy, digital innovation, we really need to remain very attractive to external investors,\" she said.Next week's meeting comes at a time of increased pressure on European governments to support Ukraine after Trump dialled back on the U.S.' financial and military support to Kyiv. Data from the Kiel Institute, showed that between July and August, Ukraine received about 7.5 billion euros in financial and humanitarian support. Of the newly allocated funds, 86% came from EU institutions.The U.K., France and Germany came together last week calling for more action to support Ukraine. \"We are ready to progress towards using, in a coordinated way, the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine's armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table,\" they said in a statement.",

Eric Lee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRegulators are doing away with controversial rules that required banks to plan for losses in the event of climate-related events, according to an announcement Thursday.A joint release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve said they no longer believe the requirements are necessary as they are redundant with other provisions banks make to plan for emergencies and unusual events.\"The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities,\" a joint release from the three regulators said.Fed Governor Michael Barr, the former vice chair for supervision, issued a statement disagreeing with the move.\"Rescinding the principles is shortsighted and will make the financial system riskier even as climate-related financial risks grow,\" Barr said in a statement.Mission creepTrump administration officials have criticized the Fed for falling prey to mission creep, or exceeding the scope of its mandates for monetary policy and bank supervision. The climate change provisions, established in October 2023, were one point of criticism.Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that climate is not a direct Fed issue. The rules required banks, as part of routine testing, to list potential losses they might suffer from climate-related issues.Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee who succeeded Barr as the Fed banking supervisor, praised the move rescinding the rules as part of an attempt at \"refocusing the supervisory process on material financial risk.\"\"Rescission of the climate principles is an important step in this process,\" Bowman said. She criticized the climate rules, saying \"the effect of this guidance was to create confusion about supervisory expectations and increase compliance cost and burden without a commensurate improvement to the safety and soundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States.\"While acknowledging the risks that climate change poses, Bowman said the Fed's mission does \"not extend to climate policymaking.\"",

    "body": "Jefferies headquarters in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023.Jeenah Moon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStock Chart IconStock chart iconZION and KRE, 1-dayThe bankruptcies of two auto industry-related companies this year have raised concerns about loose lending practices, especially in the opaque private credit market. That's left both the banking industry and investors concerned about whether instances of loans gone wrong indicate a burgeoning crisis.The latest signs of trouble came when Zions said Wednesday evening it faced a sizable charge because of bad loans to a couple of borrowers. Despite expecting this was an isolated incident, the bank said that it will encourage its counsel to have an independent review.Western Alliance then alleged Thursday a borrower had committed fraud. That rattled investors despite the company saying it could reaffirm its guidance and 2025 outlook.\"While  we  are  questioning  why  all  of  these  credit  'one offs'  are  seemingly occurring in a short period of time, the reality is that even though these exposures may be 'well-contained' and have a 'limited financial impact,' this is an industry where investors — especially those that are new to this sector — tend to 'sell first and ask questions later,' especially when it comes to elevated credit concerns,\" JPMorgan banking analyst Anthony Elian wrote in a Thursday note to clients.Looking for 'cockroaches'The worries about the health of the banking industry originated with the bankruptcies of companies related to the auto sector: First Brands and Tricolor Holdings.Auto parts maker First Brands went bankrupt last month and announced this week that founder Patrick James stepped down as chief executive. The Ohio-based company is facing a Justice Department criminal investigation, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Shares of Jefferies, which has exposure to First Brands, fell more than 10% on Thursday. The investment bank's stock has lost more 25% in October, making it poised to record its worst month since the Covid pandemic took hold in March 2020.Jefferies said that hedge funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies tied to First Brands, while UBS said that it has about $500 million in exposure.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on the company's earnings conference call earlier this week in relation to First Brands and Tricolor Holdings fallout.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJEF, 1-monthJPMorgan did not have exposure to First Brands, but did take a $170 million charge-off last quarter from Tricolor.\"I asked Jamie Dimon the question about these problems, and you heard, when you see one cockroach, there's probably a few more,\" said Mike Mayo, senior banking analyst at Wells Fargo. \"Investors are looking around for cockroaches. That's what's happening.\"An 'opaque' marketMayo said credit quality in the overall industry is still considered favorable. However, he said the recent developments show the low margin for error when there's hiccups in the credit market.Additionally, because the private credit market is so \"opaque,\" there can be a \"major wave of concern without really knowing if there is even a problem,\" said Peter Corey of Pave Finance.This week's lending revelations mark the latest challenge in recent years for regional banks. The industry went through a crisis in 2023 that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Alternative and other asset managers also suffered in the Thursday downdraft resulting from concern about the health of some loans.Blue Owl Capital dropped more than 7%, while Ares Management and Blackstone fell more than 6% and 3%, respectively. Apollo Global Management lost more than 5% and Carlyle Group declined around 4%.To be sure, the declines in major banks were relatively subdued Thursday. JPMorgan shed more than 2%, while Bank of America lost around 3.5%.A bull market in stocks and the booming private credit market this year has calmed investors nerves about whether there is a systemic crisis emerging. The stock market Thursday appeared to be dragged lower by the decline in regional banks, leading the S&P 500 to finish lower.\"Today, I think, the risk to the bank space is idiosyncratic,\" said Timothy Coffey, associate director of depository research at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"The risk to the insured bank space for private credit could be more systemic, as well as the risk to credit quality from a weakening economy.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son, John Melloy and Scott Schnipper contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowAs news of sour banks loans rattled Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the developments will pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates — a move that investors across the board have been hoping for.\"Today got real ugly, but at least we finally have something that can make the Federal Reserve itchy to cut interest rates sooner rather than later: bank loans gone bad,\" he said. \"Nothing motivates the Fed to move faster than credit losses, because they're a definitive sign that the economy is going south.\"The averages dipped during Thursday's session as fears about the health of regional banks' lending business grew. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite finished down 0.5%, lead by declines in bank stocks.Worries about lending practices — especially in the private credit market — ramped up recently after two auto industry related outfits, Tricolor and First Brands, filed for bankruptcy. Zions Bancorporation disclosed a $50 million loss on two commercial loans Wednesday evening, and then on Thursday, Western Alliance alleged that a borrower had committed fraud.These bad loans are early warning signs that it's time for the central bank to ease, Cramer said. He suggested the banking system has now \"provided us with enough questionable credits in one week's time\" that the Fed can quickly slash rates without worrying too much about inflation.While lower borrowing rates stimulate the economy generally, Cramer emphasized that they also make it easier for borrowers not to default.Cramer referenced comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon who earlier this month suggested the auto companies' bankruptcies were like cockroaches, saying \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Dimon's comments turned out to be prescient, Cramer indicated.But these credit issues may not hurt the broader market, Cramer suggested.\"Now, it's possible there's foul play involved in that multi-million problem of First Brands,\" he said. \"Doesn't matter, though: a bad loan is a bad loan is a bad loan, and that's good for the stock market because these bad loans won't hurt profits of anything other than the banks. The pain will be contained, I think.\"watch now",

    "body": "Ron Conway, founder of SV Angel, speaks during the TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2015 conference in New York on May 4, 2015.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDays after suggesting that President Donald Trump should send federal troops to San Francisco, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is facing some consequences.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday, CNBC has confirmed. Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an e-mailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in the New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard. According to the Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Conway is founder and managing partner of SV Angel, an early-stage venture firm. He has long been an advocate for tech in San Francisco, having founded trade organization sf.citi and helping start FWD.us, which focused on immigration reform.The Salesforce Foundation isn't his only connection to Benioff's philanthropic efforts. Conway is also a large donor to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.Conway didn't respond to a request for comment.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Conway has supported Newsom, including in 2021, when he opposed a recall effort against the Democratic governor.WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sits down with Jim Cramer at Dreamforce 2025watch now",

    "body": "Former National Security Adviser John Bolton speaks to reporters after speaking in a panel hosted by the National Council of Resistance of Iran – U.S. Representative Office (NCRI-US) at the Willard InterContinental Hotel on Aug. 17, 2022 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesJohn Bolton, a former national advisor to President Donald Trump and former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Maryland on charges of mishandling classified information.Bolton, 76, is the third high-profile Trump foe in recent weeks to be criminally charged after extensive criticism by the president.The 26-page indictment in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt charged the Republican with eight counts of transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of retention of national defense information.Bolton allegedly shared classified information with two relatives while he was Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019, and kept such information at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, after leaving that post.The indictment also says that someone suspected of being affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran obtained classified information after hacking into Bolton's personal email account, which he used to share that information with his relatives.The charges came nearly two months after FBI agents raided Bolton's home and office in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 22 as part of the criminal investigation.Two senior federal law enforcement sources told NBC News that Bolton is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday and then appear in court later in the day.Bolton said he was innocent and that he was being targeted in a manner akin to the Soviet Union's secret police under Stalin because of his outspoken opposition to Trump.His claim echoed what former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James said after they were separately indicted recently in Virginia following calls by Trump for them to be charged.\"These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,\" Bolton said of Trump, who previously was prosecuted for retaining classified documents after his first term in the White House.Trump told reporters at the White House that he had not known that Bolton had been indicted.\"You're telling me for the first time, but I think he's ... a bad person,\" Trump said. \"He's a bad guy. It's too bad. But that's the way it goes right? That's the way it goes.\"Bolton faces a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in prison on each count if convicted. But federal sentencing guidelines would recommend a punishment that would be much less severe.FBI agents carry boxes as they exit the building that houses the Washington office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 22, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersThe indictment says that Bolton, from 2018 until August 2025, shared \"more than a thousand pages of his day-to-day activities as the National Security Advisor — including information relating to the national defense which was classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI [sensitive compartmented information] level — with two unauthorized individuals\" who were relatives of his.Neither of those two people, who were identified by MSNBC as Bolton's wife and daughter, had security clearances, the indictment says.\"Bolton also unlawfully retained documents, writings, and notes relating to the national defense, including information classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI level, in his home,\" the indictment said.Bolton is accused of sending, through non-governmental messaging applications like AOL and Gmail, \"diary-like entries\" that contained information classified as top secret to his two relatives.In July 2021, a representative of Bolton told the FBI that a cyber hacker believed to be associated with Iran hacked Bolton's personal email account, according to the indictment.On July 25, 2021, Bolton received an email related to the hack, which threatened to notify the FBI about it.Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

No one is above the law,\" Bondi said.Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, in a statement, said, \"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago.\"\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career – records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said.\"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" Lowell said. \"We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information.\"Bolton, in his own statement, \"For four decades, I have devoted my life to America's foreign policy and national security. I would never compromise those goals.\"He said that \"Trump's retribution against me began then, continued when he tried unsuccessfully to block the publication of my book, The Room Where It Happened, before the 2020 election, and became one of his rallying cries in his re-election campaign. Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.\"Bolton also said that when his email was hacked, \"the FBI was made fully aware.''In four years of the prior administration, after these reviews, no charges were ever filed,\" Bolton said. \"Then came Trump 2 who embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.' \"\"Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America's constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom,\" Bolton said. \"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.\"",

    "body": "A shopper walks past shelves of cooking oil for sale at a supermarket in Beijing on October 15, 2025. Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs will cost global businesses upward of $1.2 trillion in 2025, with most of the cost being passed onto consumers, according to a new analysis from S&P Global.In a white paper released Thursday, the firm said its estimate of additional expenses for companies is probably conservative. The price tag comes from information provided by some 15,000 sell-side analysts across 9,000 companies who contribute to S&P and its proprietary research indexes.\"The sources of this trillion-dollar squeeze are broad. Tariffs and trade barriers act as taxes on supply chains and divert cash to governments; logistics delays and freight costs compound the effect,\" author Daniel Sandberg said in the report. \"Collectively, these forces represent a systemic transfer of wealth from corporate profits to workers, suppliers, governments, and infrastructure investors.\"Trump in April slapped 10% tariffs on all goods entering the U.S. and listed individual \"reciprocal\" tariffs for dozens of other countries. Since then, the White House has entered a series of negotiations and agreements while also adding duties on a variety of individual items such as kitchen cabinets, autos and timber.While administration officials have insisted that exporters will be forced to bear the greater share of the levies, the S&P analysis suggests that is only partly true.In fact, the firm says that just one-third will be borne by companies, with the rest falling on the shoulders of consumers, under conservative estimates. The figures incorporated a $907 billion hit to covered companies with the remainder to uncovered firms as well as private equity and venture capital.\"With real output declining, consumers are paying more for less, suggesting that this two-thirds share represents a lower bound on their true burden,\" said Sandberg, who wrote the report along with Drew Bowers, a senior quantitative analyst at S&P Global.Political and policy stakesThe size of the tariff hit and the burden of the costs are critical both for the White House looking to sell the duties as essential to restoring a fair trade balance, and to policymakers at the Federal Reserve looking to calibrate the proper balance for monetary policy.\"The President and Administration's position has always been clear: while Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America Last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States,\" he added.Fed officials have been inclined to look through the duties as a one-time hit to prices and not a source of underlying inflationary pressures. The S&P researchers found similar sentiment among analysts.The consensus looks for a 64 basis point contraction in profit margins this year, fading to 28 basis points for 2026 and then 8 to 10 basis points in 2027-28. A basis point equals 0.01%.\"In effect, 2025 locked in the hit; 2026 and 2027 will test whether the market's optimism about re-equilibration is warranted,\" the authors wrote. \"For now, consensus envisions a world where margins eventually recover to pre-tariff trajectories. Whether that faith proves justified will depend on how firms adapt through technology, cost discipline and reshaped global value chains that have defined this cycle.\"The impact also likely will depend on how Trump's tariff strategy evolves. The White House currently is back in heightened tensions with China over a rare earth dispute and Trump's intentions to retaliate.The S&P paper found that Trump's removal in May of the \"de minimis\" exception for goods under $800 was \"the real inflection point\" for how hard tariffs would bite. The exception had allowed low-priced goods to sail under previous tariff barriers, but \"had become politically untenable.\"\"When the exemption closed, the shock rippled through shipping data, earnings reports, and executive commentary,\" Sandberg said.\"In the optimistic scenario that this turbulence is temporary, the Trump administration's tariff agenda and the resulting supply chain realignments are viewed as transitory frictions, not permanent structural taxes on profitability,\" he added.",

    "body": "A sign is posted in front of a Genentech office on June 12, 2025 in South San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRoche's Genentech on Thursday said it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to certain patients at a discount in a bid to expand access, becoming the latest company to wade into the direct-to-consumer space. It follows similar moves by other drugmakers to simplify how Americans get their medicines, and comes as companies face pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Genentech's new program also launches ahead of the flu season, which typically peaks in the winter months. The 2024 to 2025 flu season was the most severe in more than a decade, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Genentech's new program aims to reach uninsured patients, those with limited coverage or people whose plans don't cover the pill, according to a release. The company will provide access to Xofluza through three pharmacies with a $50 cash pay option, which is 70% lower than the pill's current list price before insurance. That includes Mark Cuban's direct-to-consumer pharmacy Cost Plus Drug Company, Amazon Pharmacy and Fuze Health's Alto Pharmacy. Genentech said same-day home delivery is available in certain markets through the latter two pharmacies. Home mail delivery is also available nationwide through all three pharmacies for people who want to use Xofluza as a prevention treatment. The pill is a single-dose antiviral treatment for people ages 5 and above, typically taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. Xofluza costs over $150 for one treatment, according to some drug price websites. On top of the new effort, Genentech also offers a coupon that allows eligible patients to pay as little as $35 for their Xofluza prescription, with up to $70 off at most pharmacies.Trump in July sent letters to 17 drugmakers urging them to take specific steps to curb costs for patients, including by launching direct-to-consumer sales models for their medicines. Companies had to respond by Sept. 29. Since then, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have inked deals with Trump to lower drug prices. It was part of his effort to revive a controversial plan called the \"most favored nation\" policy, which aims to tie the prices of some drugs in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration imposing a $100,000 fee to the H-1B worker visas.Last month President Donald Trump announced plans that would see U.S. companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas -- which allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations in various fields, including technology and engineering -- in an attempt to rework the program.In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it \"overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\"\"The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,\" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years. The program is capped at 65,000 visas per year, with an additional carve out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees. Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.The administration has also proposed further changes to the H-1B program's lottery selection system.The changes have come in the months following Trump entering office and amid a push to limit immigration and see American companies hire more domestically.\"President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,\" Bradley said in the Thursday release.",

Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle shares ended Thursday trading up 3% as it called for more business in core categories and confirmed a cloud-computing deal with social media company Meta.The maker of database software sees $20 billion in artificial intelligence-powered database and AI data platform revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2025 and $3 billion in fiscal 2026.\"You see the change in these numbers that it's a little bit easier for us to find supply, not this year or next year, but in subsequent years,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two new CEOs, told analysts Thursday at the company's AI World conference in Las Vegas. \"So as we're able to find that supply, customers contract for it, we see immense demand, and then we go about delivering that to customers.\"Magouyrk said that in 30 days during the current quarter, Oracle contracted $65 billion in new cloud infrastructure commitments.\"It was across seven different contracts from four different customers,\" Magouyrk said. \"None of those customers are OpenAI. I know some people are questioning sometimes, 'Hey, is it just OpenAI? The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.\"Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, is one of the four customers, he said. Bloomberg reported in September that the two companies were discussing a $20 billion deal.The deal with Meta comes amid a flurry of spending by tech companies to invest in the infrastructure for their AI initiatives. Meta in July said that it expects to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion this year in capital expenditures.In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud infrastructure division that competes with the likes of Amazon and Google. At the same time, Oracle has started offering its database in clouds other than its own.Oracle secured a commitment from OpenAI in excess of $300 billion in July.AI infrastructure has an adjusted gross margin of 30% to 40% after land, data center, power and computing equipment costs, Oracle said. Earlier this month, The Information reported that Oracle saw a 14% gross margin on renting out Nvidia AI chips in the August quarter.\"I've read a lot of stories that are speculating that Oracle is chasing revenue for revenue's sake, but let's be crystal clear,\" said Doug Kehring, the company's principal financial officer. \"We only pursue opportunities where we have a clear line of sight to attractive market margins that reward us for intellectual property and the activity we bring to customers.\"After market close, Oracle said it's now targeting $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in revenue for fiscal 2030, representing a 31% compound annual growth rate. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $18.92 per share on $198.39 billion in revenue. The stock slipped 2% in extended trading.WATCH: Oracle kicks off its analyst day to outline deliverables and margin profilewatch now",

    "body": "Nearly a million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2025, per the U.K. Office for National Statistics.Hiraman | E+ | Getty ImagesYoung people are struggling to score their first jobs, and it might be because they're just not ready to enter the workforce, after missing out on critical social development during the Covid-19 pandemic. Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people \"aren't work ready\" when they enter full-time jobs after school. \"Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work.\" Generation Lockdown U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. \"You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,\" Leonard said. Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are \"so core to being work-ready,\" and Gen Z \"missed out.\"Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in \"sharp decline.\" \"There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,\" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. \"Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were \"critical\" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. \"We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,\" she said. In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of \"human-skills\" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. Ask for jobs in-person Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. \"It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,\" Leonard said. Walk into your local shop and ask for a job, advises Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust. Timnewman | E+ | Getty Images\"Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'\" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. \"You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,\" Leonard added. ",

    "body": "At the start of a new year, it's hard not to get swept up in the allure of New Year's resolutions: Setting goals you want to achieve or pinpointing the bad habits you want to break. For many people, breaking bad habits can be easier when you swap a not-so-great behavior out for a healthier option, Margaret Moore, founder of Wellcoaches Corporation, a school for coaches of healthcare and well-being experts, told CNBC Make It in 2023.Neuroscientist Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD, suggests trying \"tiny experiments\" with habits you'd like to introduce into your life instead of setting huge goals that can be unrealistic. It's significant to \"withhold judgment until you're done conducting your experiment,\" Le Cunff told CNBC Make It last week.In 2026, I'm simply looking to do less. My past few years have involved starting each day with a minimum of 10 items on my to-do list. This year I want to get that list down to five tasks, or less.I talked to my fellow CNBC Make It staff members about the bad habits they want to break this year and there were a few common themes. Here's what stood out.Screen time and tech\"A habit I would like to break this new year is waking up and reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. It's something that has been like muscle memory for such a long time now that I can't remember a time where I didn't wake up and immediately grab my phone and check messages or scroll on social media.\"\"I'd also like to do more mentally stimulating activities when I'm bored instead of just reaching for my phone or watching TV, or just doing things that aren't really challenging my mind in a way.\"— Ashton Jackson, Success Reporter\"I want to fix my sleep. I have not been sleeping right, and I want to fix that. I think I'm just not sleeping enough, and also being on a screen too much before bed. A lot of it is doom scrolling. My other thing is if I'm trying to read and wind down before bed, I read e-books and that screen issue has kind of been a thing too.\"— Sarah Jackson, Work Reporter\"I'm avoiding video games for January. So if I feel like going to play a video game, I play music or I'll read a book.\"— Mike Winters, Money Reporter'Revenge bedtime'Staying up late for extra free time, even when it cuts into the hours you'd otherwise use to sleep and feel rested the next day, is called revenge bedtime. \"It often happens when individuals feel they have little control over their daily schedules,\" according to the Sleep Foundation.\"I'm very bad about watching TV until like 12:30, so I want to have a harsh 'Get into bed,' no later than 11 [p.m.] And I think that will help me break a lot of other bad habits that I have. Like after work being too tired to be productive or do things, I think if I get my sleep on track, it will help with having energy to exercise or be productive after work.\"— Marisa Forziati, Video Editor\"Going to sleep earlier is a big one. It's just tough because with little kids, it's like after they go to sleep at 8' o clock then that feels like freedom. It's the push and pull of wanting to maximize that time with free time, but then also needing to go to sleep. Trying to find that balance of making space to unwind but also to get good rest.\"— Tom Huddleston Jr., Senior Success ReporterNo more abandoning healthy habits\"One habit that I want to stop doing is getting lazy about reading. That's like the hardest thing to force myself to do. I lowered my quota of books for the year to 10 from 12 because I was like maybe if it's 10, I'll actually do it.\"— Gili Malinsky, Lead Psychology Reporter\"Not skipping my workouts, eating sugar or pressing snooze. Trying to get up when the alarm goes off.\" — Kamaron McNair, Money Reporter\"Having less FOMO with my friends. Like if they're going out, I don't have to go this time. If I miss this one social plan, I'm not going to lose this friend, I don't think. I hope not. I have a hard time saying no to invitations to things.\"— Raffi Paul, Video Producer\"I'm trying to walk more. I take the train to work usually but if I can walk home, that adds a bunch of steps to my day.\"— Natalie Wu, Associate Money ReporterAs you look to break habits that don't suit you, Moore reminds you to leave some room for grace, especially if you're a very disciplined person.\"There's a part of you that needs to be free, and indulgent, and impulsive, and enjoy life,\" she said.And if you're struggling to keep up with the changes you're making to your routine, \"there's nothing inherently wrong with not being ready,\" Moore added. \"You're just not ready. You don't have enough motivation, and you have too many obstacles.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attend an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Japan Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-Hoon | ReutersOpenAI and SoftBank announced plans to invest $1 billion in SB Energy as part of a strategic partnership that will support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.The partnership is part of the $500 billion Stargate commitment that OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle announced last January at the White House, according to a Friday release. As part of the agreement, SB Energy will build and operate OpenAI's 1.2 gigawatt data center site in Milam County, Texas that was announced in September. \"Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data center infrastructure and energy development and OpenAI's deep domain expertise in data center engineering,\" Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, said in a statement on Friday. \"The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimized AI data centers.\"SB Energy is backed by SoftBank and Ares Management. The company develops, owns and operates  energy projects across the U.S. It has offices in Redwood City, California, San Diego and Denver, according to its website. In addition to the investment, SB Energy has also formed a non-exclusive preferred partnership with OpenAI and SoftBank to develop \"a new model for data center builds,\" according to the release. That model will combine OpenAI's first-party data center design with SB Energy's \"proven expertise in speed, cost discipline, and integrated energy delivery,\" the companies said.The company has several multi-gigawatt data center campuses in development, and initial facilities are under construction and expected to enter service this year, the release said. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI have become increasingly intertwined over the past year. Two months after the Stargate project was announced, OpenAI said it closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.SoftBank said in November that it's sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as it looks to capitalize on its \"all in\" bet on OpenAI.The ChatGPT maker is burning through mounds of cash, and is still far from profitability, meaning it remains heavily reliant on outside capital.OpenAI has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company was on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate in 2025, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.WATCH: Judge rules Elon Musk’s lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trialwatch now",

    "body": "Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesCompany: Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)Business: Lululemon Athletica is a technical athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. The company organizes its operations into four regional markets: the Americas, China Mainland, Asia Pacific (APAC), and Europe and the Middle East (EMEA). It conducts its business through different channels in each market, including the company-operated stores, e-commerce, temporary locations, wholesale, outlets, a re-commerce program, as well as license and supply arrangements. The company offers a comprehensive line of technical athletic apparel, footwear and accessories marketed under the lululemon brand. Its apparel assortment includes items such as shorts, tops and jackets designed for a healthy lifestyle, including athletic activities such as yoga, running, training and most other activities. It also offers apparel designed for being on the move and fitness-inspired accessories. It operates stores in the United States, Canada, China Mainland, Australia, South Korea and others.Stock Market Value: $23.92B ($203.90 per share) Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLululemon Athletica shares in the past 12 monthsActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that manages approximately $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Elliott has taken a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and is bringing in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company.Behind the scenesLululemon is a global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company, offering pants, shorts, tops, and jackets for activities such as yoga, running and training. While the company remains anchored in its core North America market (~70% of revenue), it has built a significant presence in APAC (~25%), and China specifically (18%), as well as Europe (~5%). In fact, these ancillary markets have grown quite rapidly, with APAC and Europe delivering average compound annual growth rates of 33% and 22% respectively, over the past year. This international expansion has helped drive strong overall topline growth, with sales growing from $8 billion in 2023 to $11.9 billion today. However, in that same period, the company's share price has gone down from over $500 to now below $220 per share. The problem here lies in North America. Growth in this core market has slowed to low single digits, and now has turned negative, with comparable sales down 5% in the most recent quarter. Further, while the China growth story resonated with investors when North America was showing continued expansion, this narrative on its own in the face of North American core uncertainty is not something that is very appetizing to public market investors. The root challenges in the North America business can be traced back to 2018, when Calvin McDonald became Lululemon CEO. From the beginning of his tenure, and through the post-Covid period, the company operated in a golden era for athleisure, benefiting from the broad casualization of apparel and enjoying years of outsized growth as the only real large-scale player. While this environment delivered years of share price appreciation, it also masked a series of strategic missteps that would later come back to bite them. First, Lululemon used much of these earnings to pursue new business lines, including its $500 million acquisition of Mirror, as well as the launches of footwear and skincare lines, none of which have generated meaningful shareholder value. Moreover, while these initiatives may have been tolerable on their own during a period of rapid growth, they ultimately distracted management from the core North America business that was key to revenue growth. This loss of focus became especially pronounced in May 2024, when the company's chief product officer resigned. Since then, product direction and design have widely been perceived to be largely centralized under McDonald. Lululemon has shifted from its historically sleek and highly functional aesthetic toward louder branding and collaborations, such as with Disney, that are not aligned with the core customer. As a result, the company's brand perception has shifted, allowing competitors like Alo and Vuori to gain momentum and begin taking share, particular among Lululemon's core customer base of young women. This is a dynamic that is evident to anybody who shops in the category. While store traffic and brand awareness remain high, conversion has deteriorated. These product missteps have been further compounded by broader operational issues in the areas of marketing, supply chain and corporate cost controls. Together, these issues have driven margin pressure, eroded brand momentum in North America, and ultimately contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock price. On Dec. 11, 2025, Lululemon announced that McDonald would step down as CEO effective Jan. 31, 2026. This impending leadership transition is what set the stage for Elliott to disclose a more than $1 billion position in Lululemon and bring in Jane Nielsen, former CFO and COO of Ralph Lauren, as a potential CEO candidate at the company. Lululemon is still a quality product and brand that has somewhat lost its way and needs to be invigorated. It does not need a CEO who knows all the answers (if that exists) but one who will hire the best talent and institute the right processes so management can work as a team of marketers, merchandisers and product developers to come up with the solutions. At the same time by delegating these duties to competent senior executives, Nielsen will be able to also oversee the company's supply chain and corporate structure to solve the problems there and institute a cost discipline that has been absent. This is what Nielsen has experience doing at both Ralph Lauren and Coach. In 2014, when Nielsen was at Coach, the manufacturer of luxury handbags was losing out to rivals and announced that it expected same-store sales in North America to be down by a high-teens percentage in the coming year. Nielsen told investors that Coach would be back to profitability within two years. Nielsen helped Coach close underperforming stores and get inventory under control and by March 2016, the Coach brand posted its first quarterly sales increase in North America in nearly three years. When Nielsen joined Ralph Lauren in September 2016, sales had stalled and net income had fallen approximately 50% since 2014. In a 2024 article in The Wall Street Journal, Nielsen was quoted as saying, \"The brand was bigger and better than the business was showing\" — which is similar to Lululemon today. Nielsen and the leadership team targeted millennial and Gen Z shoppers and overhauled the website and closed stores, leading to an increase of 20% in adjusted operating income.When an activist comes to a company with an idea or recommendation, they are just as happy if the company takes that recommendation or comes up with a better one. Elliott is not saying that Jane Nielsen is the best person for the job. The firm is saying that she is the best person it knows of for the job, and the firm does extensive and comprehensive diligence and analysis before making a recommendation like this. Elliott cannot name the next CEO. The board does that. And while Elliott would like to see Nielsen as the next CEO, if the board decides on someone else who is equally qualified, Elliott will support that decision. In practicality, whoever the next CEO is will be pseudo-approved by Elliott because we have never seen a qualified CEO with options take a job like this if they knew an activist like Elliott opposed his or her appointment. But Elliott's presence alone adds a lot of value to the situation which the board should recognize. First, it justifies a sense of urgency, which is needed here. Second, the firm brings to the table a more than qualified CEO candidate who is ready and willing to take on this role. Third, an activist of Elliott's stature and reputation can give the board cover in whatever decision they make. This third point is particularly important when there is an outspoken founder in the wings like Chip Wilson who has been publicly criticizing board decisions. Without the activist, even a competent and experienced board could compromise on the CEO selection to appease the vocal founder. This is very similar to Elliott's recent campaign at Starbucks, another iconic brand facing popularity, competition and image challenges with an outspoken founder not afraid to give his opinion. At Starbucks, Elliott's efforts quickly culminated in the appointment of Brian Niccol as CEO, now working to reset the company's strategy and restore investor confidence. Elliott's presence justified the urgency required and its endorsement of Niccol gave the board the external credibility to act quickly.Since Elliott engaged Lululemon, on Dec. 29, Chip Wilson has nominated three directors – Marc Maurer, the former co-CEO of On Holding AG; Laura Gentile, former chief marketing officer of ESPN; and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision, the largest segment of Activision Blizzard – for election to the board at the 2026 annual meeting.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

    "body": "An Amazon warehouse in Warrington, England.Nathan Stirk | Getty ImagesAmazon has submitted plans for a large-format store near Chicago that would be larger than a Walmart Supercenter, marking the latest experiment with physical retail for the tech company.As part of the plans, Amazon has proposed building a one-story, 229,000-square-foot building in Orland Park, Illinois, that would offer a range of products, such as groceries, household essentials and general merchandise, the city said on Saturday. By comparison, Walmart's U.S. Supercenters typically average 179,000 square feet.The Amazon facility would also include a \"limited warehouse component\" to support on-site operations and space for delivery drivers to pick up orders, according to planning documents.\"We regularly test new experiences designed to make customers' lives better and easier every day, including physical stores,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about.\"The e-commerce company has been determined to have a bigger presence in brick-and-mortar retail after stealing market share from incumbents. Amazon acquired upscale grocer Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion in 2017, the largest deal in its history.Amazon also launched bookstores, shopping mall kiosks, apparel stores, convenience marts and its own supermarket chain. It's since scrapped many of those concepts or slowed the rollout of new locations. The Orland Park Plan Commission approved Amazon's proposal on Tuesday, and it will now proceed to a vote from the full village board. That meeting is scheduled for Jan. 19. The proposed facility would replace a local restaurant, Petey's II, which closed in January 2024. The site sits at the corner of two major highways running through Orland Park, and would be down the street from a Target, Costco and Trader Joe's, among other major national chains. Some residents have pushed back on Amazon's planned development, expressing concerns over how it could impact traffic in the surrounding area, NBC 5 Chicago reported.WATCH: How AI could upend shoppingwatch now",

    "body": "Are we in an artificial intelligence bubble?It's the debate that dominated the tech industry in 2025, and it's not going away anytime soon.Record valuations and deals driven by major investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI boom, leaving some to brace for the potential burst.AI leaders like OpenAI and Nvidia have spun an impressive web of staggering deals with cloud infrastructure companies, while hyperscalers including Amazon, Microsoft and Google continue to spend billions on data center buildouts.Although companies are racing to supply the rapidly accelerating AI demand, the enormous debt financing these buildouts have sparked worry that the spending spree may prove to be an overreach.Economic bubbles occur when asset prices in a specific market rapidly rise, often due to speculation or overenthusiasm, followed by a crash when prices suddenly drop.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotsBubble talks ignited again at the end of last year after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of a possible AI bust during the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" he said. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Others have been less confident in the stability of the AI surge, including \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry. The fund manager, who rose to fame for predicting the 2008 housing crisis, drew parallels between the current spending euphoria and the dot-com mania of the late 1990s in a lengthy Substack essay.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles,\" Burry wrote in an October X post. \"Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a similar comparison during a dinner with reporters in August.\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.A note on methodology:CNBC compiled responses from 40 tech executives, analysts and other professionals in the space, who shared their thoughts over the past four months about the current AI frenzy.Although the question of whether or not the market is in a bubble seems binary, many answers have landed across a spectrum of bubble potential — and worry.To give each response a more rounded perspective, CNBC also weighed the level of concern.CNBC scored each person's remarks on a scale from 0 to 10 on two factors: How much they believe that AI is in a bubble (0 being no and 10 being yes) and how concerned they are about it (0 being not concerned at all and 10 being very concerned).",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump in a social media post Thursday evening indirectly revealed data from Friday's market-moving nonfarm payrolls count, an apparent violation of long-standing federal policy on statistical releases.In a Truth Social post around 9 p.m. ET, the president indicated that private sector payrolls had expanded by 654,000 for the full year of 2025, a total that would have included Friday's jobs count for December. Office of Management and Budget policy prohibits executive branch officials from commenting on such releases early and in fact forbids public statements until 30 minutes after the release. Presidents can be briefed on official jobs figures ahead of the release.A White House official conceded, however, that \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information. The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.\"The official further chided the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy\" and instead urged a focus on how \"President Trump's policies are laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.\"The Trump post drew a distinction between private and government job growth, with the latter down 181,000 for 2025.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' December jobs report, posted by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social account, about 12 hours before the figures were publicly released, is seen in this screenshot obtained on January 9, 2026. @realdonaldtrump | Via ReutersFriday's jobs data release went on to show that nonfarm payrolls increased 50,000 for December, all but 2,000 of which came from the private sector. The figures, while slightly less than official economists' estimates, assuaged concerns about a steeper drop in employment. Stock futures trended higher following the data.While Trump's post would not allow traders to calculate the exact payrolls figure because of lack of data on revisions, they could have gleaned a rough estimation of the figure and possibly ruled out a December job-loss scenario that would have spooked markets.Trump once telegraphed somewhat a positive jobs figure in his first term, drawing criticism.",

Conrades, 86, has been on the board for 18 years. Seligman, 87, joined the board in 2005.\"Neither retirement was the result of any dispute or disagreement with Oracle on any matter relating to Oracle's operations, policies or practices,\" the company said. Its board now consists of 12 directors. The software maker and cloud infrastructure provider has been under new management since September, when the company abruptly announced that it was replacing CEO Safra Catz, 64, with two executives, Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia. Magouyrk and Sicilia have been working to rapidly open data centers full of Nvidia graphics processing units that can run generative artificial intelligence models on behalf of clients such as OpenAI and xAI. Oracle shares surged in September after the company revealed a 359% jump in remaining performance obligation, suggesting that faster year-over-year revenue growth will follow. But the stock plummeted in the fourth quarter, more than erasing those earlier gains, as Wall Street became more skeptical of the company's ability to repay debts while delivering on AI. Larry Ellison, Oracle's 81-year-old co-founder and chief technology officer, remains on the company's board and continues to serve as executive chairman.

    "body": "watch nowLeading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,\" Woods told Trump at the White House. \"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable.\" Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\"As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,\" Lance told the president. Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. \"We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,\" Nelson told Trump. \"We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. \"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\"",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court did not rule Friday on the legality of broad tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leaving markets still awaiting a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on trade policy and the U.S. fiscal situation.There had been speculation that the tariff ruling would be issued on Friday, but the Supreme Court released just one opinion for the day, and it was unrelated to tariffs.It is unclear when the tariff ruling will be released. The court will release its next rulings Wednesday.When it does come, the decision will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "watch nowNew video that appears to show Renee Nicole Good in her car right before she was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis was posted Friday on social media by the site Alpha News.The 47-second-long video appears to have been taken by a phone held by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fired at the 37-year-old Good on Wednesday as she drove her SUV toward him on a residential street.The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familar with the investigation told MS Now.\"Ohhhh!\" the agent apparently moans, as the Honda Pilot lurches by him.\"F---ing bitch,\" the agent apparently mutters after firing at Good.Video still shows Renee Good moments before an ICE agent opened fire and killed her.Source: Alpha NewsVice President JD Vance reposted the video on his X account.\"Watch this, as hard as it is,\" Vance wrote. \"Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.\"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and other Democrats have strongly disputed the claim by officials in the Trump administration that Good was trying to intentionally hit the ICE agent. Some observers have said Good, a mother of three, was trying to swerve around him after being approached by other ICE agents, who were directing her to get out of the SUV.Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, whose department oversees ICE, said in a statement Friday, \"This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement.\"\"The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense. The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,\" McLaughlin said.The new video begins with the ICE agent exiting his car and walking over to Good's SUV, which is behind his, and blocking the road, as sirens blare in the background.The agent then walks over to the driver's door, where the video clearly shows Good's face through the open window.\"That's fine, dude, I'm not mad,\" Good tells him on the video. \"I'm not mad at any of you.\"There is a dog in the back of the SUV.Another woman, who was standing next to Good's car, says to the agent, \"Show your face, big boy, show your face.\"As the agent moves to the rear of Good's SUV to take video of its license plate, the other woman says, \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning.\"\"Just so you know. It'll be the same plate when you come talk to us later,\" the woman says, holding up her own phone with its camera lenses pointed at the agent. \"That's fine. U.S. citizen, former f---ing veteran, disabled veteran, you want to come at us? You want to come at us?\" the woman says. \"I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead,\" she says.At that point, another ICE agent approaches the driver's side of Good's SUV, saying, \"Out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the f---ing car. Get out of the car.\"The second woman walks over to Good's car as if to get into the front passenger seat, the video reveals.\"Drive baby, drive!\" the woman says to Good as she grabs the door handle.But the SUV backs up slightly and then moves forward.The agent fires within a second or two of that movement toward him.This is breaking news.

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 5, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year.Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida.But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence.\"This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"A senior White House official said the defectors represent just a \"tiny fraction\" of congressional Republicans.\"Republicans aren't always going to have the same views as the president,\" the White House official said.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseStill, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts.On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat.The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces.Many of those who supported the bill to extend the tax credits were among the most vulnerable Republicans in the 2026 midterms.\"I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report.Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that \"Republicans should be ashamed\" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they \"should never be elected to office again.\"Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, \"Why would I?\"The White House, however, said there is a \"significant\" chance future votes on the resolution might go the president's way.\"A number of these members have left the door open to additional conversations,\" the senior official said.Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland \"amateurish\" and \"stupid.\" The White House official called those remarks \"disappointing.\"A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"All I'm saying is, you need to show respect to a committee of jurisdiction,\" Tillis told reporters this week.And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. The monument was supposed to be displayed on the West front of the Capitol by March 2023, but had been blocked by House Republicans.Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. On the five-year anniversary this week, the White House launched a web page casting blame on Democrats, then-Vice President Mike Pence, and Capitol Police for the violence that transpired that day.Officers \"risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended,\" Tillis said in a statement. When asked about the plaque, the White House official said, \"The administration doesn't have a position on the decorations of the Capitol.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday his administration will take action on Greenland \"whether they like it or not,\" further escalating his rhetoric as he pushes to acquire the Danish territory for the U.S.\"I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.The comments came during a meeting with oil executives to discuss the prospect of doing business in Venezuela. Less than a week earlier, the U.S. military invaded the oil-rich South American nation and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro.Trump has long sought to take over Greenland, primarily citing the Arctic island's importance for U.S. national security. Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have pushed back, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. But the Trump administration nevertheless says it is currently weighing a range of options on Greenland, including utilizing the U.S. military or cutting a deal to purchase it from Denmark.Government officials have also mulled sending lump sums of cash to Greenlanders in order to sway them to join the U.S., Reuters reported Thursday.Asked on Friday how much those payments could be, Trump said, \"I'm not talking about money for Greenland, yet.\"\"I might talk about that, but right now we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" Trump said.\"Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\" he said.Trump said that while he is a \"big fan\" of Denmark, \"the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. [I'm] sure we had lots of boats go there also.\"\"So we're going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult,\" he said.The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, and it reportedly has the ability to expand its presence there if desired.But that isn't enough, Trump said.\"When we own it, we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way, you have to own it,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates fell sharply on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump said on social media that he is instructing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds. \"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he said in the Truth Social post.The rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 5.99%, matching the low from Feb. 2, 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily. Fannie Mae and Freddie, which are in government conservatorship, do not originate home loans. They buy loans from lenders, bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, and sell them to investors — thereby replenishing lender funds for new loans and keeping interest rates lower and more stable for homebuyers.Purchasing more mortgage-backed bonds or securities does move mortgage rates lower. In the first two months of the Covid pandemic, as markets reeled, the Federal Reserve purchased $580 billion in agency MBS. It then continued buying more throughout the year. From March 2020 through June 2021, the Federal Reserve increased its agency MBS holdings from $1.4 trillion to $2.3 trillion, according to the Dallas Fed. The Federal Reserve also lowered its own lending rate to zero. The combination brought the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage to record lows, hitting just 2.75% at the start of 2021, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"How big a deal is $200 billion? This depends on a few factors, but the reaction in the MBS market is enough to tell you that it matters,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily which tracks rates closely and is already seeing them fall just from the news of the announcement.While it is still not known how quickly this would start and how long it will take, analysts are predicting where mortgage rates could end up; most put the drop somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points, some even lower. \"We believe that $200bn of MBS purchases could drive a ~10-25bps reduction in mortgage rates, potentially reducing the current 30-year headline mortgage rate to roughly 6.0% (current 6.21%). While still elevated relative to the average outstanding mortgage rate of 4.4% and the 3.25% levels as recently as Jan 2022, this decline may provide a boost to both new construction demand and existing home turnover,\" analysts at UBS wrote.Put simply, if rates were to drop even to 5.9%, for someone buying the median-priced home — which is right around $425,000, according to the National Association of Realtors — using a 30-year fixed mortgage with a 20% down payment, the monthly payment would drop by $118. For some, that may not seem like a lot, but for first-time buyers on the edge of affordability, it could make a difference. They would still, however, need to save for the down payment, which is currently the biggest hurdle for most first-timers. Homebuilder stocks rallied on the news, but they were already buying down mortgage rates prior to this well into the 5% range. Their concerns lately have been more focused on increasing costs from tariffs and a continued labor shortage. That said, just the news of this could have an impact on buyer demand for the builders. \"I think psychologically it will help,\" said Ivy Zelman, executive vice president of research and securities at Zelman, a Walker & Dunlop company. \"I think that today, people that have been looking that didn't even know builders were offering mortgage rate buydowns might step into the market.\"But Zelman also points out that in the broader home market it's not just the mortgage rate, but overall affordability that is keeping buyers sidelined. Consumers are stretched, and home prices are close to 50% higher than they were pre-pandemic, ironically because of those record-low mortgage rates brought on by MBS purchases.\"This is not enough to really get the market going because we know people can't qualify even at 4.99%. They can say that the mortgage rates are going to go down to below 5, but we have people that still can't qualify at 4.99%, so I think there's more work to be done,\" Zelman said.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.This could also help builder margins, which have been shrinking lately because of higher costs.\"From a demand perspective, [it is] maybe a marginal benefit from the positive psychological impact on consumers,\" said John Lovallo, analyst at UBS. \"Bigger is the potential ability for builders to begin pulling back on incentives to some extent which would be very accretive to gross margins.\"The drop, however, could also help current homeowners to save on their monthly payments through a refinance. Rates have already been dropping steadily, with the 30-year fixed down from it's recent peak of 7.16% one year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan were already 133% higher year over year before this announcement, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The general rule of thumb is that a refinance is only worth the cost if you can save more than 75 basis points on a mortgage rate. This would add many more potential candidates to the refinance pool, especially those who took out their loans over the last two years. The vast majority of homeowners, however, still have rates below 4%. ",

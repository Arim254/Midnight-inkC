    "body": "If you don't have children and don't plan on having any, many of the \"default\" settings of personal finance may not apply to you. You may not, for instance, plan on leaving legacy wealth, as many parents do, and you certainly don't have to worry about paying for a kid's wedding or college education.But who will take care of you or make decisions on your behalf in the event that you can't make them for yourself? For many Americans, the default answer is, \"my kids.\"If something bad happens and you don't have children who will take care of you, things can get complicated quickly, says Maddy Roche, chief growth officer at Childfree Trust, a fiduciary firm specializing in childfree and permanently childless people.\"Think about some of the structures that assume that you have children, whether it be insurance planning, estate planning, medical relationships,\" she says. \"You can't get an elective surgery unless you have an emergency contact. Those are the things that we run up against when time's too late.\"The solution, she says, is to start thinking about these scenarios early. \"As hard as it is to think about the future, one of the best ways to ensure that you'll be respected in the ways that you crave and deserve is to be proactive,\" she says.Be proactive in your planningJust about every financial professional will tell you that everyone — whether you have kids or not — needs some form of an estate plan, which expresses how you'd like medical and financial decisions to be carried out in the event of your death or incapacitation.This becomes even more important for people whose family strays from the norm, Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner specializing in childfree clients, previously told CNBC Make It.Because health care and government systems look for next-of-kin, there may be no one obvious to contact in the event you get into an accident while out of town, for instance, he says: \"That means the government or health-care system will be making decisions for you.\"To avoid those scenarios, you'll need documents in place, such as powers of attorney and a health-care directive. These documents go by different names in different states, so talk with an attorney about your specific needs, but the gist is that they lay out your wishes and designate a decision-maker for you should you become incapacitated.These wishes could be as consequential as whether or not you want to be on a respirator or as straightforward as what to do with your cats while you're in the hospital.Designate a trusted friend or relativeFor many childfree people, figuring out who will execute your plan comes with some complications. You may, for instance, want to nominate an extended family member to oversee your care — but that could create conflicts of interest if that person stands to inherit your estate.\"Some people feel like they need to offer monetary compensation for these roles. Say, for instance, you have a long-lost nephew,\" she says. \"Are we sure he won't feel conflicted in terms of helping you manage your affairs — that you'll stay in the kind of quality facility you need if he feels his inheritance is on the line?\"In some states, you may be able to hire a fiduciary to execute your estate — someone who is bound by law to act in your best financial interest. For the most part, though, you'll have to cultivate what Roche calls a \"strategic relationship\" with a trusted friend or relative.The key, she says, is to make sure you're on the same page as early as possible.\"You need to start to think about your wishes and make sure they're documented and make sure the people you're nominating really know what you want to happen,\" Roche says. \"Talk with people about what these roles are and what you expect of them.

    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2022.Benoit Tessier | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said he knows nothing about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao — or that company's recent involvement in a cryptocurrency venture linked to Trump's family — despite granting him a pardon last month.Asked in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday why he pardoned the former crypto executive known as CZ, Trump said: \"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is.\"In late 2023, Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance and pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to sufficiently combat money laundering on his crypto exchange. He was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.Trump suggested that his decision to pardon CZ was motivated by a desire to make the U.S. more globally competitive in the nascent crypto industry. And he accused the government under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, of waging a \"witch hunt\" against CZ, even as Trump repeatedly denied knowledge of his case.\"My sons are involved in crypto much more than I— me. I— I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry,\" he said. \"And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is.\"Despite saying he didn't know who CZ is, Trump said Zhao \"was treated really badly by the Biden administration.\"\"They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it,\" the president said.\"I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him,\" Trump went on. \"I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\"Trump's claim that he knows nothing about a high-profile clemency recipient comes as he and Republicans have asserted that pardons issued by Biden using an \"autopen\" are invalid because, they contend, the president was not aware of what he was signing.Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in March that many of Biden's pardons are void \"because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\"After Republicans on the Oversight Committee issued a report last month on Biden's autopen use, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the former president \"didn't even know what the categories were, apparently, much less the individual people, that he pardoned.\"Binance in 2023 agreed to pay a total of $4.3 billion to settle a multiyear investigation into allegations that the platform's users had made thousands of transactions in support of illicit activities, including terrorism and child abuse.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called that fine \"one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.\"Following Trump's election, Zhao mounted an aggressive campaign for clemency, including publicly praising the president and submitting pardon applications, The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysBinance also recently became financially entangled with World Liberty Financial, a crypto finance platform that sends 75% of token sales revenue to a company linked to Trump and his family.In May, World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff — a son of top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff — said his company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.Later that same month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it would drop its case against Binance and Zhao.The president announced Zhao's pardon on Oct. 23.Trump was asked in Sunday's CBS interview to address \"the appearance of pay for play.\"\"Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy,\" Trump said before a moment of crosstalk.\"I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government,\" he said.Returning to CZ, Trump said: \"I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government.\"",

    "body": "Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminalAhmed Jadallah | ReutersSaudi Aramco on Tuesday posted a 0.9% jump in third-quarter profit, beating expectations on the back of higher production even as oil prices remained under pressure.The world's largest oil company reported adjusted net income of 104.92 billion Saudi riyals ($27.98 billion) for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of 98.47 billion Saudi riyals, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.The results come as Aramco faces a profit squeeze amid weaker oil prices — down over 6% this year until September — except for a short-lived surge in the second quarter triggered by tensions between Israel and Iran.Year-to-date, spot prices of the U.S. West Texas Intermediate are down over 16%, data from FactSet showed. Similarly, the global benchmark Brent is down over 12%.\"We increased production with minimal incremental cost, and reliably supplied the oil, gas and associated products our customers depend on, driving strong financial performance and quarterly earnings growth,\" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said.Some other third-quarter highlights included:Third-quarter revenue came in at 418.16 billion Saudi riyals, beating analyst estimates of 411.26 billion Saudi riyals.Net debt stood at 114.33 billion Saudi riyals in the third quarter, down from 115.59 billion Saudi riyals three months earlier.Aramco reported a free cash flow of $23.6 billion compared with $22 billion a year earlier. The board also declared the 2025 base dividend of $21.1 billion and performance-linked dividend of $0.2 billion to be paid in the fourth quarter.Over the weekend, OPEC+ announced a modest increase in oil production for December and decided to halt further hikes during the first quarter of next year. The cartel members agreed to raise their December production target by 137,000 barrels per day, matching the hike for October and November.Since April, OPEC+ has raised its output targets by approximately 2.9 million barrels per day but began easing the pace of these increases in October over expectations of a market glut.Adding to the complexity, new Western sanctions on Russia, a key OPEC+ member, are posing difficulties for the group's production strategy, as Moscow faces limits in boosting output after the U.S. imposed additional restrictions on the country's major oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.Aramco recently completed its acquisition of a 22.5% stake in Petro Rabigh, Reuters reported, from Japan's Sumitomo Chemical for $701.8 million, bringing the Saudi company's total ownership to roughly 60%.The oil giant also recently acquired a minority stake in artificial intelligence company HUMAIN, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Nasser added that the company's stake in HUMAIN is expected to further drive innovation and progress its role in the \"crucial and rapidly evolving AI sector.\"",

    "body": "HONG KONG, CHINA - 2025/03/01: In this photo illustration, Artificial intelligence (AI) apps of perplexity, DeepSeek and ChatGPT are seen on a smartphone screen.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAs companies pour billions into artificial intelligence, HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery on Tuesday warned of a mismatch between investments and revenues.Speaking at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong, Elhedery said the scale of investment poses a conundrum for companies: while the computing power for AI is essential, current revenue profiles may not justify such massive spending.Morgan Stanley in July estimated that over the next five years, global data center capacity would grow six times, with data centers and their hardware alone costing $3 trillion by the end of 2028.McKinsey said in a report in April that by 2030, data centers equipped to handle AI processing loads would require $5.2 trillion in capital expenditure to keep up with compute demand, while the capex for those powering traditional IT applications is forecast at $1.5 trillion.Elhedery said that consumers were not ready to pay for it, and businesses will be cautious as productivity benefits will not materialize in a year or two.\"These are like five year trends, and therefore the ramp up means that we will start seeing real revenue benefits and real readiness to pay for it, probably later than than the expectations of investors,\" he said.William Ford, chairman and CEO of General Atlantic, speaking at the same panel, agreed: \"In the long term, you're going to create a whole new set of industries and applications, and there will be a productivity payoff, but that's a 10-, 20-year play.\"Big Tech firms Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon have all lifted their guidance for capital expenditures and now collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.OpenAI, which set off the AI frenzy with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, has announced roughly $1 trillion worth of infrastructure deals with partners including Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.Ford said that the huge expenditure that is going into the sector shows that people recognize the long-term impact of AI. This sector, however, will be capital-intensive initially, and \"you need to, sort of, pay up front for the opportunity that's going to come down the road,\" he said.Ford warned there could be \"misallocation of capital, destruction, overvaluation... [and] irrational exuberance\" in the initial stages, and also added that it can be difficult to pick winners and losers at the moment.\"You're really betting on this being a broad based technology, more like railroads or electricity, that had profound impacts over over time, and reshaped the economy, but were very hard to predict exactly how in the first few years.\"",

Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesNintendo raised its forecast for sales of the Switch 2 console in its current fiscal year as momentum for its new flagship console grows.The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 19 million units of the Switch in the fiscal year ending March 2026 versus a previous forecast of 15 million units.Here's how Nintendo did in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 versus LSEG estimates:Revenue: 527.2 billion Japanese yen ($3.7 billion) versus 461.76 billion yen expected.Net profit: 102.9 billion Japanese yen versus 63.6 billion yen expected.Revenue was up over 90% year-on-year while profit rose more than 270%.Nintendo is riding a wave of momentum after launching its latest console called the Switch 2 in June, with the stock up nearly 40% this year.Nintendo said it sold 4.54 million units of the Switch 2 in the September quarter. That was a decline compared to the \"high demand seen immediately following the launch of Nintendo Switch 2\" during its fiscal first quarter, Nintendo said, adding that \"performance remained strong.\"In total, Nintendo has sold 10.36 million units of the Switch 2 since launch.\"Mario Kart World\" and \"Donkey Kong Bonanza\" have proved to be two of Nintendo's most popular games since the Switch 2 launch, helping the company record 11.95 million units of software sold for the console in the quarter.Nintendo's optimism around the Switch 2 prompted the company to also raise other financial forecasts. The Kyoto-headquartered firm said it now sees net sales at 2.25 trillion yen for its fiscal year versus a previous forecast of 1.9 trillion yen. It also hiked its net profit outlook by nearly 17% to 350 billion yen.New games in focusNintendo's original Switch, first released in 2017, has become its second-best selling console of all time after the Nintendo DS. The hybrid nature – where people could play the console at home and on the go – has caught on.There were questions swirling over whether Nintendo's Switch 2 would be different enough from its predecessor to entice users. So far, initial Switch 2 sales appear to be strong for Nintendo. Investors will now assess the current quarter and demand during the critical holiday season.Nintendo managed to maintain sales for the original Switch over several years thanks to games based around key franchises like Super Mario and Pokemon, a playbook it is looking to replicate with the Switch 2.Last month, Nintendo released \"Pokémon Legends: Z-A\" as well as an offer that bundles the game with the Switch 2 console. \"Kirby Air Riders\" and \"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond\" are also scheduled for this year.\"We will aim to keep the momentum of released titles and continuously introduce new titles to expand the platform's user base,\" Nintendo said in its earnings release.",

    "body": "A small replica of the Charging Bull statue is seen on a street vendor stall outside the New York Stock Exchange on July 11, 2025.Jeenah Moon | ReutersGlobal markets may be due for a reality check after this year's relentless rally, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday cautioned investors to brace for a drawdown over the next two years.Equities worldwide have been soaring, hitting record highs this year, driven by AI-linked gains and expectations of rate cuts. Over the past month, key U.S. indexes have scaled new peaks, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit fresh highs, while China's Shanghai Composite has notched its strongest level in a decade on easing U.S-China tensions and a softer dollar. \"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. \"Things run, and then they pull back so people can reassess.\"However, Solomon noted that such reversals were a normal feature of long-term bull markets, noting that the investment bank's standing advice to clients remains to stay invested and review portfolio allocation, not attempt to time markets.\"A 10 to 15% drawdown happens often, even through positive market cycles,\" he said. \"It's not something that changes your fundamental, your structural belief as to how you want to allocate capital.\"Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, speaking at the same panel, said investors should welcome periodic pullbacks, calling them healthy developments rather than signs of crisis.\"We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,\" he said.Solomon and Pick's views come on the back of recent warnings by the IMF of a possible sharp correction, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have also cautioned about inflated stock valuations.Bright spots in AsiaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pointed to Asia as a bright spot in the next few years on the back of recent developments including the trade pact between the U.S. and China. Goldman expects global capital allocators to continue to be interested in China, adding that it remains one of the \"largest and most important economies\" in the world.Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Hong Kong, China, Japan and India due to their unique growth stories. Japan's corporate-governance reforms and India's infrastructure build-out were singled out as multi-year investment themes.\"It's hard not to be excited about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India — three vastly different narratives, but all part of a global Asia story,\" Ted said. He highlighted the AI, EV and biotech sectors in China particularly.",

    "body": "Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Lisa Cook speaks on \"The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\" at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 3, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in her first policy speech since President Donald Trump tried to remove her from office, said Monday that she supported the recent interest rate reduction and indicated she would be open to more.Since Trump made his move in August to sack Cook on accusations of mortgage fraud, she has kept a relatively low profile outside of the court battles that have kept her in her position at the central bank.In remarks before the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., the policymaker laid out her views on the economy and where she thinks monetary policy should land. Generally, she sees the economy as solid with risks to both the Fed's goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.Cook said she sided with the 10-2 vote on the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the second meeting in a row that saw a cut.\"I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization,\" she said.Trump has been blocked by courts from removing Cook in what has been seen as a pivotal issue for central bank independence. Though White House officials have said Cook lied in forms she filled out for federally guaranteed home mortgages, she has not been convicted of anything nor have any charges even been brought. Cook has cited \"clerical errors\" in the loan applications. She declined to comment on the matter during a question-and-answer session, saying \"it would be inappropriate\" while noting she is \"beyond grateful\" for the support she has received.In the meantime, she has continued her duties at the Fed, which lowered its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December.As for the path going forward, Cook said she is sticking with a data-dependent position. FOMC officials in September indicated an additional cut is likely before the end of the year.\"As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks,\" she said. \"Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\"\"Certainly we want to see if tariff effects are persistent, to see if firms are waiting to raise prices, to see what they've done with inventory,\" she added. \"So there's a lot to look at. There's a lot to anticipate with the December meeting coming up.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets during his Wednesday post-meeting news conference when he said the December cut is not a sure thing. Powell noted a wide dispersion of opinions on the committee, known more often for its consensus approach to policy.\"Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,\" Cook said, using what has become boilerplate language for Fed officials. \"We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated.\"On inflation, she said Trump's tariffs have not fully made their way through the economy. However, she said the most likely outcome is a \"one-time increase\" in prices not likely to fuel inflation over the longer term.",

    "body": "Ford Mustang Mach-E EV vehicles at a Ford dealership in Los Angeles, California, US, on Thursday, Oct 16, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Sales of all-electric vehicles collapsed last month following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for purchasing an EV, several automakers said Monday.Ford Motor, Kia, Hyundai Motor and Toyota Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% decline for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.Toyota reported it sold 18 units of its sole all-electric vehicle, named the BZ, in October. That was down from 1,401 units a year earlier and 61 vehicles the month before.Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month to month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, fell by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for comparable vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.\"While the expiration of the federal tax credit impacted EV sales in the month of October, we still saw strong demand leading up to that change, and we remain confident that the market is going to reset,\" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during a Monday interview.Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.Parker said Hyundai's hybrid sales surged 41% last month compared with October 2024, leading its total \"electrified\" vehicle sales, which include EVs, to be up 8%. Pure EV sales, the company said, were down 57% last month compared to October 2024, after a 157% year-over-year increase in September.Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.\"With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. \"October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.\"Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop-off in EV sales.Farley late last month said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if sales of EVs fell to a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.Tesla, at a 43.1% market share, and General Motors, at 13.8%, led the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles through the third quarter, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates EV sales volume in the U.S. hit an all-time high in the third quarter, reaching 438,487 units sold. That marked a 40.7% jump from the previous quarter and an increase of 29.6% year over year.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the description of remarks from Farley.",

Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesDe-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S. after their leaders met in South Korea last Thursday stands in stark contrast to the chill in Washington-New Delhi relations, with India now subject to higher U.S. tariffs than Beijing.Experts said that the strategic relationship between India and U.S. built over two decades has substantially eroded.Atman Trivedi a partner and lead of the South Asia Practice at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group said trust between the two countries \"could take years rebuild.\"Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"President Trump evidently does not value India as a partner in balancing China as much as the previous presidents,\" said Raymond Vickery Jr., senior associate and chair on India and emerging Asia Economics at Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. foreign policy from President Bill Clinton until recently, including Trump's first term as the president, had consistently valued \"democratic India over autocratic China,\" he said, adding that the approach toward India has now shifted from one of strategic altruism to \"transactionalism.\"Meanwhile, ties between the U.S. and China appear to be on the mend.In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said \"My G2 meeting President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries\" adding that it would lead to \"everlasting peace and success.\"  Shortly after, Pete Hegseth, U.S. secretary of defense, said on X that China and the U.S. had agreed to set up \"miliary-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate\" any problems.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday which saw Washington cutting tariffs on Beijing related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%.China now pays a lower tariff than India.In August the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India including secondary duties of 25% for its purchase of Russian oil. India has called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,\" while has called U.S. trade ties with India \"a totally one-sided disaster!\"U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images\"At the leader-level, the chemistry is missing for now, and the impact of this disconnect on the U.S.-India relationship probably cannot be overstated,\" Trivedi added.During his Asia trip last week, while addressing corporate leaders at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, Trump said he threatened India and Pakistan with 250% tariffs unless they stopped hostilities.An attack by militants in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir in April killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan and launched a military strike, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two countries.\"The strategic relationship between India and the U.S. has been under strain this year not just because of tariffs, but also because of Washington's posture in the conflict with Pakistan and the apparent warming of [U.S.] ties with Pakistan's military,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research at Oxford Economics.Trump's claims are being picked up by Modi's political opponents including the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Modi is \"scared\" of U.S. President Donald Trump, Gandhi reportedly said on Sunday in a political rally in Bihar.Hermann added that now the challenge for India would be to find its position between two economic superpowers.\"While New Delhi stands to benefit from greater access to U.S. demand, its dependence on China is unlikely to diminish in the near term given the still-extreme uncertainty around trade policy and the costs of relocating supply chains,\" she said.Keeping aside strained trade ties, U.S. and India on Friday signed a 10-year \"Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership.\"Hegseth said on X that the two countries were improving \"coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation,\" while his Indian counter Rajnath Singh said the partnership between U.S. and India was \"critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.\"Experts warn if U.S. sticks with its transactional approach toward India, it will drive the two further apart, compromising strategic interests of both.\"The Trump policy will push India further toward Russia, the Global South, and even China. This will not be in the interests of either India or the US,\" said Vickery Jr. from CSIS.",

    "body": "A Pfizer logo is displayed at a research facility in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, U.S., Sept. 30, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersPfizer on Monday said it filed a second lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera, alleging that the Danish drugmaker's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire the obesity biotech is anticompetitive. Pfizer alleges that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk's proposed acquisition of Metsera would help it maintain its dominant position in the blockbuster obesity market by eliminating a smaller potential competitor, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in Delaware. The suit also alleges that Metsera's controlling shareholders conspired with the obesity biotech and Novo Nordisk. In a statement on Monday, Ambre James Brown, Novo Nordisk's vice president of global media, said \"Pfizer's baseless claims that Novo Nordisk intends to suppress innovation through our offer is false and without merit.\" \"Instead of competing on price, Pfizer has taken the highly unusual and seemingly desperate approach in filing its antitrust lawsuit today,\" Brown said. She added that Novo Nordisk's offer, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the \"best interest\" of patients and Metsera shareholders. In a statement, Metsera said, \"Pfizer is trying to litigate its way to buying Metsera for a lower price than Novo Nordisk.\" The company added that Pfizer's litigation arguments \"are nonsense, and Metsera will address them in court.\"The new suit escalates a heated standoff between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over Metsera, whose obesity pipeline could yield new competitors in the booming weight loss drug market. Pfizer in September said that it would acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, or up to $7.3 billion with future payments – a deal that could be the company's golden ticket to enter the space after struggling to bring its own obesity products to market. But Novo Nordisk on Thursday launched a takeover bid valuing the biotech at around $6 billion, triggering a deadline of four business days for Pfizer to renegotiate its offer. On Friday, Pfizer filed its first lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera seeking to block the biotech from terminating its existing merger deal with Pfizer. That suit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleges that Novo Nordisk's offer can't qualify as a superior proposal because it's not reasonably likely to be completed due to its significant regulatory risk.Novo Nordisk helped establish the weight loss drug space, bringing to market highly effective GLP-1 drugs, including the diabetes injection Ozempic and obesity shot Wegovy. But the company has lost its leading position in the market to its chief rival, Eli Lilly, over the last year and has struggled to impress investors with its pipeline. ",

    "body": "The BP logo is displayed on a petrol tanker delivering fuel at a petrol station in Shepton Mallet on October 20, 2025 in Somerset, England.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil giant BP on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit as higher crude and gas production outweighed a weak oil trading result.The London-listed oil and gas major posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.21 billion for July-September period. That beat analyst expectations of $2.03 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.BP's third-quarter net profit came in at $2.3 billion last year and $2.35 billion in the second quarter of 2025.\"We've delivered another quarter of good performance across the business with operations continuing to run well,\" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.\"We are looking to accelerate delivery of our plans, including undertaking a thorough review of our portfolio to drive simplification and targeting further improvements in cost performance and efficiency,\" Auchincloss said.The oil major's third-quarter net debt came in at $26.05 billion, broadly flat from the previous quarter, although up from $24.27 billion a year earlier.Some other third-quarter highlights included:Operating cash flow came in at $7.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion three months ago.BP said it expects divestment and other proceeds to be above $4 billion in 2025.BP also announced another $750 million in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns, albeit at a reduced level from earlier in the year.The results come just over eight months after the company launched a fundamental strategic reset.BP, which has been the subject of intense takeover speculation, is looking to regain investor confidence by slashing renewable spending and prioritizing its traditional oil and gas business.Investors appear to have broadly welcomed the oil and gas major's green strategy U-turn, with share prices up more than 13% year-to-date. The improving sentiment has also been attributed to the firm's leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program and a string of recent oil discoveries.BP on Monday announced it had agreed to sell minority stakes in some of its U.S. onshore pipeline assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to private investor Sixth Street for $1.5 billion. BP has previously said it is targeting $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027.Last week, British rival Shell reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway may have quietly trimmed its massive Apple stake again in the third quarter, a new regulatory filing suggests.In its latest quarterly report, Berkshire said the cost basis of its consumer products equity holdings fell by roughly $1.2 billion from the prior quarter. That category is dominated by the giant conglomerate's Apple position, implying the decline likely reflects additional sales of Apple shares.Apple's stock jumped more than 24% in the third quarter, a rally that would have offered Buffett an attractive opportunity to take profits.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconApple year to dateBuffett went on a head-turning selling spree in Apple in 2024, slashing two-thirds of the shares Berkshire held in a surprising move for the famously long-term-focused investor. Berkshire also trimmed its Apple stake in the second quarter of this year. The iPhone maker was still Berkshire's largest holding at the end of June, when it controlled 280 million shares worth $57 billion.Investors will get more clarity about the exact size of Berkshire's Apple position when it releases its detailed 13F filing it makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month. That will disclose any changes to individual stock holdings through Sept. 30.Buffett had previously hinted that selling down the Apple stake was for tax reasons, but others speculated that the size of the sales suggested the so-called Oracle of Omaha was also concerned about Apple's high valuation. Some thought it was also part of portfolio management, as the Apple stake had grown so big that at one time it accounted for more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio.Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters, raising more than $6 billion in cash in the third quarter. Buffett's one-time favorite yardstick for stock market valuations, which measures the total value of all publicly traded U.S. stocks against the entire gross national product of the United States, has climbed to an all-time high, reaching a level that he once described as \"playing with fire.\"",

Trump said the tariffs on those countries were for not stopping the flow of that deadly drug into the United States.Trump had invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the tariffs.On Sunday, Trump wrote, \"If a President is not allowed to use Tariffs, we will be at a major disadvantage against all other Countries throughout the World, especially the 'Majors.' \"\"In a true sense, we would be defenseless,\" he said.watch now",

    "body": "MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria arrives at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 9, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDatabase software maker MongoDB said on Monday that CEO Dev Ittycheria is stepping down from the top job after an 11-year run. Chirantan \"CJ\" Desai, who has spent the past year as president of product and engineering at Cloudflare, is replacing Ittycheria, effective Nov. 10, MongoDB said. Ittycheria will remain on the company's board. \"Earlier this year, I would say as part of our normal succession planning process, the board asked me about my long-term plans and whether I could commit for another five years as CEO,\" Ittycheria told CNBC in an interview. \"I thought long and hard about it, and I talked to my family, I talked to the board and ultimately realized I couldn't make that kind of decision.\"Before joining MongoDB, Ittycheria was president of BMC, which bought his company BladeLogic for $854 million in 2008. As BladeLogic's co-founder and CEO, Ittycheria took the company public in 2007. He's also been an investor at venture firms OpenView and Greylock.Ittycheria led MongoDB's IPO in 2017, three years after taking the helm. The company won over individual software developers thanks to its database's architecture that could store a variety of data in documents, challenging market incumbents like Oracle.Under Ittycheria, the company prioritized cloud subscriptions, landed multi-year deals, partnered with rival cloud providers Amazon and Microsoft and expanded the software's capabilities into generative artificial intelligence. MongoDB's stock closed on Friday at $359.82, representing a fifteenfold gain since the IPO and lifting the company's market cap to almost $30 billion. MongoDB's net loss in the July quarter narrowed to $47 million from $54.5 million a year earlier, while revenue rose 24% to $591 million.Cloudflare said in a filing on Thursday that Desai would step down on Nov. 7, to become CEO \"at another notable, publicly-traded company.\" Desai previously served as operating chief at ServiceNow. He resigned in July 2024, after the software company found a policy violation with the hiring of the U.S. Army's chief information officer. Previously Desai held leadership positions at EMC and Symantec.\"We talked to people close to ServiceNow, as well as other people who know CJ really well, and we felt very, very comfortable that CJ is the right person to lead MongoDB in this next era,\" Ittycheria said.Desai, whose first job out of college was at Oracle, said he will split his time between New York and the San Francisco area. MongoDB also said it expects to exceed the high end of its guidance ranges for revenue and adjusted earnings per share in the fiscal third quarter. The top end of its range was 79 cents per share in earnings, and $592 million in revenue.Desai said he's \"looking forward to grow MongoDB to $5 billion-plus in a durable, profitable way, in revenues, and most importantly, to be the gold standard for modern database technology, no matter what kind of workloads exist.\" He did not offer a timeline for the revenue goal.Executives will discuss the leadership change on a conference call with analysts at 10 a.m. ET.WATCH: MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria on Q2 results: The opportunity in front of us is massivewatch now",

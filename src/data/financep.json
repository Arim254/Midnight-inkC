    "body": "Greg Abel speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCBerkshire Hathaway's Greg Abel used his first annual shareholder letter as chief executive to reassure investors that the conglomerate's culture of financial conservatism and disciplined investing established under Warren Buffett will continue \"into perpetuity.\"\"I am honored by our Board's decision to appoint me CEO of Berkshire and humbled to succeed Warren as I write my first annual letter to you,\" Abel wrote in the missive to begin the company's annual report released Saturday along with Berkshire's quarterly earnings. \"Warren is obviously a very hard act to follow.\"Abel, 63, signaled continuity rather than change as he takes the reins from the 95-year-old Buffett, who stepped down as CEO at the start of 2026 and remains chairman. The new CEO laid out a clear framework of foundational values for how he intends to keep running the conglomerate: to preserve its financial strength and maintain strict capital discipline.\"We maintain a fortress-like balance sheet, ensuring Berkshire's foundation is never compromised,\" he wrote. \"We preserve this financial strength by using debt sparingly and prudently. Our substantial liquidity enables us to meet our obligations even under the most adverse conditions and to respond swiftly when opportunities arise.\"Other values he highlighted included a decentralized management model and \"reputation for integrity.\"Berkshire's cash pile stood at $373.3 billion at the end of 2025. Abel described the mountain of cash as strategic dry powder, which allows the company to act decisively when opportunities surface without jeopardizing resilience. Abel also used the letter to push back on any notion that the sizable cash position signified that Berkshire was retreating from investing. But Abel noted he will continue Berkshire's long-standing resistance to paying a dividend.\"Our approach to cash dividends continues to be that Berkshire will not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders is reasonably likely to be created by each dollar of retained earnings,\" Abel wrote, adding that the board reviews the policy annually.Overseeing stock portfolio Abel emphasized that Berkshire applies the same disciplined framework whether it is acquiring an entire business, buying shares of a public company or repurchasing its own stock.\"We will assess value carefully, act patiently, and hold for the long term — preferably forever,\" he wrote.He added that Berkshire's equity portfolio will remains concentrated in a small group of American companies, including Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Moody's, that he said Berkshire expects to compound over decades. Notably absent from that list was Bank of America, which ranked as Berkshire's third largest holding at the end of 2025.Abel said the concentrated approach will continue, with limited trading activity, though Berkshire would \"significantly adjust\" a position if long-term economic prospects change.He also settled a key question hanging over the leadership transition: he will directly oversee the equity portfolio. Ted Weschler will continue to manage about 6% of the portfolio, including investments previously overseen by Todd Combs, an investment manager and Geico CEO who left for JPMorgan recently. \"At Berkshire, equity investments are fundamental to our capital allocation activities; responsibility ultimately resides with me as CEO,\" Abel wrote.Long-term commitmentAbel has been known internally as a hands-on operator with a deep bench of subsidiary CEOs reporting to him. The Canadian executive, born in Edmonton, Alberta, has a 25-year tenure at Berkshire under his belt. Abel joined Berkshire in 2000 when the conglomerate bought MidAmerican Energy, where he eventually became the CEO in 2008. Prior to that, Abel worked at CalEnergy where he transformed the small geothermal firm into a diversified energy business.He underscored that he views the role as a long-term commitment as he intends to steward Berkshire for decades.\"Our owners' time horizon extends beyond the tenure of any individual CEO,\" he wrote. \"I will not be your CEO for the next 60 years as simple arithmetic makes that – shall we say – an ambitious plan. However, 20 years from now, when I will have just a fraction of the tenure that Warren had, my intention is that you – or your descendants – will be proud that your company is even stronger.\"He noted that Buffett remains actively engaged as chairman, coming into the office five days a week and continuing to provide input.Abel also made clear that Berkshire will not adopt Wall Street's typical cadence of quarterly earnings calls. \"We concentrate on quality, not frequency. If a significant issue arises, you will hear from me, but it will not be through quarterly commentary, given our long-term horizon,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., gestures at the United Center, on Day 1 of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Aug. 19, 2024.Mike Segar | ReutersHouse Democrats this week laid out their plans to counter President Donald Trump's rhetoric about \"nationalizing\" this year's elections ahead of the 2026 midterms. The lawmakers convened at their annual policy retreat, where they set their agenda for the year and hone campaign messaging. They met in northern Virginia this week following Trump's escalating calls for voter-ID requirements at the polls and his desire to require presenting documents to register to vote, both changes that would likely disenfranchise voters across the U.S. A pending Supreme Court decision on the Voting Rights Act also looms large, and Trump has said he is considering ways of imposing the changes he wants even if Congress does not pass legislation.\"This is a five alarm fire,\" Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said at a Congressional Black Caucus press conference at the retreat's close on Friday. \"We are going to fight back, and we are going to use every tool in the toolkit.\"Sewell, who is also a member of the House Administration Committee that has jurisdiction over federal elections, said options include litigating, legislating and mobilizing. But with a minority in both chambers, Democrats are somewhat limited in the run-up to the pivotal 2026 midterm elections that will decide control of the House.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S.-Iran strikes live updates: Explosions heard as retaliation targets U.S. military basesCongress takes on Nvidia, White House as it pushes for chip export limitsWarren calls Trump’s bluff on affordability after State of the UnionHouse Dems project midterm optimism at annual policy retreat following State of the Union\"The vast majority of Americans support President Trump's commonsense election integrity agenda, Democrat politicians should too,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an emailed statement. Trump in recent months has again become laser-focused on elections, rehashing some of his old, unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential contest being \"rigged\" and noncitizens voting. It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and instances are rare. The FBI in January seized ballots in Fulton County, Ga., a precinct that Trump lost to Joe Biden.The president has recently called to \"nationalize\" elections. He has pushed for the Senate to pass a controversial bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register and photo identification to cast a ballot. \"President Trump is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,\" Jackson said in her statement. \"[The] President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.\"Trump threatened earlier this month to unilaterally impose voter ID restrictions ahead of November's elections. MS NOW reported Thursday that he has instructed White House lawyers to review the feasibility of such an order. And the Washington Post reported that a group of pro-Trump activist is circulating a draft executive order to effectuate that goal that is premised on Chinese interference in the 2020 election.Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said these attempts have \"shaky\" legal footing. \"I'm deeply skeptical of any evidence that they suddenly have six years later,\" Morelle said in an interview at the retreat.Morelle, in his capacity as the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, is leading House Democrats' response to the Trump administration's elections priorities. He's also preparing for the potential fallout from a challenge to a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that, if upheld, could eliminate some majority-minority Democratic-held districts. The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on that case sometime between now and June.That Democratic effort includes war-gaming different potential election scenarios, working on litigation and crafting messaging, Morelle said. Sewell, meanwhile, said the CBC has held several all-day sessions on the topic of voting rights to help hone its response.\"One of the things I think we really need to focus on, especially in the wake of the seizure of the ballots in Fulton County, is there's got to be a strong legal basis that we lay out now that's in objection to what they're doing on that front,\" Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., said at the CBC press conference.Democrats also articulated fears that Trump could deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and National Guard members to polling places as a means of voter suppression in November. \"Every year we do a grassroots piece where you have people, poll watchers and the like. But it's got to be supercharged, on steroids this time around,\" Ivey said. \"We've seen this movie before. It's been a long time since it was this overt, but I think we have to have people who are trained and ready to be in all of these polling places.\"Saving democracy vs. affordability?Democrats were laser focused on cost-of-living issues throughout the retreat, which included appearances by Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger and organized labor leaders. Affordability is already shaping up to be a key message to voters for Democrats this year.But Morelle said members are \"acutely attuned\" to potential threats to elections. Most of the conversations he had during the retreat were related to election security, he said.Still, after their message on Trump's threats to democracy fell flat in the 2024 cycle, they face a strategic challenge: Does raising the election issue take away from their messaging on the economy? \"You can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a member of the CBC and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview. Affordability is the top concern, Waters said, but \"Democrats have to be very concerned about what the president is doing — it is literally voter suppression.\"Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee and a former member of the House Jan. 6 Select Committee, and Morelle both said Democrats do not have to choose one or the other.\"I don't buy the argument that we either have to talk about popular democracy or we have to talk about middle-class affordability,\" Raskin said in an interview. \"To me, these are the same issue. We need government that is going to be an instrument for the common good of all the people, and not an instrument for the corrupt self enrichment of the guy who gets in and his family and his friends.\"\"I don't think [Americans] think about it sort of in an esoteric, theoretical way, 'democracy needs to be defended,'\" Morelle said. \"I think what they are growing in their awareness is, our access to the ballot has a great deal to do with the decisions that will affect the bottom line for my family.\"",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersUBS' top equity strategist dialed back his view on U.S. stocks, citing mounting risks from a weakening dollar, stretched valuations and policy turbulence in Washington.Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at the investment bank, downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\" in a fully invested global equity portfolio, arguing that the factors that powered years of outperformance are starting to fade.The dollar risk is a central concern, Garthwaite wrote. UBS forecasts the euro climbing to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter and sees \"asymmetric structural downside risks\" to the greenback. Historically, when the dollar's trade-weighted index falls 10%, U.S. equities underperform by roughly 4% in unhedged terms, according to the bank. Foreign markets are trouncing the U.S. this year as a weaker dollar and cheaper valuations draw capital overseas. The MSCI World ex-US index has gained about 8% in 2026, compared with the little changed performance for the S&P 500. Japan's Nikkei 225 has rallied 17% year to date, while the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7%, underscoring a sharp rotation away from American equities. U.S. stocks struggled again Friday as investors fretted over the potential downsides of the artificial intelligence build-out and persistent inflation at home.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 year to dateAnother pillar of U.S. stock strength — corporate buybacks — is also losing its edge, the bank said. The buyback yield in the U.S. is now only roughly on par with global peers, eroding what had been a key support for earnings per share growth and investor flows, UBS said. The combined shareholder yield from dividends and buybacks in the U.S. is now about half that of Europe, the bank said.\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" Garthwaite wrote.Valuations add to the unease. UBS calculates that the sector-adjusted price-earnings ratio for U.S. stocks is 35% above international peers, versus an average premium of about 4% since 2010. Roughly 60% of sectors trade not only at higher multiples than their global counterparts but also above their own historical premium, the strategist wrote.Policy volatility under President Donald Trump is another headwind. This year has brought shifts in tariff policy, proposals to cap credit card interest rates, potential limits on private equity investment in housing, renewed scrutiny of drug pricing, and suggestions to curb dividends and buybacks for defense companies, UBS said.Still, the noted strategist stopped short of turning outright bearish. Garthwaite said the U.S. economy and equities tend to benefit more than peers when markets are in the early phases of a potential bubble. The bank also expects artificial intelligence adoption to outpace most other major regions, with the possible exception of China, helping sustain earnings growth across key industries.UBS strategist Sean Simonds set a year-end target of 7,500 for the S&P 500, compared with an average forecast of 7,629 among 14 top strategists, according to CNBC Pro's strategist survey.

(Photo by AFP via Getty Images)- | Afp | Getty ImagesMarket watchers are bracing for turbulence after the U.S. confirmed it has launched \"major combat operations\" in Iran, a move investors say could carry far greater market consequences than the recent run of geopolitical flare-ups.U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. military has begun \"major combat operations\" in Iran.Several ministries in the southern part of the Iranian capital, Tehran, were targeted, Reuters quoted an unidentified Iranian official as saying.Markets have been unfazed and accustomed to absorbing recent geopolitical and economic shocks and headlines, including Trump's announcement of a hike in U.S. tariffs on all imports to 15%, as well as the administration's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\"This has definitely bigger ramifications than Venezuela,\" said Florian Weidinger, CIO at Santa Lucia Asset Management. \"Venezuela was ... only really relevant for people who care about that particular heavy crude,\" Weidinger told CNBC. The country's heavy, sour crude can be challenging to extract, though it is prized by specific, complex refineries, particularly in the U.S. \"That's why it's a bigger risk. You would expect oil to tick up a bit more violently next week as a result of that,\" he added.Oil to shoot up, pivot to safetyVenezuela currently produces an average of 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day, well below its peak of 3.5 million barrels per day, or bpd, in the 1990s.\"Venezuela was a production story. [Iran] is a chokepoint story,\" said Kenneth Goh, director of private wealth management at UOB Kay Hian in Singapore. Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the strait is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points. About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, according to data from market intelligence firm Kpler.In June 2025, when Israel struck Iranian nuclear sites, equities sold off sharply at the open, then recovered once it became clear the strait was not disrupted.\"That is the pattern markets will reference on Monday,\" Goh said, adding that there could be a flight to safety with a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and a rush into gold. Other market watchers echoed the same. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, similarly expects a \"rough and risk-off\" open on Monday, with global equities potentially down 1% to 2% or more, U.S. Treasury yields falling 5 to 10 basis points, and oil jumping 5% to 10%.But \"no hero bets,\" she said, cautioning that investors should wait for Iran's response.Short campaign vs. 'regime change endeavor'That said, some money managers said that risk-off positioning has been building for weeks, potentially providing some buffer against initial volatility once trading gets underway.Weidinger noted that some cross-asset moves have already reflected \"a little bit of a crisis environment,\" citing firmer oil and stronger demand for Treasurys in recent weeks.While the markets have anticipated this development, investors are closely monitoring whether the latest move by the U.S. remains a short, concentrated campaign or escalates into a prolonged regional conflict.Quantum Strategy's David Roche framed the market impact in terms of duration and whether Iran would attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz. If the conflict is short and contained, he said, the risk-off move and oil spike could be brief. If it turns into a longer, three-to-five-week \"regime change endeavor,\" markets would react \"rather badly\" as investors price in a wider conflict and longer oil disruption.A prolonged retaliation by Iran would also be particularly impactful for Asian markets, given their reliance on stable energy supplies and trade routes, said Global X ETFs' investment strategist Billy Leung, who expects global equities to open lower with heightened volatility, especially in high-beta and cyclical sectors. ",

David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesRep. Nancy Mace on Friday said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick should testify to the House Oversight Committee to answer questions about his association with notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.\"Howard Lutnick should take questions from the Oversight committee,\" Mace, R-S.C., said in an X post on Friday morning.Mace's tweet responded to an X post that said the Department of Justice had removed from its database of Epstein-related documents a photo of Epstein standing in front of a man who \"appears to be Howard Lutnick.\"It is not known when the photo, which since has been restored to the DOJ's public database, was taken.A photo from the DOJ's Epstein files database, appears to show Jeffrey Epstein and three other men. Other men in the photo appear to include Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his friend Michael Lehrman.Source: Epstein Files | DOJBut it appears to include, in addition to Epstein, Lutnick and his friend Michael Lehrman, who other documents in the DOJ's database indicated was vacationing with Lutnick and his family when they all visited Epstein for lunch on his private island in December 2012.Lutnick has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Mace later Friday morning told reporters, \"I will be asking\" Lutnick to testify to the Oversight committee.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., separately told reporters that he believed there would be enough votes on the committee to subpoena Lutnick to testify.The lawmakers' comments came before that panel was set to question former President Bill Clinton in a deposition about his connections to Epstein in Chappaqua, New York.Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was deposed about Epstein on Thursday. She told reporters later that she testified she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and that she had no knowledge of his crimes.House Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Thursday told reporters that it is \"very possible\" that the panel will subpoena Lutnick to testify.Comer has not called President Donald Trump to testify.Trump, who had a longtime friendship with Epstein before the two men fell out in the early 2000s, has said that the recently released files on Epstein by the DOJ exonerate him of any wrongdoing.MS Now reported earlier this week that the DOJ withheld from public disclosure memos and notes about FBI interviews, including those of a woman who has alleged that Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor.The DOJ, in response to that and other similar reporters, had said, \"If files are temporarily pulled for victim redactions or to redact Personally Identifiable Information, then those documents are promptly  restored online and are publicly available.\"Lutnick, in testimony on Feb. 10, to the Senate Appropriations Committee, admitted that he and his family had lunch with Epstein in December 2012 at Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sits to testify before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing to examine a review of broadband deployment funding at the Department of Commerce, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 10, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersLutnick's testimony came after he had claimed that he cut off contact with his New York City neighbor Epstein in 2005, three years before Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.DOJ files show that Lutnick remained in communication with Epstein years later.MS Now reported on Feb. 10 that, \"In 2015, Lutnick appeared to invite Epstein to an 'intimate' fundraising event for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which Lutnick had been fundraising for at the time.\"\"In 2017, Epstein donated $50,000 to a New York charity in honor of Lutnick, according to the files,\" MS Now reported.Documents also indicate that Epstein and Lutnick \"each signed on behalf of limited liability companies that agreed on Dec. 28, 2012, to acquire stakes in a now-shuttered advertising technology company called Adfin,\" CBS News reported previously.Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.",

According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, the Defense Department used Anthropic's Claude Ai, via its Palantir contract, to help with the attack on Venezuela and capture former President Nicolás Maduro.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesAnthropic's Claude artificial intelligence assistant app jumped to the No. 2 slot on Apple's chart of top U.S. free apps late on Friday, hours after the Trump administration sought to block government agencies' adoption of the startup's technology.The rise in popularity suggests that Anthropic is benefiting from its presence in news headlines, stemming from its refusal to have its models used for mass domestic surveillance or for fully autonomous weapons. \"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution,\" President Donald Trump wrote in a Friday Truth Social post.Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he asked that Anthropic be labeled as a supply-chain risk to national security, and therefore, no U.S. defense contractor would be able to draw on Anthropic tools.\"It is the Department's prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision,\" Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in a statement. \"But given the substantial value that Anthropic's technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.\"Historically, other AI chat apps have been more popular among consumers than Claude. OpenAI's ChatGPT sat at No. 1 on the App Store rankings on Saturday, while Google's Gemini was at No. 3. The Claude iOS app has gained momentum this month. On Jan. 30, it was ranked No. 131 in the U.S., and it bounced around the top 20 for much of February, according to data from analytics company Sensor Tower. The data shows ChatGPT has held on to the No. 1 spot for most of February.In the past year, Anthropic — which was formed in 2021 by former OpenAI employees — has gained momentum as a supplier of models for coding and general corporate use. OpenAI, whose ChatGPT now has over 900 million weekly users, has been responding to Anthropic's surge in business by striking partnerships with consulting firms such as Accenture and Capgemini.On Friday night, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the startup had reached an agreement with the U.S. Defense Department on the deployment of its models.Hours later, pop singer Katy Perry posted a screenshot of Anthropic's Pro subscription for consumers, with a heart superimposed over it.WATCH: Sec.

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Friday dismissed the Trump administration's request to eliminate a student loan repayment plan that lowered monthly bills for millions of borrowers.Judge John Ross of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order dismissing the multistate lawsuit blocking the enactment of the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, federal student loan repayment plan.The Trump administration's failed bid to block the SAVE plan means that borrowers should have access to the program's benefits, at least for now, consumer advocates said. Those include lower monthly payments and a faster timeline to forgiveness.\"As of today, not only is there no legal barrier to delivering those rights through the SAVE plan, but the secretary has a legal obligation to do so,\" said Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at Protect Borrowers.

Here's whyCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedMore than 7 million student loan borrowers remain enrolled in the SAVE plan, as of the fourth quarter, according to the Education Department. Those borrowers were placed in forbearance during the legal challenges, meaning they didn't owe monthly payments. Their loans have been accruing interest since August.The court order may be a temporary reprieve, and it's unclear how the Trump administration will respond. President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out the SAVE plan as of July 1, 2028. How the SAVE plan worksThe Biden administration introduced the SAVE plan in 2023, billing the program as \"the most affordable repayment plan ever created.\" But just as many of the SAVE plan's benefits were taking effect, Republican-led legal challenges put the program on hold. One of the hallmarks of SAVE is a faster timeline to forgiveness compared to other income-driven repayment, or IDR, plans, which typically offer forgiveness after 20 to 25 years. Under the SAVE plan, borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less are eligible to have their loans forgiven after 10 years of monthly payments. For every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount, the repayment period increases by one year — up to 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans.For example, an undergraduate borrower with a starting balance of $15,000 would need to make payments on SAVE for 13 years in order to qualify for loan forgiveness.Another benefit of SAVE was lower payments than those under other IDR plans.Monthly payments on SAVE were originally capped at 10% of discretionary income, and slated to drop to 5% of discretionary income in 2024. Borrowers with incomes at or below the federal poverty level would qualify for $0 monthly payments.The SAVE plan also includes a cap on interest. Any interest that accrues above a borrower's monthly payment is waived. If $50 in interest accumulates on your loans in a month, but your payment is only $30, you won't be charged the additional $20, for example. Borrowers who qualify for $0 monthly payments would not see additional interest charges on their debt.",

    "body": "watch nowWholesale prices rose at a faster-than-expected pace in January, countering hopes that inflation was easing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The core producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8%, more than the 0.6% gain in December and well ahead of the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 0.3%.On an all-items basis, the headline PPI rose 0.5%, also above the forecast for 0.3% and 0.1 percentage point more than the prior month.For the full year, core wholesale prices accelerated 3.6%, while the headline index posted a 2.9% gain. Both figures are well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal and suggest that rising prices are still a factor for the U.S. economy.Stock market futures added to losses following the report. Services prices primarily drove the increase, with a 0.8% monthly rise that was the highest since July 2025. By contrast, goods prices actually fell 0.3%, though core goods prices climbed 0.7%.More than 20% of the increase in services came from margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. On the goods side, energy and food prices both fell while metals prices rose 4.8%.Trade services prices surged 2.5%, helping boost pressures on wholesale inflation.The report comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation has been tamed. Pipeline pressures as indicated by the PPI figures could keep the Fed cautious as it weighs its next moves on interest rates. Markets largely expect the Fed to stay on the sidelines until the summer, though Trump and other White House officials have pushed for lower rates.Economists have worried that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher, though Fed officials largely expect the impact to be temporary. There was some evidence of tariffs in the PPI data, with indexes for apparel and other goods such as intermediate components moving higher.Trump lost a key Supreme Court ruling that overturned his move to use emergency measures to implement the tariffs. However, the president has cited other authorities that will allow him to implement the duties anyway.",

    "body": "An American flag flies at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California, on Sept. 12, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board may have enriched its shareholders Thursday when it chose Paramount Skydance's acquisition offer over Netflix's, but it also terrified a lot of its employees.While some of those people own WBD shares and may prefer the financials of Paramount's $31-per-share bid to Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer, CNBC spoke to 10 WBD employees in a variety of different roles at the company. All 10, who asked not to be named for fear of potential backlash, expressed concerns about potential job losses and questions of who would ultimately run their divisions if Paramount and WBD are eventually merged.\"It's fair to say people are deflated by the news,\" said one long-term WBD executive.Nonetheless, a WBD-Paramount merger \"is not a done deal,\" as California Attorney General Rob Bonta said yesterday. The transaction must gain regulatory approval both in the U.S. and in Europe. WBD CEO David Zaslav acknowledged at an all-hands meeting Friday that the deal may still be blocked and expressed sympathy for those experiencing a sense of whiplash going from Netflix to Paramount, according to people familiar with the matter.\"The deal may not close. If it doesn't close, we get $7 billion, and we get back to work,\" Zaslav said, according to leaked audio provided to Business Insider. watch nowStill, several WBD employees told CNBC they wished Netflix had acquired WBD, citing several factors.While Paramount and WBD both have core competencies in news, sports, theatrical film and streaming TV, Netflix has far less overlap. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos repeatedly said he planned to leave the WBD business alone, keeping its theatrical business separate from Netflix while also keeping HBO Max as a separate, independent streaming service for the foreseeable future. Netflix also wasn't acquiring WBD's linear cable business with its bid. Employees at CNN, TNT Sports and the old Discovery networks would have remained in their jobs to forge a path as a standalone publicly traded company.Now, WBD employees are staring at potentially massive job cuts. Paramount executives have previously stated they plan to cut $6 billion by eliminating \"duplicative operations\" on \"back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure, et cetera,\" according to Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon. Both WBD and Paramount have already gone through thousands of job cuts in recent years. There are also questions about culture and leadership. While Mark Thompson currently runs CNN, Bari Weiss is the editor-in-chief at CBS News and could plausibly have CNN added to her purview. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Paramount CEO David Ellison promised President Donald Trump he'd make sweeping changes at CNN if he gained control of the network. Three CNN employees who spoke with CNBC said there's rampant fear among their colleagues about Weiss making dramatic changes to the cable network's anchors and tone.\"Despite all the speculation you've read during this process, I'd suggest that you don't jump to conclusions about the future until we know more,\" Thompson wrote in a memo to employees Thursday. CNN media reporter Brian Stelter noted CNN \"is a highly profitable business, and it would be foolish for any owner to put that at risk.\"On the entertainment side, WBD employees fear there may be too many proverbial cooks in the kitchen, which could bog down creativity and innovation for both film and TV. One WBD executive noted that Paramount's President Jeff Shell, Chair of Direct to Consumer Cindy Holland and Chair of TV George Cheeks are all used to being senior leaders in their organizations. Shell was CEO of NBCUniversal. Cheeks was co-CEO of Paramount before it merged with Skydance. Holland was a top executive at Netflix, where she worked for 18 years. How that mix meshes with WBD's entertainment leadership group is an open question and could lead to culture clashes.TNT Sports is run by Luis Silberwasser and has largely steered WBD toward younger audiences with its programming decisions and investments, including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights. CBS Sports, meanwhile, is driven by the demographics of those who watch CBS and has historically catered to an older audience. This could lead to culture clash, or the divisions could mesh nicely as complementary assets.While Silberwasser will have to work with CBS Sports President David Berson on employee duplications, like every other department, there's some reason for optimism in the sports division, because WBD and CBS have worked together for many years producing March Madness, the NCAA men's basketball tournament. That's given the units some degree of familiarity with each other. WBD also lost NBA rights last season. Combining with CBS' robust portfolio of sports rights, including the NFL and the Masters, makes WBD a major player again in sports, even if it's as a subsidiary of CBS. One other repeated concern among employees is the $64 billion in debt coming as part of the $111 billion enterprise value for the deal. Several employees said servicing large debt loads has hindered WBD in recent years, and they feared this could lead to more of the same. Two employees noted there's comfort being a part of a giant company like Netflix, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion. Paramount Skydance's market valuation is just $15 billion. ",

    "body": "watch nowTwo of the largest U.S. gym operators delivered the same headline in their latest earnings reports: strong growth.But beneath the surface, Life Time Group Holdings and Planet Fitness told very different stories about the American consumer. They highlighted a widening divide between higher-income households that continue to spend freely and more price-sensitive consumers who are beginning to show signs of strain. The Planet Fitness logo is seen on the outside of its gym at the Loyal Plaza in Loyalsock Township, Pennsylvania.Paul Weaver | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBoth companies reported double-digit percentage revenue growth, rising memberships and expanding footprints in 2025. Their respective outlooks for 2026, however, point to a \"K-shaped\" economy, a term used to describe a split in spending trends between higher and lower-income groups. Here's what we learned. Life Time: Affluent consumers keep spendingLife Time's earnings reinforced that affluent Americans are still shelling out, especially on their health and wellness.In the fourth quarter, the company's total revenue rose 12.3% year over year to $745.1 million. CFO Erik Weaver attributed the increase to \"continued execution in our centers,\" including higher average dues and stronger utilization of in-center businesses.The company, which operates large-format fitness clubs with amenities like pools, spas and cafes, increased membership dues last year by roughly $10 to $30 per member. The change did not slow demand — membership and engagement have continued to climb.A growing share of Life Time's revenue is coming from in-center spending, which topped $191 million in the fourth quarter.  Members are taking full advantage of additional personal training, spa services and food and beverage as they treat the space as a lifestyle destination. Average revenue per center membership was $882, up 10.8%. \"It's a super engaged membership model instead of a non-use membership model,\" said Life Time Group Holdings CEO Bahram Akradi. \"We are basically operating at optimal levels of that right now.\"Despite having far fewer locations than Planet Fitness, the company generates significantly more revenue, underscoring the higher spending power of its customer base. \"The model proved its resilience throughout a macro-challenged 2025 in which in-center revenue grew,\" said Mizuho analyst John Baumgartner. \"And see downside risks limited by a memberships skew favoring high-income households and differentiated club activities.\"The results suggest higher-income consumers remain relatively insulated from broader economic pressures and continue prioritizing discretionary wellness spending. Planet Fitness: Sales grow, but outlook disappointsThe strength area of the new Planet Fitness at 226 Harvard Avenue in Allston. Pat Greenhouse | Boston Globe | Getty ImagesPlanet Fitness also reported strong growth, adding 1.1 million new members in 2025 and delivering double-digit percentage revenue gains. Investors, however, focused on its outlook, which fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company projected slower fiscal 2026 revenue growth of 9% and weaker same-store sales than expected at 4% to 5%, which raised demand concerns. However, Planet Fitness remained positive about growth, saying the anticipated pullback in membership was temporary.\"Our join trends were impacted by the storms and cold weather in late January across many of our markets, and we experienced a slightly higher cancel rate last month than anticipated,\" said Planet Fitness CFO Jay Stasz. \"Notably, recent attrition trends are returning in line with our expectations.\"Planet Fitness has also been testing price hikes in some markets, which it expects to fully roll out in summer 2026. It's also investing in new amenities like red light therapy and additional classes to increase revenue per member and attract younger members. That strategy could support long-term growth, but some analysts are skeptical, saying the \"guidance gap\" between Planet Fitness' results and Wall Street expectations is particularly frustrating.\"The company now faces a credibility hurdle,\" said Stifel analyst Chris Cull. \"Is 2026 guidance conservative, or are the out-year targets unrealistic? Until the company provides a clearer path to acceleration, we expect the stock will likely churn.\"A softened 2026 outlook suggested some uncertainty about how much further its core customers can stretch their spending.The widening consumer divideTogether the results highlight a broader shift in the U.S. economy. Higher-income consumers, reflected in Life Time's performance, continue to absorb price increases and spend on premium experiences. Meanwhile, Planet Fitness suggest even though price-sensitive customers are engaged, they're more reluctant to spend.That's not a problem unique to fitness and has appeared across industries. Airlines are racing to build out luxury offerings as higher-income travelers continue to spend. Meanwhile, fast-food companies are leaning on value meals to attract more price-sensitive customers, reinforcing the idea of a K-shaped economy. Planet Fitness' performance in the coming quarters could serve as an indicator of how much discretionary spending capacity remains for lower- and middle-income consumers.William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia lowered her firm's projections for Planet Fitness' 2026 member growth to 800,000 from 1 million given projected weakness in the first quarter, which typically accounts for 60% of full-year sign-ups. Still, the guidance did not dampen the firm's optimism about the company.\"We reiterate our Outperform rating and continue to view the brand's long-term outlook as robust given its industry-leading low-price/non-intimidating club format,\" said Zackfia.For now the fitness industry is offering a clear signal: Consumer spending remains strong, but is increasingly divided.",

    "body": "Intrinsic CEO Wendy Tan White has led the company to graduate out of Alphabet's \"Moonshot\" factory X.IntrinsicGoogle became a powerhouse in smartphones by creating the Android operating system and partnering with handset makers in need of an answer to Apple's iPhone. Now the search giant has a similar plan for tackling robotics. Earlier this week, Google announced that Intrinsic, an internal robotics software project, will be moved from the \"Other Bets\" category into the main company.Just as Android runs across phones and tablets from devices made by Samsung, Motorola, China's Xiaomi and others, Intrinsic does the same for robotic systems, though the partnering companies have far less recognizable names. They include FANUC, Universal Robots and KUKA, which all primarily focus on industrial robots. Prospective competitors include Amazon and Tesla. McKinsey projects the market for general purpose robots could reach $370 billion by 2040, opening up a potentially large opportunity for Google as artificial intelligence moves from the digital world of chatbots, image generation and AI agents to the physical world. Intrinsic says on its website that it's building an operating system so manufacturers \"can focus more on solving the problem, and not the plumbing.\" Like with Android, developers tap ready-made capabilities from Intrinsic to develop applications more efficiently.\"We're trying to make it accessible for anyone,\" Intrinsic CEO Wendy Tan White told CNBC in an interview last year. \"It doesn't matter what the hardware is and it doesn't matter what the AI model is. We will help you put that together so you can have access to it.\" By being inside Google, Intrinsic will be closer to the company's AI models, infrastructure and cloud tools. It will continue operating as a distinct group within Google, remaining under the Intrinsic brand and the leadership of Tan White, who helmed the company as it graduated from Alphabet's X \"moonshot factory\" in 2021. watch nowGoogle has a complicated history with robotics. In 2013, Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics, known for its walking robots, and Schaft, a Japanese humanoid robotics company. It also purchased several vision startups. After several years spent trying to build a clear business in the space, Google sold Boston Dynamics and Schaft in 2017 to SoftBank for an undisclosed amount. The recent explosion in AI has changed the game. In mid-2025, Google debuted two new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER (extended reasoning), bringing generative AI into physical action commands to control robots. Google said in a blog post at the time that it would partner with Apptronik, a Texas-based robotics developer, to \"build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0.\"Last month, Google teamed up with Boston Dynamics to integrate Gemini into Atlas humanoid robots built for manufacturing environments. In November, Google's DeepMind unit hired the former CTO of Boston Dynamics.Intrinsic's team will work closely with DeepMind's AI technology stack, from research and model development through deployment and daily operations in manufacturing and logistics, the company said. It will also work more closely with Google's Gemini, infrastructure and cloud teams.Intrinsic technology chief Brian Gerkey said in an interview that the company has the advantage of building on top of DeepMind's models, adding specialized data and \"standing on the shoulders\" of its technology.Late last year, Intrinsic and Foxconn announced a partnership to deploy AI robots for electronics assembly in Foxconn's U.S. factories. AI server manufacturing in its current form is primarily a mix of rigid automation and manual production. Google has been pouring money into data centers and hardware to try and keep up with soaring usage of AI tools and models. Amin Vahdat, Google's AI infrastructure boss, told employees that the company has to double its serving capacity every six months in order to meet demand for AI services, CNBC reported in November.\"You want to push into the areas where there's a lot of investment going into the end market,\" Tan White said. \"And right now, the electronics market is just going nuts, partly because of the need for more products and compute. There's huge demand.\" A 2025 Deloitte survey of 600 manufacturing executives found that 80% of respondents plan to invest 20% or more of their improvement budgets in smart manufacturing initiatives, with a focus on foundational tools and technologies. Intrinsic's flagship product, Flowstate, is a web-based platform that allows users to build robotic applications without having to write thousands of lines of code. The company also has open-source tools that can help with building robot applications, similar to Google's approach with Android. Tan White said that Google CEO Sundar Pichai has even made the comparison to the company's mobile strategy.\"He said this is the Android of robotics,\" Tan White said, noting that Pichai worked on Chrome and Android before he became CEO. \"I think he has a lot of credibility.\"WATCH: AI robots may outnumber working human population in a few decadeswatch now",

    "body": "Xiaomi launched the Xiaomi 17 Ultra at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on March 28. 2026.XiaomiXiaomi launched its latest flagship smartphones globally on Saturday as an unprecedented surge in memory chip prices threatens to dampen sales. The Xiaomi 17 and 17 Ultra represent the Chinese technology giant's top tier devices aimed at challenging the likes of Samsung and Apple in the high-end segment of the market.Xiaomi, which is the third-largest smartphone player globally, has maintained the prices of the devices versus last year's flagship, even amid the huge jump in memory prices that are critical for smartphones. The Xiaomi 17 starts at 999 euros ($1,179) while the Xiaomi 17 Ultra starts at 1,499 euros. In the first quarter of the year so far, memory prices have soared between 80% and 90%, Counterpoint Research said. This surge has been driven by a shortage of memory chips with supply being directed toward data centers for AI. Memory is an expensive component in a smartphone. Smartphone prices could rise 13% in 2026, according to a Gartner forecast from Februrary. IDC forecasts the smartphone market to decline 12.9% in 2026 as a result of the chip crunch.Analysts suggest companies selling more expensive phones will be more insulated and able to absorb the cost.The bulk of Xiaomi's volume comes from mid-range devices, a category that could take a hit to demand from any price rises. While its higher end devices will be unlikely to offset any losses.\"This year will be even worse because Xiaomi does not have a very strong premium share which means that they cannot rely on the premium segment to offset low margins in other devices like Apple and Samsung can,\" Francisco Jeronimo, a vice president for data and analytics at IDC, told CNBC. In November, Xiaomi management warned that the industry would likely have to raise smartphone prices in 2026. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said that Xiaomi will likely have to hike prices of their low-to-mid-tier devices. While Xiaomi still makes the bulk of revenue consumer electronics, the company has been ramping up its electric vehicle business in China, which now accounts for around a quarter of all sales. That's become an important source of revenue amid the memory crunch. Xiaomi reported a 3% year-on-year decline in smartphone revenue in the September quarter, the last publicly-available financial figures. But sales at its electric car business surged nearly 200%. ",

    "body": "Feeling disappointed by your job or job search? Two recent films might strike a chord.Park Chan-wook's \"No Other Choice\" and Sam Raimi's \"Send Help\" imagine what happens when workers in bad situations, whether a stagnant job market or a toxic workplace, are pushed to their limits, with murderous consequences. They offer cathartic, if violent, outlooks on the worker angst and desperation in the zeitgeist. Part dark comedy and part horror, they touch on perennial workplace anxieties but are particularly timely now.Sluggish hiring means many employees feel stuck, and many job seekers are struggling to find work. Last year, U.S. employers added only 181,000 jobs, compared to 1.46 million in 2024, making it the worst year for hiring since 2020, and the worst since 2003 outside of a recession. As of January, 1 in 4 unemployed people, roughly 1.8 million Americans, have been looking for work for more than six months, according to BLS data.Meanwhile, those with jobs are anxious about losing them amid economic uncertainty, AI adoption, and layoffs. Job cuts announced in January hit their highest monthly total to start a year since 2009, according to a report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. And the quits rate of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs — which can reflect their degree of confidence in the job market — stayed relatively low at around 2% throughout 2025.Against this backdrop, the films offer \"a way to feel in control of something you can't control,\" says Alicia Grandey, co-author of \"Emotionally Charged: How to Lead in the New World of Work\" and a workplace psychology professor at Penn State University. The films make our work anxieties feel \"distant and more controllable, like you can turn it off.\"That could be welcome distance for many feeling powerless in the job market and workplace today. Fear of losing your job can be \"paralyzing\" and feel \"like you have absolutely no control over the situation,\" career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin previously told CNBC Make It. The fact that \"work is the single most important way of proving your worth\" as a person in the U.S., Steven Vallas, professor emeritus of sociology at Northeastern University, previously told Make It, \"can really compound those feelings of shame and the anxiety about being unemployed.\" \"It's taking these feelings that many, many people have to an extreme\"Alicia GrandeyWorkplace psychology professor at Penn State UniversityThe extreme plotlines of \"No Other Choice\" and \"Send Help\" are part of their magic. \"It's taking these feelings that many, many people have to an extreme, so that you know it's not real,\" Grandey says. \"You can still revel in that power shift, you can still relate to the character, and recognize it's over-the-top fantasy, but absolutely, it's catharsis, it's venting.\"And then, she adds, \"when you come back to the real world, it by contrast doesn't seem as bad.\"Killing the competition\"No Other Choice,\" an adaptation of Donald Westlake's 1997 book, \"The Ax,\" follows a middle-aged Korean man, Yoo Man-su (Lee Byung-hun), who is laid off from a specialty papermaker after a business takeover. When his job applications for new positions go nowhere, and his family starts feeling the squeeze to their comfortable middle-class life, Man-su starts killing his fellow candidates to boost his chances of finding work.He tells his first victim, \"Sorry, but you must disappear for me to live.\"The film speaks to the desperation of job seekers today, the steep competition they face and the zero-sum calculus that dictates the job search for many candidates.In June, for example, LinkedIn said it had seen a 45% increase in the number of applications submitted on its platform in the past year, with roughly 10,000 applications sent every minute. In the fourth quarter of 2025, a ZipRecruiter survey saw its lowest Expectations Index — measuring how applicants think the job market will fare in the next six months — since the survey began in 2022, with 39.5% expecting a decrease in available positions in this period.On-screen as in reality, even those with jobs feel precarious in their positions. Job hugging has made headlines in recent months, a phenomenon that describes workers \"holding onto their jobs for dear life\" amid global uncertainty, fears of AI disruption and a tough job market, Korn Ferry consultants wrote in August.When Choi Seon-chul, a hotshot at a rival paper firm says he's swamped at work, Man-su tells him to faint so the higher-ups will hire Man-su to help divvy up the work. But the bosses wouldn't hire Man-su to help, Seon-chul retorts; they'd just fire Seon-chul instead.\"No Other Choice\" also touches on anxieties around AI-related job disruption. In Man-su's final interview in the film, the committee says the employer uses automation and plans to cut jobs soon. Man-su can only smile and concede, \"Of course. How can you go against the times?\" Spoiler alert: In the end, Man-su gets the job, in which he's the only human among many machines in a sterile factory. He celebrates and pumps his fists before his expression settles into a haunting, resigned acceptance. In this moment we see his prize is a dismal job, and one likely headed towards obsolescence at that. Even conventional markers of career success, like getting a long sought-after job, disappoint.Bringing home the baconWe see that disappointment at work in \"Send Help.\" The movie puts a workplace spin on the female rage film, where fed-up women finally explode, to dangerous effect. \"[It's] a fantasy of every person who's been mistreated at work.\"Alicia GrandeyWorkplace psychology professor at Penn State UniversityWorker bee Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams), has been snubbed for a promotion, had credit for her work stolen, and otherwise contended with a toxic workplace permeated by bro culture, all spearheaded by her awful boss, nepo baby CEO Bradley Preston (Dylan O'Brien). When Linda and Bradley are the only survivors of a plane crash on a deserted island, she sees an opportunity to turn the tables on her boss and get revenge for how he's treated her.It's \"a fantasy of every person who's been mistreated at work,\" Grandey says.There's a clear reversal of the manager-report power dynamic and gender roles the pair had in the office, where Bradley as CEO wielded power over Linda, who had hit a glass ceiling in their boys' club of a company. On the island, Liddle, a \"Survivor\" contestant hopeful, shelters and feeds them, hunting boar to quite literally bring home the bacon, while a sullen Bradley attempts to spell \"HELP\" in the sand but only manages \"HEPL.\"As Linda reminds him, \"We're not in the office anymore, Bradley.\"In both films, the protagonists feel so disillusioned with the existing systems of finding, keeping and succeeding at work that they believe their only hope is outside these systems. Man-su, of course, goes an extrajudicial route in his killings. Linda at one point hides from a rescue team, dreading a return to a society where the Bradleys of the world trod over the Lindas. She closes out \"Send Help\" with a bold, if dispiriting, piece of advice: \"No help is coming, so you better start saving yourself.\"Returning to real lifeIn the real world, workers and job seekers don't see outcomes as dramatic or decisive as Man-su and Linda get on-screen. But some are sticking it out in roles they're unhappy in or feeling like they're sending job applications into a black hole.\"There are major seismic shifts\" happening in the market and the world, Grandey says, \"that are pushing everyone to feel job insecure.\"The relatability of the protagonists' struggles \"allows us to feel more in control and empowered, because we can feel like them in that two-hour period,\" Grandey adds. \"And then we have to go back to our lives, but we carry a little bit of that empowerment with us.\"If you're experiencing a mental health crisis or concerning mental health symptoms, you can contact the free, confidential National Helpline for Mental Health at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown, in Washington on Oct. 27, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

    "body": "Signage outside the Chevron Corp. headquarters in Houston, Texas, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corp.The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share. It reported revenue of $49.73 billion in the quarter, down about 2% from the $50.67 billion in the year-ago period.Chevron's shares were trading more than 3% higher.Here is what Chevron reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.85 adjusted vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $49.73 billion vs. $49.01 billion expectedU.S. crude oil prices have fallen about 16% this year as OPEC+ increases production and President Donald Trump's tariffs have the market worried about an economic slowdown.Even with lower prices, Chevron pumped a record 4.1 million barrels per day, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year. Higher production came from the Hess acquisition, the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan, according to the company.Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.28 billion, down 34% compared with $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024. It pumped 2 million barrels per day, up 27% from 1.6 million bpd in year-ago period.International production recorded earnings of $2 billion, down 24% compared with $2.64 billion in the same quarter last year. Production increased 16% to 2 million bpd compared with 1.76 million bpd in the year-ago period.Profit increased more than 300% to $638 million in Chevron's downstream U.S. refining business, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2024. Refining profits increased year over year due to higher margins on product sales. International refining posted earnings of $499 million, up 11% from $449 million in the year-ago period.Capital expenditures increased 7% to $4.4 billion over the year-ago quarter because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Chevron's adjusted free cash flow rose about 50% to $7 billion over the year-ago period.Correction: Chevron reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared with $1.68 expected by an LSEG survey of Wall Street analysts. An earlier version misstated the estimate.",

    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split Thursday, a move that changes nothing fundamentally about the company, but could make the pricey individual shares more accessible to the retail investor.Existing shareholders as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the past one year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000.It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each a holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same.Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a \"B\" class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Netflix stock is up 42% for the past one year.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTech's internet giants have made it through earnings season, and they offered a consistent message to Wall Street: Artificial intelligence investments are only getting bigger.Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures and now collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.Microsoft's forecast was for fiscal 2026, which ends in June.The companies are racing to build out infrastructure for what they say is virtually limitless demand for AI services.Meanwhile, a growing number of skeptics are voicing concerns that these historic spending levels are fueling a bubble, and they're questioning whether there's sufficient energy and resources to ever turn lofty AI promises into reality.As big as the spending projections were this week, they look pedestrian when compared with OpenAI, which has announced roughly $1 trillion worth of infrastructure deals of late with partners including Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.Investor reactions to the megacap reports were mixed.Amazon saw its stock soar after the company beat on earnings and revenue, and said capex this year will be about $125 billion, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion.\"We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI,\" finance chief Brian Olsavsky said on the earnings call, adding that the number will grow in 2026. \"We believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term.\"watch nowInvestors also cheered Alphabet, which reported an earnings beat and boosted its capex forecast for this year to between $91 billion and $93 billion from a prior range of $75 billion to $85 billion. The stock rose 2.5% on Thursday.But Microsoft shares fell about 3% even though the software company's results exceeded estimates.CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that capex growth would accelerate in fiscal 2026, which started in July, after the company had previously said growth would slow. Capex rose 45% to $64.55 billion last fiscal year, suggesting a minimum of about $94 billion in 2026. That number is significantly higher when including leases.Meta's stock was hit harder, plummeting 11% on Thursday, its steepest drop in three years, despite an across-the-board beat. The company narrowed its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion, from a prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion.'Unknown revenue opportunity'Unlike Amazon, Microsoft and Google, Meta doesn't have a cloud service and lacks a clear revenue story that's tied to its AI investments.Meta says its benefits from AI come elsewhere, namely improved performance in its core digital ads business from better targeting.Still, analysts at Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, citing an \"unknown revenue opportunity\" in what the company is calling superintelligence, and said investors will struggle with \"aggressive revenue growth offset by high spending.\"Google, by contrast, has \"predictable earnings,\" the analysts wrote.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in June the creation of the company's Superintelligence Labs, and said it would be led by some of his company's costly high-profile hires, including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.The lab would house the company's various teams working on foundation models, Zuckerberg wrote in a memo at the time.\"I'm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone,\" Zuckerberg wrote.But the Oppenheimer analysts said it's an approach that \"mirrors\" the company's metaverse spending in 2021 and 2022, when Zuckerberg was declaring that platform to be the future of computing.Meta is still burning billions of dollars a quarter on its investments in augmented reality. The company said in its earnings report that its Reality Labs unit lost $4.4 billion in the quarter on $470 million in revenue.'No end in sight'Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesFor the other hyperscalers, investments in AI largely tie into their cloud infrastructure businesses, even as they're using AI companywide.Within cloud computing, Amazon Web Services is still bigger than Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, but it's growing more slowly than its rivals.AWS reported revenue growth in the third quarter of 20% to $33 billion. Microsoft said Azure revenue increased by 40%, while Google's cloud sales rose 34% to $15.15 billion.Analysts at Cantor said that clouds with \"expansive service stacks like Microsoft\" are in a position to benefit from this \"heightened phase of AI infrastructure build out.\"They recommend buying the stock, but see reasons to be worried about the spending forecast. The analysts said that total capex, which includes capital leases, is poised to reach $140 billion this year, up 58% from a year earlier and triple the figure from fiscal 2024.That number \"is reflective of strong demand on the positive side, but remains a concern as there appears no end in sight,\" the analysts wrote.WATCH: Meta capex doesn't necessarily result in ROIwatch nowRead more CNBC tech newsNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI is in a 'virtuous cycle.'

Brian Kaiser | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExxon Mobil is holding advanced talks with power providers and technology companies to cut the emissions of AI data centers that rely on natural gas by deploying carbon capture technology, CEO Darren Woods said Friday.\"I'm hopeful that many of these hyperscalers are sincere when they talk about the desire to have low emission facilities, because certainly in the near to medium term we're probably the only realistic game in town to accomplish that,\" Woods said on Exxon's earnings call.Hyperscalers refers to companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft that are building large data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications.Exxon aims to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by natural gas plants that power data centers, Woods said. The oil major is talking with power companies to decarbonize their plants, he said. \"We're pretty advanced in the conversations,\" the CEO said.The tech sector has mostly secured renewable energy to offset the emissions from their data centers, though they are now making major investments in nuclear power as well.Some companies are turning to natural gas as well as they search for reliable power. Meta, for example, signed an agreement with the utility Entergy in Louisiana to power a data center campus with natural gas.\"We secured locations. We've got the existing infrastructure, certainly have the know-how in terms of the technology of capturing, transporting and storing [carbon dioxide],\" Woods said.",

But other long-term investors have purchased I bonds over the past couple of years to lock in the higher fixed rate.How I bond rates workI bond rates have a variable and fixed portion, which the Treasury adjusts every six months, in May and November. The combined yield is known as the \"composite rate,\" which is paid to investors for a six-month period.   The variable rate is tied to inflation, and stays the same for six months after your purchase date, regardless of the Treasury's next adjustment. Meanwhile, the fixed rate stays the same for the life of your I bond after purchase. The fixed portion can be harder to predict, and the Treasury doesn't disclose how it calculates the change.watch nowHow the change impacts current I bond investorsIf you currently own I bonds, there's a six-month timeline for rate changes, which shifts depending on your original purchase date.After the first six months, the variable yield changes to the next announced rate. But the fixed rate stays the same for the entirety of your holding.For example, let's say you purchased I bonds in March. Your variable rate would be 1.90% and shifts to 2.86% in September. Your fixed rate remains at 1.2%. At that point, your new composite rate would be 4.06%.You can earn I bond interest for up to 30 years, or less if you redeem the assets before that. However, you can't cash in I bonds for at least one year after purchase. If you redeem within five years, you lose your last three months of interest.",

    "body": "Amid high-profile job cuts at major companies like Meta, Amazon and Target, many workers are undoubtedly anxious about future downsizing.According to Jason Walker and Rey Ramirez, co-founders of Thrive HR Consulting, a significant portion of these recent job cuts can be credited to AI.\"Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they're taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,\" Walker says.Another reason could be that toward the end of the year, companies \"start to look at head count, they start to look at cost, and there's just general trimming of employees based upon that,\" he says.From an employee's perspective, these job cuts may feel sudden, but there are a few signs workers should pay attention to that could indicate a coming layoff, according to Walker, Ramirez and other experts.Hiring and spending slow downAccording to Jalonni Weaver, a high-volume recruiter based in Dallas, the number one portent of an upcoming layoff is a \"slowdown in hiring.\" It's a red flag when a company stops posting new roles, or when roles remain open for months, Weaver says.That may signal that the company could be in financial trouble — and for Weaver, a decrease in recruiting work meant that her own job was in jeopardy.A hiring freeze doesn't necessarily mean that layoffs are imminent, but \"it's never a good sign that you're doing well financially,\" Walker says.Similarly, she advises workers to keep an eye out for sharp decreases in company spending. When a company is having money troubles, perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables \"go away\" she says, and year-end bonuses could shrink or vanish entirely.With these changes, \"the culture usually shifts,\" Weaver says, and \"nobody's really happy.\"Corporate messaging changesPay attention to what leaders are saying about the future of the business, Ramirez says.Phrases like \"We need to be more efficient\" are potential red flags that the company is looking to cut headcount, according to Ramirez.When a company begins to emphasize operations over innovation, \"that's usually a sign that change is coming, and that people will be impacted,\" according to Rosie Nestingen, an organizational transformation consultant.\"If one quarter you're focused on innovation and impact, and then the next quarter on 'buckling down,'\" that could be a sign of impending layoffs, she says.\"There's a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,\" she continues.People trickle outThe last major sign of impending layoffs is \"quiet firing,\" Weaver says, which she defines as companies \"finding ways to push people out, regardless of their performance,\" without conducting formal layoffs.For example, hourly employees may find that their typical weekly hours have been cut in half, Ramirez says.\"Employees can't afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,\" he says.RTO mandates can be used as another method to reduce headcount, according to Walker: after working remotely for years, studies show that many employees would rather look for another job than return to the office.If co-workers and higher-ups start leaving the company of their own accord, it might be a good idea to follow their example, Weaver says.They may be aware that the company isn't doing well, or they could be stifled by a lack of growth opportunities.How employees can prepareIf you notice red flags that could indicate impending layoffs, \"don't just ignore it or think 'it'll never happen to me,'\" Weaver says.Her biggest piece of advice for employees is to \"always keep your resume up to date,\" she says.Staying abreast of market trends is key, according to Weaver. She advises workers to peruse job descriptions for similar roles and pay attention to which skills are on the rise.Weaver recommends asking yourself, \"What has changed, what are they looking for in newer people, and how can I get that experience in my current role?\"She also suggests that employees periodically apply to other roles, \"even if you are happy at your job,\" to make sure that their resumes remain competitive.Walker has similar advice. \"Your resume should be ready to go,\" he says. \"It should look the best it's ever looked, and if you're getting an inkling of the fact that you think you're going to go, start sending it out in advance, start sending it out right away.\"In today's job market, \"you're not going to be successful with the traditional methods,\" Walker says.Instead of just sending over an application, Walker recommends connecting directly with the hiring manager for the roles you want.\"The ability to get in front of people more personally is really important right now,\" he says.Above all, don't get complacent at your job, Weaver says: \"It's okay to love where you work, but don't get too comfortable to where you miss signs that things are going on.\"\"At the end of the day, businesses are going to do what they need to do for themselves,\" she continues.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) speaks during a press conference on healthcare with other House Democrats, on the East steps of the U.S. Capitol on the 15th day of the government shutdown in Washington, DC on October 15, 2025. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesAmericans will experience sticker shock this health insurance open enrollment season, with higher premiums for individuals and families, and for small business owners and their workers on Main Streets across the U.S., there's little relief. While small business advocates are seeking Congressional assistance, the prospects for support are hazy, at best. After payroll, healthcare is the biggest expense for small businesses, and increases in healthcare costs tend to hit smaller companies especially hard. As an example, family premiums for small firms have risen steadily over the past two decades. They're up more than 350% from 1999, according to data from KFF, which was formerly known as The Kaiser Family Foundation.  To be sure, premiums are also up for large firms, but smaller companies generally feel the pinch more acutely. For firms with 10 to 199 workers, the average family premium climbed to $26,054 in 2025 from $16,977 in 2020, according to a recent KFF report.Health care consistently ranks in the top three as the issue that \"matters the most\" to small business owners, according to the CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. Immigration and health care are in a virtual tie in the No. 2 and No. 3 positions, only topped by \"jobs and the economy.\"\"Any increase is challenging for small businesses because most small firms are already operating on thin margins,\" John Arensmeyer, founder and chief executive of Small Business Majority, a business advocacy organization, wrote in an email.Government shutdown and ACA tax creditsThe government's month-long shutdown doesn't instill much confidence about lawmakers' ability to push through major health care reform. Still, certain aspects of health care reform are under discussion, including whether to extend enhanced premium tax credits, designed to make healthcare more affordable through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. These credits are set to expire this year.These credits were introduced in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act. The enhanced tax credits boosted the level of financial assistance available to eligible ACA marketplace enrollees. Middle-income enrollees with income above 400% of federal poverty guidelines also became eligible for premium tax credits.\"Since the introduction of the enhanced premium tax credits, enrollment in the ACA marketplace has more than doubled from about 11 to over 24 million people, the vast majority of whom receive an enhanced premium tax credit,\" according to KFF. If these credits expire, many marketplace enrollees will continue to qualify for a smaller tax credit, while others will lose eligibility. These enrollees would be hit by a \"double whammy,\" according to KFF. They'd lose their entire tax credit and be responsible for rising premiums.Half of all marketplace enrollees are small business owners, self-employed entrepreneurs or small business employees, according to Arensmeyer. \"On the individual market, data shows that those who purchase their healthcare through the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see an average increase of 75% if the enhanced premium tax credits are not renewed,\" he wrote.watch nowA handful of deals to extend the enhanced premium tax credits have already been rejected and with the ongoing government shutdown it's hard to say how things will shake out. Broadly speaking, Democrats would like to see the temporary cuts renewed and are concerned about the sticker shock when the credits expire, while Republicans, generally, worry about the cost — they believe they help people too high on the income scale, and claim the marketplace is rife with \"fraud.\" One notable exception is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.) who has expressed frustration over the lack of a Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act and the tax subsidy issue.Small businesses, meanwhile, are caught in the crosswinds. A survey of 620 small business owners by Small Business for America's Future, an advocacy group, found that 84% of respondents are concerned about their ability to afford healthcare in 2026 if the tax credits expire at year-end. According to the survey, nearly 40% said premium increases will create severe financial strain and threaten their operations. Close to a quarter said they'll be forced to drop employee coverage. Small businesses are lobbying CongressSmall businesses are calling on Congress to support health care reform in other ways. In October, NFIB, a nonprofit organization that advocates for small businesses, sent a letter to Congress supporting the CHOICE Arrangement Act. The bill writes health reimbursement accounts into the tax code, giving small businesses more affordable and flexible health insurance options, according to NFIB. It also provides an exemption for small businesses to allow pre-tax funds to pay for employee health care.\"The average cost of a healthcare premium for small business owners has risen over 120% since 2000,\" wrote Tyler Dever, NFIB principal of federal government relations. \"This significant increase has forced small businesses to make difficult choices, including limiting or eliminating health benefits to their employees. This is not an outcome small business owners desire, as it can put entrepreneurs at a disadvantage when they are competing against larger companies to fill jobs.\" The bill was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means in September. A version of the bill has also been referred to the Senate Finance Committee.Separately, President Trump recently suggested that Democrats and Republicans should join forces on finding an alternative to the Affordable Care Act that became law during President Obama's administration. \"We have to fix health care, because Obamacare is a disaster,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One en route to South Korea, according to a report from The Hill. Even so, NSBA, a small business advocacy organization, doesn't see a huge appetite for significant healthcare reform in Congress. \"It's not at the top of lawmakers' list,\" a spokesperson said. Small business cutbacks to worker health benefitsAmid rising health-care costs, some small businesses have had to pare back. Small Business Majority's research has found that small businesses are making some changes that include increased employee contributions to their health plans, moving to an insurance plan offering more limited coverage and cutting other employee benefits. \"The consequence is that as small businesses reduce their benefit offerings, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to compete with larger corporations for top talent,\" Arensmeyer wrote. \"As a result, access to quality, affordable health insurance isn't just a cost issue for small businesses—it's a labor issue as well.\"There's not a lot small businesses can do to keep costs at bay, other than shop around or reconsider some of the benefits offered to workers. Still, Matthew Rae, associate director of the Program on the Health Care Marketplace at KFF, encourages small businesses to look around for potential opportunities to save. \"Ask questions to your vendors and insurers to make sure you're getting a plan that's appropriate to your population,\" he said. \"You can get creative about some of the offerings so you can better manage the cost of the plans.\"GLP-1 weight loss drug pharmacy costsPharmacy prices are a large driver of rising costs, according to HUB International's 2026 Benefits Cost Trend report, with high-cost prescription drugs, such as GLP-1s, a major contributor.More than 57 million privately insured adults may qualify for GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro, according to KFF, and employer coverage of GLP-1 drugs is expanding. A notable 55% of employers cover GLP-1s for diabetes, and 36% cover them for both diabetes and weight loss, according to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.While coverage for GLP-1 prescriptions is much more common among large employers than small businesses, recent KFF surveying of the employer market (it did not study firms with less than 200 employees) indicates that many are considering cutbacks in this coverage given the costs, despite widespread acknowledgment of the health benefits.",

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Affected networks include ESPN and its sister sports networks, ABC, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to all Disney employees Friday, noting that YouTube TV also \"deleted all [Disney] previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers' libraries\" in addition to failing to strike a deal.\"Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,\" wrote Walden, Bergman and Pitaro. \"Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\"The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET. YouTube TV subscribers risk losing access to college football if a deal isn't struck by Saturday morning and \"Monday Night Football\" if programming isn't returned by the start of next week.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC. Disney has no interest in adding its streaming services to YouTube Primetime Channels, the people said.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season.President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year.While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower.\"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\"Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins.Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August.These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate.For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest.Impact at the cash registerIn real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher.\"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\"The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs.\"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said.Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources.LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025.\"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\"Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "Darren Woods, chairman and chief executive officer Exxon Mobil Corp., speaks during a panel discussion at the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, on July 15, 2025. Brian Kaiser | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExxon Mobil is holding advanced talks with power providers and technology companies to cut the emissions of AI data centers that rely on natural gas by deploying carbon capture technology, CEO Darren Woods said Friday.\"I'm hopeful that many of these hyperscalers are sincere when they talk about the desire to have low emission facilities, because certainly in the near to medium term we're probably the only realistic game in town to accomplish that,\" Woods said on Exxon's earnings call.Hyperscalers refers to companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft that are building large data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications.Exxon aims to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by natural gas plants that power data centers, Woods said. The oil major is talking with power companies to decarbonize their plants, he said. \"We're pretty advanced in the conversations,\" the CEO said.The tech sector has mostly secured renewable energy to offset the emissions from their data centers, though they are now making major investments in nuclear power as well.Some companies are turning to natural gas as well as they search for reliable power. Meta, for example, signed an agreement with the utility Entergy in Louisiana to power a data center campus with natural gas.\"We secured locations. We've got the existing infrastructure, certainly have the know-how in terms of the technology of capturing, transporting and storing [carbon dioxide],\" Woods said.",

    "body": "Desmond Lim, co-founder and CEO of Workstream.Courtesy of Desmond LimIt's often said that \"there's no such thing as balance\" in entrepreneurship, but startup founder Desmond Lim disagrees.The CEO and co-founder of Workstream, a HR, payroll and hiring platform for hourly workers, says that balance isn't just possible — it's also necessary.Running a company can be very taxing, said Lim, who works about 11 hours a day on average.Not only are the hours long, but it can also be mentally consuming. \"The emotional ups and downs are always very challenging ... The highs are very high, the lows are very low,\" said Lim.\"Every year, you still think the company could die. And then I just try to remind myself ... you are still alive, healthy, everything is good,\" he said. \"And the other thing is, you cannot stop thinking about work. I dream about it.\"That's why Lim believes it's crucial for entrepreneurs to protect their health and energy. His strategy? Sticking to a fixed daily schedule that works best for his body and brain. \"My advice is, find your own rhythm,\" the 39-year-old said.I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning. For me, it's sports.Desmond LimCo-founder and CEO, WorkstreamMixing two kinds of schedulesLim follows what he calls a \"dual schedule,\" inspired by an essay by Paul Graham, the co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator.Graham's essay breaks down two types of time management: a manager's schedule — typically packed with back-to-back, hour-long meetings — and a maker's schedule, designed for creators like programmers or writers who thrive working in long, uninterrupted stretches to focus and build.\"I actually like to have my schedule mixed ... I like to have calls, deep work, calls, deep work,\" said Lim. Rather than sticking strictly to one style, Lim said he thrives by mixing both and following his own rhythm.Here's what Lim's weekday typically looks like:6:30 a.m.: Wake up7:00 a.m.to 8:30 a.m.: Exercise or sports8:30 a.m.to 9:30 a.m.: Protein shake and get ready for work9:30 a.m.: Arrive at work9:30 a.m.to 10:30 a.m.: Plan out the day and clear some to-do items10:30 a.m.to 12:30 p.m.: Meetings12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.: Lunch with team1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.: More meetings2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.: Deep work5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.: More meetings (sometimes with people in Asia)7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.: Finish up last tasks and work8:30 p.m.: Leave officeOn weekends, Lim says he locks away his work phone in a cupboard and focuses on spending time with family.Going deep on personal passionsAlong with saving weekends for family time, Lim also prioritizes his passion for sports and exercise by building it into his daily schedule.\"One advice [I have] for founders and leaders is ... to go very deep on one passion you have that is not work [related],\" said Lim. \"For me, that has been sports ... I do a lot of basketball, swimming, and gym. I think having a balance other than work has been very helpful for me.\"CEO of Workstream Desmond Lim has been playing basketball since he was seven-years-old.Courtesy of Desmond Lim.Lim developed his love for basketball when he was seven. He went on to captain his school teams from middle school to university, and even played professionally for the Singapore National Youth Team.These days, he still starts each morning with 75 to 90 minutes of exercise —calisthenics, gym training or basketball — often with a friend to keep him accountable.\"I really believe in being able to move well ... [especially] as you grow old,\" he said. \"I try to get the non-negotiables out [of the way] in the early morning.

    "body": "Man and woman having a small business meeting in smart casual clothesIppei Naoi | Moment | Getty ImagesOne successful angel investor has revealed two red flags that prevent him from investing in a founder in the first meeting.Carles Reina is an angel investor who backed voice cloning AI startup Eleven Labs when it was still in its very early stages in 2022. The firm was co-founded by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, and raised $180 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion, in its Series C funding earlier this year.In September, the company announced it was letting employees sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation. Reina is now a vice president of revenue at the AI firm.When Reina first met Eleven Lab's co-founder Staniszewski, he told CNBC Make It that nobody wanted to invest in voice AI at the time. However, Reina decided to take a chance on Eleven Labs after just one meeting.\"We started talking, and within 30 minutes of the first conversation, I told him, 'How much money do you want?'\" Reina shared.He explained that the first meeting is critical when making a decision and Staniszewski displayed certain traits that attracted him as an investor.\"If the first signs are just not there, I usually don't want to waste anyone's time… I think you end up optimizing always for high quality interactions, [it's] like you're trying to triage if this is something that you really like and that you want to spend more time with the founders or not.\"Reina opened up about two reasons why he wouldn't want to invest in a founder after a first meeting.Two red flagsOne of the key traits that Reina looks for when meeting a founder is technicality.\"This is very personal, especially in different stages. But for me, if one of the founders is not technical, like literally cannot build products, is not a researcher or something like that, I just don't see the value in that because they're not going to be able to move as quickly,\" he said in the interview.Reina saw this quality in Eleven Lab's Staniszewski, who has a first-class honors degree in mathematics from Imperial College London.\"It was really interesting to see he was thinking about the problems of the entire ecosystem before even actually having any product, or before even actually talking to any real potential customer,\" he said.The second red flag is if the founder is trying to build a company in a \"very crowded market\" which Reina often tries to steer clear of.\"if there is a lot of venture capitalists looking at that market, because it is sexy, I'm just not interested because then valuations skyrocket and you end up going into a pricing war where everyone's trying to give them term sheets and so on,\" he said.When too many VCs want to invest in a company, it inflates the valuation of that company which then puts unnecessary pressure on the founders to show rapid growth and maintain or increase that valuation, according to Reina.Other reasons might be that the founder is in an industry he just isn't interested in and it doesn't fit his profile of investments.\"If someone sends me a pitch, or I get introduced to someone that just doesn't really bring my attention straight away, I will tell them straight away 'happy to help you on anything that you need [but] from an angel perspective or investing perspective, it's just not one of my things.'\"",

    "body": "Amid high-profile job cuts at major companies like Meta, Amazon and Target, many workers are undoubtedly anxious about future downsizing.According to Jason Walker and Rey Ramirez, co-founders of Thrive HR Consulting, a significant portion of these recent job cuts can be credited to AI.\"Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they're taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,\" Walker says.Another reason could be that toward the end of the year, companies \"start to look at head count, they start to look at cost, and there's just general trimming of employees based upon that,\" he says.From an employee's perspective, these job cuts may feel sudden, but there are a few signs workers should pay attention to that could indicate a coming layoff, according to Walker, Ramirez and other experts.Hiring and spending slow downAccording to Jalonni Weaver, a high-volume recruiter based in Dallas, the number one portent of an upcoming layoff is a \"slowdown in hiring.\" It's a red flag when a company stops posting new roles, or when roles remain open for months, Weaver says.That may signal that the company could be in financial trouble — and for Weaver, a decrease in recruiting work meant that her own job was in jeopardy.A hiring freeze doesn't necessarily mean that layoffs are imminent, but \"it's never a good sign that you're doing well financially,\" Walker says.Similarly, she advises workers to keep an eye out for sharp decreases in company spending. When a company is having money troubles, perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables \"go away\" she says, and year-end bonuses could shrink or vanish entirely.With these changes, \"the culture usually shifts,\" Weaver says, and \"nobody's really happy.\"Corporate messaging changesPay attention to what leaders are saying about the future of the business, Ramirez says.Phrases like \"We need to be more efficient\" are potential red flags that the company is looking to cut headcount, according to Ramirez.When a company begins to emphasize operations over innovation, \"that's usually a sign that change is coming, and that people will be impacted,\" according to Rosie Nestingen, an organizational transformation consultant.\"If one quarter you're focused on innovation and impact, and then the next quarter on 'buckling down,'\" that could be a sign of impending layoffs, she says.\"There's a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,\" she continues.People trickle outThe last major sign of impending layoffs is \"quiet firing,\" Weaver says, which she defines as companies \"finding ways to push people out, regardless of their performance,\" without conducting formal layoffs.For example, hourly employees may find that their typical weekly hours have been cut in half, Ramirez says.\"Employees can't afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,\" he says.RTO mandates can be used as another method to reduce headcount, according to Walker: after working remotely for years, studies show that many employees would rather look for another job than return to the office.If co-workers and higher-ups start leaving the company of their own accord, it might be a good idea to follow their example, Weaver says.They may be aware that the company isn't doing well, or they could be stifled by a lack of growth opportunities.How employees can prepareIf you notice red flags that could indicate impending layoffs, \"don't just ignore it or think 'it'll never happen to me,'\" Weaver says.Her biggest piece of advice for employees is to \"always keep your resume up to date,\" she says.Staying abreast of market trends is key, according to Weaver. She advises workers to peruse job descriptions for similar roles and pay attention to which skills are on the rise.Weaver recommends asking yourself, \"What has changed, what are they looking for in newer people, and how can I get that experience in my current role?\"She also suggests that employees periodically apply to other roles, \"even if you are happy at your job,\" to make sure that their resumes remain competitive.Walker has similar advice. \"Your resume should be ready to go,\" he says. \"It should look the best it's ever looked, and if you're getting an inkling of the fact that you think you're going to go, start sending it out in advance, start sending it out right away.\"In today's job market, \"you're not going to be successful with the traditional methods,\" Walker says.Instead of just sending over an application, Walker recommends connecting directly with the hiring manager for the roles you want.\"The ability to get in front of people more personally is really important right now,\" he says.Above all, don't get complacent at your job, Weaver says: \"It's okay to love where you work, but don't get too comfortable to where you miss signs that things are going on.\"\"At the end of the day, businesses are going to do what they need to do for themselves,\" she continues.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

But other long-term investors have purchased I bonds over the past couple of years to lock in the higher fixed rate.How I bond rates workI bond rates have a variable and fixed portion, which the Treasury adjusts every six months, in May and November. The combined yield is known as the \"composite rate,\" which is paid to investors for a six-month period.   The variable rate is tied to inflation, and stays the same for six months after your purchase date, regardless of the Treasury's next adjustment. Meanwhile, the fixed rate stays the same for the life of your I bond after purchase. The fixed portion can be harder to predict, and the Treasury doesn't disclose how it calculates the change.watch nowHow the change impacts current I bond investorsIf you currently own I bonds, there's a six-month timeline for rate changes, which shifts depending on your original purchase date.After the first six months, the variable yield changes to the next announced rate. But the fixed rate stays the same for the entirety of your holding.For example, let's say you purchased I bonds in March. Your variable rate would be 1.90% and shifts to 2.86% in September. Your fixed rate remains at 1.2%. At that point, your new composite rate would be 4.06%.You can earn I bond interest for up to 30 years, or less if you redeem the assets before that. However, you can't cash in I bonds for at least one year after purchase. If you redeem within five years, you lose your last three months of interest.",

Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season.President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year.While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower.\"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\"Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins.Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August.These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate.For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest.Impact at the cash registerIn real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher.\"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\"The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs.\"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said.Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources.LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025.\"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\"Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.",

    "body": "META CEO Mark Zuckerberg (L) and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Getty ImagesAs tech giants increase their already breathtaking spending on artificial intelligence, their respective digital advertising businesses have also gained momentum.Quarterly earnings reports this week from Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all showed healthy revenue on the ads front.The rising online advertising sales have allayed concerns earlier this year that economic turbulence, amplified by President Donald Trump's trade policies, would negatively impact ad budgets.  \"I think the digital ad market is strong,\" said Jasmine Enberg, co-founder of Scalable, a creator economy media firm. \"I think this economic instability and volatility is kind of priced in for a lot of people at this point; sort of seems to be the status quo.\"Meta topped its rivals for the quarter with the fastest ad-related sales growth.The company's total third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, jumped 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, the company's highest sales since the first quarter of 2024.Revenue in Amazon's online ad unit soared 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, representing a faster growth rate than the company's AWS cloud computing unit, which saw sales rise 20%.CEO Andy Jassy highlighted on Amazon's earnings call that the company is continuing to expand its ad-specific demand-side platform to more third-party apps and sites.\"You look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S.,\" Jassy said. \"And you layer on top of that what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful.\"Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during an unveiling event in New York, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAlphabet's overall advertising sales for the third quarter came in at $74.18 billion, a 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. Third-quarter online ad sales for YouTube rose 15% to $10.26 billion.Microsoft's search and news advertising unit brought in $3.7 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter, a 14% increase from the $3.2 billion it recorded the previous year.Even if there's been some pullback in ad budgets due to economic uncertainty, it's likely that companies shifted some of that spending from traditional businesses like newspapers to digital ad platforms, said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of content at Emarketer.  \"I think what could be happening is more of a no-brainer,\" Goldman said. \"To put your money in social, and to put your money in retail media and to put your money in search ad spending.\"It wasn't just the megacaps that showed hefty online ad growth this week. Reddit on Thursday reported a 68% jump in third-quarter sales, soaring past analyst estimates. The company said global daily active uniques grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing estimates of 114 million.Snap and Pinterest are scheduled to report results next week. Going big on AIThe tech giants all made clear that they don't see any broader economic concerns that would warrant a reduction in their AI spending, and instead lifted their guidance for capital expenditures, despite concerns of a bubble.Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft collectively expect capex spending above $380 billion this year, which is still a fraction of the $1 trillion worth of data center and cloud computing deals that OpenAI has recently announced with its partners like Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.But while investors cheered Amazon and Google, they were less thrilled with Microsoft, and especially Meta.The Facebook parent's stock tanked 11% on Thursday after the company said it would raise the low end of its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion from the prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion.Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Meta stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, because they said it's less obvious how the social media company will benefit from its AI investments relative to its big tech rivals that also operate cloud computing services.\"Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending,\" the Oppenheimer analysts wrote, contrasting the company's big AI spending related to its Superintelligence Labs to its money-losing Reality Labs division, which makes virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.watch nowSusan Li, Meta's finance chief, said Wednesday during a follow-up earnings call that it's important for the company to invest in AI-related data center and third-party cloud computing services or risk falling behind, echoing similar comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"The highest priority for the company is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI,\" Li said. \"That means that I think for the immediate period of time ahead of us, we could see some financial pressure during which our operating profit could be lumpy.\"Meta has continued to point to how its AI investments are improving its online advertising business, but it's having a more difficult time showing how that spending will benefit the company in the future, Enberg said.\"I think part of that is that we've heard the story now quarter after quarter that it is able to integrate AI into its ad business and use that as a growth engine,\" Enberg said.  \"What comes next is harder to articulate, and far less tangible for investors and other people who follow the space.\"Still, Meta is experiencing some growth in new products like the Meta AI app that contains the Vibes AI-powered short video service, Goldman said.The company can also still expand more into subscriptions or even potentially offer enterprise AI services to sell to corporations, which is \"an area that they haven't played at all,\" he said.For now, Meta's digital advertising unit remains its core business, and just like previous quarters, it's unclear how the economy will impact ad budgets.With the holiday season approaching, all eyes will be focused on whether the lingering economic concerns or tariff-related price hikes lead to consumers curbing their spending, which could impact corporate marketing campaigns.  \"The next test will be when we get to the Black Friday numbers,\" Goldman said. \"Are those going to be below expectations?\"WATCH: Big tech earnings tell you \"these are the companies you want to own.\" watch now",

(Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSince Russia found itself cast out of the Western cultural and sporting sphere following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has tried in earnest to create something of a \"parallel world\" of events and institutions that could act as substitutes.After launching the war against its neighbor in 2022, Russia was banned from participating in the Olympic Games, a competition in which it had traditionally fared well, although its success was often accompanied by various doping scandals. It was also barred from more light-hearted cultural events, such as the Eurovision Song Contest.Russia has sought to turn its banishment to its advantage, however, looking to replace such events with home-grown versions.While Russians understand that such substitutes are not the genuine articles, many have seen efforts to recreate sporting and cultural events as a patriotic effort to rekindle Russia's Soviet-era, which Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently references with nostalgia.\"The majority of Russians believe that Russia was unfairly excluded from most of the international events, so these substitutes make sense in terms of providing some alternative,\" according to Anton Barbashin, a Russian political analyst and editorial director of the journal Riddle, told CNBC Thursday.\"[They have a kind of attitude that they're] 'better than nothing' but of course only a minority of people would treat them as a real deal. For the older generation, it is a reminder of Soviet-organized events. Often Putin is framing them in this way as well — as a revival of old traditions,\" Barbashin said by email.Barbashin characterized Russia's strategy of \"import-substitution\" as one that was done out of \"pure necessity.\"Soviet revival?The Kremlin has frequently described its isolation from the West as \"Russophobic\" and sought to position itself as the victim of Western hegemony, while calling for a new \"global order.\"The war in Ukraine has certainly led to Russia to look beyond the West to foster economic and cultural ties, with varying degrees of success.Russia said in May 2023 that it was going to create an alternative to the Olympic Games known as the \"World Friendship Games\" but it announced in late 2024 that it was postponing the event indefinitely, without providing a reason.The postponement came after heavy criticism from the International Olympic Committee, which said the games were a \"cynical attempt\" to politicize sport and urged athletes to boycott the event.An event that ostensibly had more success was Russia's relaunch, this September, of the Soviet-era Intervision Song Contest. An alternative to the popular European event Eurovision, Russia said its version of the contest would foster cultural ties between countries that were outside the West.There was some bemusement over the contest among commentators, and critics said it was a propaganda tool, but the competition attracted singers from 23 countries (notably, the U.S.' original entrant pulled out of the contest at the last minute) and the competition was won by Vietnam's Duc Phuc.Russia's President Vladimir Putin's image is displayed on a screen of the main stage of the Intervision Song Contest at the Live Arena in Moscow on September 20, 2025.           Olesya Kurpyayeva | Afp | Getty ImagesSuch events were not intended to try to replace international ones that Russia can no longer participate in, one Russian analyst said, but were meant to be alternatives.\"It is true that [Russian substitute events] cannot replace genuine international events, nor is that its purpose, but it is supposed to create alternative platforms — a space where Russia can operate and develop something that is 'friendly' yet still international,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst and founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNBC Thursday.\"It is based on the idea of Western decline and the enforcement of multipolarity. Domestically, it carries significant meaning in terms of managing resources, political dividends, and visibility,\" Stanovaya said.Does Russia want back in?The war in Ukraine is ongoing, with little sign that Russia wants to re-engage with the West, particularly when it comes to Kyiv, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's calls for a ceasefire and for Moscow to come to the negotiating table.The Kremlin has said it wants peace but has demanded that Ukraine cede partially Russian-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine to Russia, which Kyiv refuses to do.Despite the ongoing war, and anti-Western rhetoric that has become embedded in Kremlin and state media commentary, Russia is likely to be ready and willing to participate in future global cultural and sporting events should circumstances change.Russian President Vladimir Putin passes symbolic FIFA World Cup Baton to Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani (not pictured) during the ceremony at the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, July,15,2018.

The FIFA World Cup 2018 [hosted by Russia] was the highest moment in Russian history for that,\" Barbashin said, adding that \"it matters greatly for the people.\"Asked if Russia would, once the war in Ukraine ends, like to participate once again in global events, Barbashin was emphatic:\"Absolutely, [at the] first chance Russia has. Russia's entire conversation has always been, and is with, the West. The swing back to it is inevitable,\" he said.",

    "body": "A customer shops for Halloween candy at a Walmart Supercenter on October 16, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe scariest thing haunting Halloween this year isn't a ghost, goblin or ghoul — it's the price of chocolate.From Snickers to Reese's to Twix, one of America's favorite indulgences is getting more expensive, as tariffs, inflation and high cocoa prices squeeze profit margins and customers' pocketbooks, possibly leading to fewer chocolate bars landing in trick-or-treat buckets this year.Chocolate prices have surged nearly 30% since last Halloween and almost 78% in the past five years, according to data from research firm Circana and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 100-piece variety bag of candy now costs $16.39, up from $7.20 in 2020, FinanceBuzz found.That spike is showing up on store shelves. Variety packs from Hershey — maker of Reese's, KitKats and Heath bars — are up about 22%, while Mars, the company behind M&M's and Milky Way, raised prices about 12%, according to the Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank, and the Groundwork Collaborative.\"The season did get off to a slow start,\" Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner told investors on an earnings call Thursday, warning that holiday sales could be softer this year.About 4 in 5 Americans buy candy for the Halloween holiday, according to YouGov. This time of year makes up about 18% of annual U.S. confectionery sales — second only to Christmas, according to the National Confectioners Association.But chocolate's dominance is slipping. Circana found it made up 52% of Halloween candy sales last year, compared with 44% this year, as shoppers shift toward cheaper, trendier sweets.\"Macroeconomic headwinds\" are among the culprits, said Sally Wyatt, who works for Circana analyzing global consumer packaged goods and as a food-service industry advisor. \"It's the compounded impact on top of the fact that we've outpaced wage growth. So consumers have started to ... [make] very specific choices on discretionary items.\"Sector-wide, candy prices are outpacing the national inflation rate, marking a roughly 10% increase compared with last year, according to the Century Foundation. Still, the National Retail Federation said 2025 is expected to be a record year for candy sales in the U.S., with about $3.9 billion spent on Halloween candy alone.\"Even as consumers face higher prices for food, they continue to leave room in their budgets for chocolate and candy, meaning that the category is strong, vibrant and growing,\" Carly Schildhaus, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, told CNBC.Much of the chocolate filling U.S. shelves this fall was made from cocoa beans purchased at record prices last December, when futures peaked above $12,000 per ton, experts said. Prices have since cooled to around $6,000, but that's still more than double the pre-pandemic average.A cocktail of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, drought and crop disease for the past three years has devastated harvests in West Africa, which produces roughly 70% of the world's cocoa. The result: the largest global cocoa deficit in 60 years, with supply falling half a million tons short of demand.Prices could stabilize, but not decrease, by next year as crop yields have increased, said David Branch, a sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"It's not just the cost of manufacturing cocoa and other ingredients,\" Branch told CNBC. \"It's also a combination of labor, transportation, fuel, overhead [and] all of those factors, and, given the inflationary rate we've been in, those came up and haven't really come down.\"Hershey said Thursday that tariff expenses will cost the company $160 million to $170 million this year. In July, it also announced a \"low double-digit\" price hike, though executives said those increases weren't tied to tariffs or Halloween pricing.Chocolate makers have lobbied the Trump administration for tariff exemptions on cocoa and other agricultural imports, arguing they have little ability to source those ingredients domestically.Sweet varietyAs chocolate becomes more expensive, fruity, sour and chewy candies have gotten more popular. More than half of shoppers said they planned to prioritize gummy candies for Halloween this year, NielsenIQ found.On average, the price per pound of chocolate rose nearly 14% in the 12 weeks ending Oct. 5, while sales volumes fell 6%, Circana data show. Non-chocolate Halloween candy such as Jolly Ranchers and Skittles saw sales climb 8.3% in that same period.Younger adults, especially Gen Z, are also fueling growth in non-chocolate categories — gravitating toward gummies, freeze-dried sweets and TikTok-friendly flavor mashups.\"It's that experiential [aspect] because you can have it [non-chocolate items] with chewy, with sweet flavors, with hot and sweet, spicy flavors,\" Wyatt told CNBC. \"Some candies you get this big explosion in your mouth of flavors. We've seen it popular with different cohorts.\"Chocolate makers are responding in kind. Hershey has expanded its gummy lineup, including a partnership with Shaquille O'Neal, and rolled out ghost-shaped Twizzlers and mismatched \"Trickies\" Jolly Rancher gummies.Mondelez International, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone, said it's also prioritizing gummies in the U.S. market. CEO Dirk Van de Put said on an earnings call Tuesday, however, that the U.S. market in particular \"is slower than we've seen in quite a while\" and the company's promotional strategy earlier this year \"was not giving us the volume effect that we were hoping for.\"Manufacturers are also experimenting with smaller bars, new fillings and cocoa-free options such as crème or nut-based confections to offset rising ingredient costs, Branch said.\"Companies have got to be very aware of if they can keep their prices in line. They can't just keep increasing their prices and expect sales to continue to go up,\" Branch said. \"But customers have not lost their appetite for chocolate. It's going to remain an indulgence that people will always have and can't really do without.\"",

Earnings per share totaled 80 cents, surpassing an estimate of 51 cents.Reddit also released a better-than-expected sales outlook for the fourth quarter. The company projects between $655 million and $665 million, topping the $638 million forecast from Wall Street.These results \"speak to the company's continued progress across its ad and platform initiatives,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. \"We see a long runway for growth across both active advertisers (+75% y/y in 3Q) as well as greater penetration within existing advertisers.\"Reddit said that nine of its top 15 advertiser verticals grew more than 50%.

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Affected networks include ESPN and its sister sports networks, ABC, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to all Disney employees Friday, noting that YouTube TV also \"deleted all [Disney] previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers' libraries\" in addition to failing to strike a deal.\"Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,\" wrote Walden, Bergman and Pitaro. \"Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\"The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET. YouTube TV subscribers risk losing access to college football if a deal isn't struck by Saturday morning and \"Monday Night Football\" if programming isn't returned by the start of next week.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC. Disney has no interest in adding its streaming services to YouTube Primetime Channels, the people said.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The agreement with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call Wednesday with reporters.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its HBM4 memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 20, 2025. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay SNAP benefits that help feed 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.The oral ruling by Judge Jack McConnell, which directed that those food stamp benefits be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible,\" came a day before the administration was set to cut off the aid.\"There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\" McConnell said.McConnell's ruling came minutes after another federal judge in Boston, who is overseeing a separate but similar lawsuit, said that the group of states that are plaintiffs in that case is likely to prove that the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits was \"unlawful.\"That judge, Indira Talwani, gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.President Donald Trump, in a statement on social media later Friday, said, \"Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.\"\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he said.Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case before McConnell argued at a court hearing Friday that the cutoff of SNAP benefits was an \"arbitrary and capricious act\" that had caused \"a crisis\" for the Americans who need food stamps to eat.A Justice Department lawyer argued that SNAP did not exist anymore because there were no congressionally appropriated funds for it as a result of the shutdown.The lawyer, Tyler Becker, also argued it was the administration's discretion whether to use up to $6 billion in contingency funds already set aside by Congress to continue issuing SNAP benefits.\"There is no SNAP program and, as a result, the government cannot just provide SNAP benefits,\" Becker said.\"A shutdown is not an emergency,\" said Becker, adding that if there was an emergency, it had been created by Congress in failing to appropriate money to keep the government operating.But McConnell told the administration to use the available contingency funds to maintain at least some of the SNAP benefits that are normally paid.The judge also said the administration needed to examine whether other federal funds would be available to keep the program operating in the absence of a funding bill by Congress.McConnell's ruling granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence against the Trump administration to maintain the benefits.White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, during an interview Friday afternoon with NBC News' \"Meet the Press Now,\" would not say whether the Trump administration would comply with either court ruling. Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO

Senate procedural vote\"Today's ruling is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table,\" the coalition of plaintiffs said in a statement.\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon,\" the coalition said. \"This victory is about more than one program — it's about the American values of fairness, compassion, and accountability that hold our democracy together.\"The plaintiffs include a group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions and business organizations.The Boston judge, Talwani, in her separate order on Friday, said she was still considering the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to maintain the benefits.But she also ordered the administration to tell her by Monday if it would \"authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised both rulings.\"Good,\" Schumer wrote in a post on the social media site X.\"Trump's decision to cut off SNAP was vindictive and heartless,\" Schumer wrote.\"He was trying to manufacture a hunger crisis so he wouldn't have to fix healthcare. No president in American history has cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump during his own first term.\"Hassett, the National Economic Council director, blasted the rulings.\"We're about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture because of a liberal judge ruling that we disagree at the law on,\" Hassett said in an interview on Fox News.\"But then we don't have our emergency funds in case we have a hurricane or we have an emergency -- a food emergency,\" Hassett said. \"And so we've got to get the government open. We've got to do it as soon as possible. And the Democrats really don't have a plan.\"The Trump administration blames Senate Democrats for the shutdown, given their refusal to vote for a short-term funding bill proposed by House Republicans, which does not include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats insist on.",

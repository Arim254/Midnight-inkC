    "body": "Shawn DeRemer, husband of Lori Chavez-DeRemer, U.S. President Trump’s nominee to be secretary of labor, sits, on the day Chavez-DeRemer testifies before a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 19, 2025.Kent Nishimura | ReutersAt least two female staffers have alleged that they were sexually assaulted at the Labor Department building by the husband of Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, MS Now confirmed on Thursday night.Chavez-DeRemer's husband, Dr. Shawn DeRemer, has not been criminally charged, but has been barred from the Labor Department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., after the women detailed their claims to investigators, MS Now confirmed.The New York Times first reported the situation on Thursday, citing people familiar with the situation and a police report.\"This is an active investigation by MPD's Sexual Assault Unit,\" a Washington Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told CNBC when contacted about the Times' account of one accuser filing a police report in late January. \"We cannot confirm the names of potential suspects or witnesses.The women said Dr. DeRemer, who is an anesthesiologist in Portland, Oregon, \"had touched them inappropriately at the Labor Department's building on Constitution Avenue,\" according to the Times.\"One of the incidents, during working hours on the morning of Dec. 18, was recorded on office security cameras,\" the Times reported, citing people familiar with the case. \"The video showed Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace, and was reviewed as part of a criminal investigation, one of the people said.A source who spoke with MS Now said in that incident, Dr. DeRemer is seen giving that woman a hug that went on for too long and turned \"creepy,\" according to that news outlet.The Labor Department's inspector general, an internal watchdog, is investigating the situation, according to The Times. The paper also reported that Washington's Metropolitan Police Department on Jan. 24 filed a report about forced sexual contact at the department in December.CNBC obtained a public copy of that police report, which says, \"The complainant reported a sexual contact against her will\" during an incident at 11:30 a.m. ET on Dec. 18 at the Department of Labor building.The complainant's name was not given in the public copy of the report, nor was the name of the alleged assailant.Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe inspector general's office would not confirm or deny it was conducting an investigation when contacted by CNBC.Dr. DeRemer, the Labor Department, the Police Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.The Times in late January reported that a member of Secretary Chavez-DeRemer's security detail with whom she had been accused of having a romantic relationship, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the inspector general.The Labor Department's social media account in January posted a video that featured a slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history.The caption above that video said, \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.\"Social media users noted similarities between the Labor Department's post and a Nazi Party slogan.The slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer,\" which the U.S. Holocaust Museum notes was used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, translates to \"One People, One Country, One Leader.\"",

Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next Tuesday, a primetime slot for the newly elected state executive to lay out the Democratic Party's vision ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections. Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earl-Sears by 15 points in last year's elections, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control. She was previously a member of the House of Representatives from Virginia.The rebuttal to the State of the Union is a high-stakes opportunity for the party outside of the White House to lay out its vision for the country after the president gives his speech. The stakes are even higher for Democrats this year, who are looking to rip away Trump's complete control of Washington in the midterm elections. \"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring,\" Spanberger said in a statement announcing her speech. \"Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve — leaders who are working hard to deliver for them.\"House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Spanberger \"stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening.\"And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she will \"lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation.\"Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., gave the rebuttal to Trump's joint session of Congress last year. The last time a governor gave the rebuttal was in 2022 when Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke following President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.",

They were on stage at the India AI Impact Summit, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, among others. Both had been keynote speakers.Modi had lifted Altman and Pichai's hands before an applauding crowd, with others following suit. However, Altman and Amodei, who were next to each other, raised their fists instead of holding hands with one another. It comes as competition intensifies between ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Claude maker Anthropic, with both vying for their models to become the default choice for consumers globally. The companies have also recently traded shots over the potential use of adverts in AI models.The image of Altman and Amodei opting out of holding hands quickly made the rounds on social media.Siddharth Bhatia, cofounder of AI startup Puch AI, posted on X: \"When AGI? The day Dario and Sam hold hands.\"Justine Moore, an investing partner at Andreesen Horowitz, shared a picture with the words: \"When you're forced to do a group project with your opp.\"watch nowLast month, Anthropic released Super Bowl commercials that poked fun at OpenAI's plan to start testing ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. Altman called the ads \"clearly dishonest,\" saying: \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"Anthropic's chief customer officer, Paul Smith, later told CNBC that it was focused on growing its business rather than making \"flashy headlines,\" in a veiled swipe at OpenAI.Speaking at the summit after the photo, Altman told CNBC: \"We still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best.\"Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI staff and researchers, including Amodei, who left the company after disagreements over its direction. The company has marketed itself as a \"safety-first\" alternative.OpenAI and Anthropic have since raised billions of dollars of capital as they've competed for users, enterprise customers and market share.During his speech at the summit on Thursday, Amodei discussed the \"serious risks\" associated with AI, including the autonomous behavior of AI systems, their potential misuse by individuals and governments, and the potential for economic displacement.During his speech, Altman argued that the industry's understanding of AI safety should include \"societal resilience,\" adding: \"We believe no AI lab can deliver a good future on their own.\"",

    "body": "Les Wexner speaks during a deposition about Jeffrey Epstein. Courtesy: GOP Oversight via YouTubeJeffrey Epstein would \"name drop\" President Donald Trump as one of the many high-profile people he claimed to know, billionaire retail magnate Leslie Wexner said this week in a congressional deposition about the notorious sex offender.The 88-year-old Wexner, who was one of Epstein's top clients and benefactors, said Epstein \"held [Trump] out as a friend,\" according to a video of the deposition that House Democrats released Thursday.But Wexner, the retired founder of Victoria's Secret ex-parent L Brands, said he did not believe Trump and Epstein were actually friends. And he denied seeing or hearing anything about Trump having a sexual relationship with someone introduced to him by Epstein or his convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.He also told lawmakers that both Trump and Epstein would sometimes be at the lingerie company's fashion shows — though he suggested it was a \"coincidence\" and that he can't recall \"something ... that would put them together.\"\"I remember because Trump would always introduce himself to me, and I always thought it was kind of odd that he was at the fashion show because he had nothing to do with fashion,\" Wexner said.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The deposition occurred as the Department of Justice's recent release of millions of additional Epstein-related files raises new questions about the late sex criminal's ties to a growing list of prominent figures.Video of the nearly five-hour deposition, conducted Wednesday in New Albany, Ohio, where Wexner lives, was shared on the YouTube account for the House Oversight Committee's Republican majority. Democrats on the Oversight panel, who had traveled to Ohio for the deposition, said that no Republican committee members attended.They also expressed skepticism about Wexner's insistence that he had virtually no social life with Epstein, and they vowed to continue investigating.\"I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship\" with Epstein, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the panel's ranking member, told reporters Wednesday.Asked if he had a relationship with Trump, Wexner laughed and said he did not. Despite their occasional exchanges at the fashion shows, \"we didn't know each other,\" Wexner said. \"I'd be shocked if he remembered me.\"Trump has never discussed Epstein with Wexner, he said.But when asked if Epstein ever discussed Trump with him, Wexner paused and then said, \"I would describe it — he would name drop it.\"\"So he would say things like, 'I know [former President Bill] Clinton or I know the Pope or I know God... It was that kind of name dropping, but never, I can't remember [a] specific place, but Jeffrey dropped a lot of names.\"Asked to clarify that Epstein specifically referenced Trump, Wexner seemed to backtrack. \"No, I'm saying it could have and I don't remember,\" he said.Wexner also said Epstein never shared any information with him about Trump's sexual activities.The comments revealed from the deposition video align with the prepared statement Wexner gave the committee, in which he claimed he was \"duped\" and \"conned\" by Epstein but was uninvolved with, and ignorant of, any of his criminal activities.Wexner in the deposition also denied ever meeting prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in Epstein's presence. Giuffre has claimed that Wexner sexually abused her. Wexner, in his prepared statement, said he has never been unfaithful to his wife in 33 years of marriage.",

    "body": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, brother of Britain’s King Charles, leaves Aylsham Police Station in a vehicle on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, England, Feb. 19, 2026.Phil Noble | ReutersBritish police on Thursday released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former prince and the brother of King Charles III, after having arrested him earlier on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The nature of the investigation has not been revealed. But Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest came after renewed focus on his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the now-dead notorious sex offender, after the U.S. Department of Justice released millions of documents about Epstein.Thames Valley Police, who had arrested Mountbatten-Windsor without publicly identifying him, had said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.Thames Valley Police, in a statement, said, \"On Thursday ... we arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"The arrested man has now been released under investigation,\" police said. \"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded. Our searches in Berkshire are still underway.\"King Charles, in a statement earlier Thursday following the arrest of his brother, said, \"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,\" the king said. \"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\"President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, called Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest \"a shame.\"\"I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad. To me, it's a very sad thing,\" said Trump, who himself is a former friend of Epstein.Charles stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his title of prince in October and forced him out of his home near Windsor Castle because of his ties to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges filed in New York.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, including allegations that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre, a known victim of Epstein, when she was 17 years old.In February 2022, Mountbatten-Windsor reached a confidential settlement with Giuffre of her lawsuit in New York federal court related to those allegations, without admitting wrongdoing.But he agreed at the time to what was called \"a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,\" and in a statement said he regretted his association with Epstein, and commended \"the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\"Giuffre died by suicide last April.Maria Farmer, a victim of Epstein, in a statement Thursday after the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor, said, \"Today is just the beginning of accountability and justice brought forth by Virginia Roberts Giuffre — a young mother who adored her daughter so deeply, she fought the most powerful on earth to protect her. She did this for everyone's daughters.\"\"Let's now demand all the dominos of power and corruption begin to fall,\" Farmer said.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.",

    "body": "Signs for Walmart (L) and Amazon.Getty ImagesFor the first time, Amazon has dethroned Walmart as the company with the largest annual revenue. Walmart on Thursday reported annual revenue of $713.2 billion for its most recent fiscal year, shy of Amazon's $716.9 billion in revenue. The milestone was brewing for months, as Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time about a year ago.The shuffle, while largely symbolic, underscores the battle the two retailers have waged both to define and keep up with ever-changing consumer preferences. They are kicking off a new chapter of that rivalry as artificial intelligence reshapes how companies operate, make money and drive sales. Amazon rose to the top of the revenue pile by doing much more than running a sprawling online web store and promising speedy delivery. While its core retail unit is its largest revenue generator, its huge cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses also fuel its sales. Third-party seller services, which include commissions and fees collected by Amazon fulfillment along with shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for about 24% of the company's total sales in 2025, according to its latest annual filing. Amazon Web Services was responsible for roughly 18%.It wasn't Walmart's weakness that led it to lose its top spot, as its revenue has more than doubled in 20 years. The retailer has leaned on its more than 4,600 Walmart stores and roughly 600 Sam's Club locations in the U.S. to power its digital business, which grew by 27% in the U.S. in the fiscal fourth quarter and has posted double-digit percentage gains for 15 straight quarters.That expansion came as Walmart riffed off the Amazon playbook and tried to position itself as a tech company as well as a retailer. There have been multiple signs of its ambitions: Walmart relisted its stock, moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq in early December. Its market value surpassed the $1 trillion mark earlier this month, a valuation achieved almost exclusively by tech companies, including Amazon, after a more than 21% rise in the last year. And the big-box retailer's fourth-quarter earnings, which were boosted by digital advertising and its third-party marketplace, illustrated Walmart's emphasis on chasing higher-margin businesses and thinking beyond brick-and-mortar retail.Amazon and Walmart's AI ambitionsIn many ways, Walmart's recent push to grow its third-party marketplace was an answer to the dominance of Amazon's platform. Even as it tries to catch up with Amazon in some areas, Walmart is trying to gain an edge in a new frontier.Over the past few years, Amazon and Walmart have used different AI strategies to try to make their businesses more efficient and make their merchandise more appealing to shoppers.Walmart struck a deal with OpenAI's ChatGPT in October and Google's Gemini in January to make its products easier to discover and buy. It also has its own AI-powered shopping assistant, Sparky. The virtual assistant, which looks like a smiley face, pops up on Walmart's app and can help shoppers find items. Walmart, like many other companies, is in the early days of AI adoption, and it's unclear how the technology will affect its business long-term. On the company's earnings call on Thursday, Walmart CEO John Furner said customers are spending more when they use Sparky. He said customers who use Sparky have an average order value that's about 35% higher than shoppers who don't use the tool.About half of Walmart's app users have used Sparky, Walmart U.S. CEO David Guggina said on the earnings call.\"Agentic AI is increasingly embedded across Walmart,\" Guggina said. \"It's strengthening our operations. It's improving associate productivity, and it's enhancing the customer experience.\"Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said AI investments are included in the retailer's capital expenditure plans for the full year, which are expected to be roughly 3.5% of sales. Those expenses also include the company's investments in automation and store remodels. There are limits to Walmart's tech ambitions. When it comes to AI, Rainey said Walmart will lean on the expertise of tech companies rather than try to create its own products.\"As you've seen from the announcements we've made, we're approaching AI development through partnerships,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"This lets tech companies do what they do best, develop innovative technology, and it provides us clarity to do what we do best, to translate the best of tech to retail experiences that create value for our customers and members and our enterprise.\"Like Walmart, Amazon is also facing new pressure to respond to the rise of agentic commerce. Chatbot makers like OpenAI, Google and Perplexity have introduced automated commerce features that aim to change how people shop online. While other companies like Walmart, Etsy and Shopify have announced shopping partnerships with AI platforms, Amazon has remained on the sidelines. It's blocked agents from accessing its site and has doubled down on its own shopping chatbot, Rufus, which is powered by its own models and Anthropic's chatbot Claude.The company said Rufus has been used by more than 300 million customers and drove almost $12 billion in incremental annualized sales last year. After slowly rolling out the service in beta two years ago, Amazon has injected Rufus across more areas of its app and website to encourage shoppers to use the tool.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last month that Rufus and other AI tools could assist shoppers with finding products much like an employee in a physical store.\"I think agents are going to help customers with that type of discovery,\" Jassy said. \"And it's part of why we've invested so much in Rufus, which is our shopping assistant.\"Meanwhile, Amazon is throwing piles of cash at AI infrastructure. Earlier this month, it announced it would spend up to $200 billion this year on AI initiatives, more than any of the other hyperscalers, which combined have forecast nearly $700 billion in 2026 expenditures. Most of Amazon's spending is expected to go to data centers, chips and networking equipment.Wall Street has viewed Amazon's capex plans skeptically, sending the company's shares down for nine days straight following its Feb. 5 earnings report and shaving more than $450 billion off of its market value.Amazon's investments aren't limited to AI compute. The company has also put significant resources and talent behind developing AI tools across all of its businesses. It has also rolled out a suite of AI models and revamped its Alexa assistant. It also has invested $8 billion in Anthropic since 2023.— CNBC's Robert Hum contributed to this report",

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign is seen at an AutoZone on Feb. 11, 2026 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWith the upheaval of the Covid pandemic came opportunity, as a shift in the labor market gave workers unprecedented opportunities for mobility and a chance to climb the pay scale.The \"great resignation,\" as it came to be known, saw record numbers of employees quit in favor of better opportunities, as companies couldn't hire workers fast enough to fill the vacancies that the pandemic helped create. A record 4.5 million left their jobs for greener pastures in March 2022. But that is changing.The level of \"quits\" as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has contracted by nearly one-third since hitting its peak in early 2022, a period during which job openings have nearly halved. One metric helps further tell the story: During the same period, the disparity between average annual pay increases for those staying in their jobs and for those leaving has all but collapsed, going from a peak of 8.4 percentage points in April 2022 to 1.9 percentage points in January. That's the lowest level since payrolls processing firm ADP began tracking the data in November 2020.Call it the \"big stay,\" or just another outgrowth of the low-hire, low-fire labor market, but it's a trend that has significance for workers.A pendulum swing\"It's a very stable labor market. There's very little hiring, very little firing,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"It's an outgrowth of the pandemic from where it was all hands on deck.\"A lack of labor supply and a pernicious skills gap was the story when the economy was trying to recover from the massive drawdown it had seen during the early Covid days. Workers and employers were adjusting to the new world of hybrid work, and companies were hungry for new recruits.As the \"great resignation\" peaked, there were more than two job openings per each worker the BLS classified as unemployed. That pendulum has swung back, however, and there are now more available workers than openings.watch nowLayoffs, though, remain low. Last week saw just 206,000 initial jobless claims, with the longer-term average at 219,000, about in line with historical norms for a healthy labor market. Though hiring has slowed considerably, the unemployment rate is just 4.3%. \"If you were to parachute into this labor market in any time period of the United States, you'd be mostly happy with what you found,\" Richardson said. \"The action is in the granular data.\"For instance, pay trends are peculiar to industries. In the high-turnover leisure and hospitality industry, pay gains are better for job stayers, with the disparity at 2.5% in stayers' favor, according to ADP. However, construction, which is struggling with labor supply during the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, has a 6.6 percentage point advantage for switchers.The incentives are still strong for switchers, with annual pay growth averaging 6.4% in January, well above the 4.5% for stayers, according to ADP data. But the gap is narrowing and could close further due to current labor market moves.A new realityThe trends come with a fresh flock of workers combing the want ads for jobs.Searches were up 31% in January from December while job postings were little changed, according to Indeed Hiring Lab.\"The reality facing those seeking jobs in 2026 is that openings per unemployed person have declined, and hiring timelines are lengthening,\" Indeed experts Laura Ullrich and Sneha Puri wrote. \"While some sectors continue to see elevated levels of postings, the macro environment remains in the low-hire, low-fire stagnation of 2025.\"Even with the low unemployment rate, Richardson said she is concerned with the \"lack of dynamism in the labor market\" as most hires are in the health-care industry and turnover is receding.\"The fact that it is low-hire, low-fire is actually not a great state to be in. The churn is important to the productivity growth,\" she said. \"You want to see the most talented go to the places where that talent is the most rewarded. And if we are in this really stable period, that means that talent is not being repositioned to its best use.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing about the annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 4, 2026. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDozens of House Democrats wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday calling for an investigation into possible conflicts of interest and national security concerns related to World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture.The letter, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. and 40 other lawmakers, landed after Bessent testified at a contentious House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this month. Meeks at the hearing called Bessent a \"flunky\" of President Donald Trump and raised questions about a $500 million stake that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — a royal from the United Arab Emirates also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — bought in World Liberty Financial last year.\"The Trump family's $500 million deal connected to the Emirati royal family is not only a matter of national financial instability, but it also carries serious national security implications,\" Meeks said in a statement accompanying the letter. \"Trust that the record will reflect whether Secretary Bessent chooses to answer to the American people, or his mob boss.\"The request for a probe was made as World Liberty Financial is seeking a national bank charter, a distinction reviewed and issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent arm of the Treasury Department that regulates banks. World Liberty Financial held a day-long forum Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago where presidential sons Don Jr. and Eric Trump touted the family's stablecoin and called traditional banking a \"Ponzi scheme.\"Meeks at the hearing asked Bessent to commit to pause any pending applications from World Liberty Financial before the OCC and to complete an investigation into the \"conflicts of interest and foreign influence.\"\"The OCC is an independent entity,\" Bessent said then, over the shouts of Meeks, without addressing the topic further.President Donald Trump and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are co-founders emeritus of the company, which is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.\"This is no longer just a debate about crypto chartering theory. It is about foreign ownership, national security, regulatory integrity, and whether our bank-chartering process is resilient to political and geopolitical pressure,\" the lawmakers wrote Thursday.In the letter, Democratic members asked for information on the safeguards in place to ensure that \"foreign government officials, sovereign proxies, or politically connected investors cannot use the bank-chartering process to gain leverage over the U.S. financial system or access sensitive financial or technological infrastructure.\"It also asks what role the White House, Office and Management and Budget and Treasury have in \"reviewing, approving, or otherwise influencing national bank or trust chartering decisions made by the\" OCC. It lawmakers requested a response from Treasury by Feb. 26.A Treasury Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"The credibility of America's banking regulatory framework, and of the institutions charged with protecting it, depends on transparency, independence, and a demonstrated willingness to resist undue influence,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Our constituents need confidence that our banking system is governed by law, not proximity to power; by prudential judgment, not political convenience.\"",

Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAccenture has told senior staff they must regularly use its AI tools to be considered for promotions for leadership roles.Associate directors and senior managers at the consultancy giant were informed that \"regular adoption\" of AI would be required to progress to leadership positions, according to an FT report. An Accenture spokesperson told CNBC the report was correct. They added: \"Our strategy is to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients and to be the most client-focused, AI-enabled, great place to work. \"That requires the adoption of the latest tools and technologies to serve our clients most effectively.\"The spokesperson also confirmed that, as the FT reported, the policy had been set out in an internal email. \"Use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions,\" the email said, according to the FT. The FT reported that Accenture staff in 12 European countries were unaffected by the policy, as well as staff working in the division that handles U.S. government contracts. watch nowIn September, Accenture outlined a restructuring strategy in which it said staff who are unable to reskill on AI would eventually be laid off.On an earnings call, CEO Julie Sweet said all employees would be expected to \"retrain and retool\" at scale, adding that 550,000 workers had already been reskilled on the fundamentals of generative AI. Accenture employs a total of 780,000 people globally.\"Our No. 1 strategy is upskilling, given the skills we need, and we've had a lot of experience in upskilling, we're trying to, in a very compressed timeline, where we don't have a viable path for skilling, sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need,\" Sweet added.Sweet told CNBC at the time: \"Our early investment in AI is really paying off.\"\"Every CEO, board and the C-suite recognize that advanced AI is critical to the future. The challenge right now they're facing is that they're really excited about the technology and they're not yet AI ready for most companies,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"Accenture announced a string of partnerships and tools in recent months. Accenture partnered with OpenAI in December to give tens of thousands of its employees access to ChatGPT Enterprise and continue to upskill on AI. Accenture also partnered with Anthropic to train 30,000 employees on Claude AI tools, with tens of thousands of Accenture developers to use Claude Code for coding and AI-assisted work.Other ventures include partnering with Palantir so that over 2,000 Accenture staff can get AI training using the software company's platforms.",

    "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announces new nutrition policies during a press conference in Washington, Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. \"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,\" he said. \"We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.\"But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. \"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,\" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. \"The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.\"Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he \"can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.\"\"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,\" Cook said. \"If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.\"Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing \"an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.\"Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.\"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,\" the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. \"This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.\"House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.",

    "body": "Canadian filmmaker James Cameron poses during a photocall for the opening of the exhibition entitled 'The Art of James Cameron' at the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris on April 3, 2024.Stephane De Sakutin | AFP | Getty ImagesLegendary \"Titanic\" director James Cameron is likening the theatrical experience to a \"sinking ship\" if Netflix acquires Warner Bros. Discovery's film studio. Cameron penned a letter last week to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that was obtained by CNBC, in which he argues Netflix's proposed acquisition of WBD's studio and streaming assets could lead to massive job losses in Hollywood, fundamentally alter the theatrical landscape in the U.S. and negatively affect one of America's largest export sectors.Lee chairs the Senate subcommittee on antitrust, competitive policy and consumer rights, which held a hearing on Feb. 3 to discuss the potential impact of the Netflix-Warner Bros. transaction. Cameron sent his letter after the hearing, during which Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and WBD executive Bruce Campbell testified. \"I believe strongly that the proposed sale of Warner Brothers Discovery to Netflix will be disastrous for the theatrical motion picture business that I have dedicated my life's work to,\" Cameron wrote to Lee. \"Of course, my films all play in the downstream video markets as well, but my first love is the cinema.\"Cameron has been vocal in his opposition to the proposed tie-up, and his concerns echo those of the broader filmmaking industry, which generally sees combinations of movie studios resulting in fewer releases and less work. Cameron's letter to Lee, which has not been previously reported, escalates his concerns to the lawmakers who could potentially stand in the way of Netflix completing its acquisition. \"We have received outreach from actors, directors, and other interested parties about the proposed Netflix and Warner Brothers merger, and I share many of their concerns,\" Lee said in a statement. \"I look forward to holding a follow-up hearing to further address these issues.\"In response to a request for comment, a Netflix representative pointed to Netflix's written testimony and Sarandos' comments during the hearing. In its written testimony, Netflix outlined its investments in the film and TV production industry and its impact on the overall U.S. economy, including $20 billion in planned film and TV spend in 2026, a majority of which it said will be spent in America. \"With this deal, we're going to increase, not reduce, production investments going forward, supported by a stronger combined business and balance sheet,\" Netflix said, noting its production facilities, such as one in New Mexico and an upcoming New Jersey-based studio. Since the deal's announcement, Netflix's top brass have consistently voiced their belief that the deal would not only win regulatory approval but would be good for the media industry.During a recent earnings call, Sarandos called the deal \"pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"He has said on multiple occasions that the addition of WBD's studio would preserve jobs — even as layoffs roil the media ecosystem — and has said the assets would bring new businesses under Netflix's umbrella.\"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"In addition to concerns specific to filmmakers and across the theater industry, the proposed Netflix-WBD transaction has awakened other regulatory questions. In particular, critics have raised alarm about bringing together two of the top global streaming services — Netflix with 325 million global subscribers and WBD's HBO Max with 128 million as of Sept. 30. Lawmakers have already questioned how a merger of those services would affect consumers and prices.Paramount Skydance has leveraged some of the same arguments in its attempt to unseat Netflix and buy the entirety of WBD through a hostile tender offer. Sarandos and co-CEO Greg Peters have argued that competition for viewers includes various platforms — from traditional TV to streaming services to social media platforms such as YouTube — making Netflix a small part of the ecosystem.watch nowTheatrical shiftsCameron, who has pioneered the creation of new filming technologies during his decadeslong career, including 3D production systems, advanced visual effects and high-frame-rate display, noted that theatrical exhibition has been a critical part of his \"creative vision.\"He also highlighted previous comments by Sarandos calling movie theaters \"an outdated concept\" and an \"outmoded idea,\" in addition to comments telling investors that \"driving folks to a theater is just not our business.\"\"The business model of Netflix is directly at odds with the theatrical film production and exhibition business, which employs hundreds of thousands of Americans,\" Cameron wrote. \"It is therefore directly at odds with the business model of the Warner Brothers movie division, one of the few remaining major movie studios.\"Cameron noted that WBD releases around 15 theatrical films a year, volume that movie theater operators rely on at a time when production has shrunk and consumer habits have shifted.He also suggested that the merger would \"remove consumer choice by reducing the number of feature motion pictures that are made\" as well as \"restrict the choices of film-makers looking for studios to invest in their projects, which will in turn reduce jobs.\"Cameron touched on recent trade policy shifts by the Trump administration that have sought to protect U.S. exports. President Donald Trump has more than once floated the idea of tariffs to protect Hollywood. \"The US may no longer lead in auto or steel manufacturing, but it is still the world leader in movies,\" Cameron said. Under a Netflix-WBD merger, \"That will change for the worse.\"Cameron also questioned whether Netflix would honor verbal commitments its executives have made around future theatrical releases, including how long they would play in theaters and how many theaters they would play in. In its written testimony from earlier this month, Netflix said it plans to put Warner Bros. films in theaters with 45-day windows and would continue to employ these employees, since \"we don't have those kinds of workers at Netflix today.\" \"We are not acquiring these amazing assets to shut them down, but to build them up,\" according to the testimony.Still, Cameron questioned whether those commitments would hold. \"Their pledge to support theatrical releases (a business fundamentally at odds with their core business model) is likely to evaporate in a few years,\" he said. \"Once they own a major movie studio, that is irrevocable,\" he added. \"That ship has sailed (as I like to say, mindful that I directed 'Titanic.' I am very familiar not only with ships that sail, but also those that sink. And the theatrical experience of movies could become a sinking ship.)\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., Feb. 13, 2026. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersThe Trump administration has warned it would be \"very wise\" for Iran to make a deal, amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously reported progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the \"guiding principles\" for the negotiations.Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that there were \"many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,\" noting that the two countries remain \"very far apart\" on some issues.U.S. President Donald Trump had a \"very successful\" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\"watch now\"The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration,\" Leavitt said. The White House has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, although U.S. media has reported that the military could be prepared to strike Iran as early as the weekend. 'Extremely dangerous' situationBoth the U.S. and Iran have increased military activity in the oil-producing Middle East region in recent weeks.The U.S., for its part, has built up a significant presence of air and naval assets, while Iran has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz and announced joint naval drills with Russia in the Gulf of Oman, also known as the Sea of Oman.Laura James, Middle East senior analyst at Oxford Analytica, described the current situation as \"extremely dangerous,\" with the U.S. and Iran \"certainly closer\" to an outright conflict than last week.watch now\"The thing that is now a particular concern over the past 24 hours is the very rapid pace at which the United States is reinforcing its air power in the region. That, of course, can still be signaling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome,\" James told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Thursday.\"But as more and more planes come in and more and more equipment comes in, that signaling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand,\" she added.  Oil pricesEnergy market participants have been closely watching the outcome of the U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva, particularly as it relates to the Strait of Hormuz, a major international waterway that Iran partially closed on Tuesday citing \"security precautions.\" Located in the gulf between Oman and Iran, the Strait of Hormuz is recognized as one of the world's most important oil choke points.Iranian military personnel take part in an exercise titled 'Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz', launched by the Naval Forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is being carried out in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz on February 16, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesAbout 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed. Oil prices were higher on Thursday, extending gains after settling up more than 4% in the previous session.

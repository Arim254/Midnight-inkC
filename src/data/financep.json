    "body": "Signage outside Applied Materials headquarters in Santa Clara, California, U.S., on Thursday, May 13, 2021. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChip equipment manufacturer Applied Materials is laying off 4% of its workforce.The company on Thursday began notifying impacted employees around the world \"across all levels and groups,\" it said in a filing. Applied Materials provides equipment, services and software to industries, including the semiconductor industry.Applied Materials had approximately 36,100 full-time employees, according to an August 2025 filing. A layoff of 4% would represent about 1,444 employees.\"Automation, digitalization and geographic shifts are redefining our workforce needs and skill requirements,\" the company wrote in the filing. \"With this in mind, we have been focused for some time on building high-velocity, high-productivity teams, adopting new technologies and simplifying organizational structures.\"The move comes at the end of the company's fiscal year. Earlier this month, the Applied Materials forecasted a $600 million hit to fiscal 2026 revenue after the U.S. expanded its restricted export list. That resulted in company shares to dipping 3% in extended trading.As a result of the workforce reduction, Applied Materials expects to incur charges of approximately $160 million to $180 million, consisting primarily of severance and other one-time employment termination benefits to be paid in cash, the filing states.The company said the cuts are a way to position itself \"as a more competitive and productive organization.\"",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, iPhone screens display various social media apps on the screens on February 9, 2025 in Bath, England.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, said on Friday that it had preliminarily found both TikTok and Meta in breach of its transparency rules.It accused the U.S. tech giants of breaching their obligation to give researchers \"adequate access\" to public data under the Digital Services Act (DSA) — the EU's landmark tech legislation.\"The Commission also preliminarily found Meta, for both Instagram and Facebook, in breach of its obligations to provide users simple mechanisms to notify illegal content, as well as to allow them to effectively challenge content moderation decisions,\" it added in a statement.The Digital Services Act is among a handful of EU legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check. The Commission has also opened numerous investigations under another landmark law known as the Digital Markets Act.\"We disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters,\" Meta spokesperson Ben Walters said in a statement.\"In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,\" he added.A TikTok spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that it \"is committed to transparency and values the contribution of researchers\" to its platform and social media industry as a whole.\"We have made substantial investments in data sharing and almost 1000 research teams have been given access to data through our Research Tools to date,\" the spokesperson said.\"We are reviewing the European Commission's findings, but requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\" they added.The EU says researchers should have access to social media platforms' data, as this enables the public to scrutinize any potential physical or mental health impacts of the technology.The Commission said in its preliminary findings that Facebook, Instagram and TikTok \"may have put in place burdensome procedures and tools for researchers to request access to public data. This often leaves them with partial or unreliable data, impacting their ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.\"The tech companies are now invited by the Commission to examine its findings and reply in writing.If the Commission's preliminary findings are upheld, it has the power to issue a non-compliance decision which could carry with it a fine of up to 6% of the total worldwide annual turnover — a hefty amount for Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance.Meta also faced a 200 million euros ($228.4 million) fine under the Digital Markets Act in April, as the Commission flexed its new competition powers for the first time. The fine was related to how users consented to data collection.Meanwhile, TikTok's transfer of data to China also resulted in it being handed a 530 million euros fine by the protection authority in Ireland earlier this year.— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",

    "body": "ESPN and YouTube TV.David Buono | Icon Sportswire | Jaque Silva | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesJust a month after reaching an agreement with NBCUniversal to avoid dropping its networks, YouTube TV has another potential blackout on its hands — this time with Disney.Disney said Thursday it would begin running public messages for YouTube TV subscribers to alert customers that the company's networks, including ABC and ESPN, will be dropped from the service if the two sides can't reach a new distribution agreement, which expires October 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.\"This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we don't reach a fair deal soon, YouTube TV customers will lose access to ESPN and ABC, and all our marquee programming — including the NFL, college football, NBA and NHL seasons — and so much more.\"Disney began running public announcements on YouTube TV at 5 p.m. ET.As with NBCUniversal, YouTube TV is asking for better rates for Disney's programming, according to people familiar with the discussions. YouTube TV has about 10 million subscribers and wants more favorable terms given their scale, the people said.\"We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney's own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo. Without an agreement, we'll have to remove Disney's content from YouTube TV and if it remains unavailable for an extended period of time, we will offer subscribers a $20 credit.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.YouTube TV and NBCUniversal first reached a temporary extension to avoid a blackout before inking a finalized deal a few days later.Two years ago, Disney reached an unusual distribution agreement with Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers, that gave certain Charter subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney is willing to offer YouTube TV the same terms as that Charter agreement, two of the people said.YouTube TV is again asking to ingest Disney's streaming content, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the YouTube platform, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. YouTube TV also asked for this in its negotiations with NBCUniversal and was rejected. Similarly, Disney has no plans to say yes to this request, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.The clash between Disney and YouTube has an added element of conflict. YouTube hired away former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach of contract lawsuit. Connolly has recused himself from these discussions, according to the people familiar with the process.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "NBA and FanDuel online sports betting signage is displayed on the side of a building in Phoenix, Arizona, on June 5, 2024.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images\"This is the insider trading saga for the NBA.\"That was FBI Director Kash Patel's message at a news conference Thursday, announcing the arrests of Portland Trailblazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier.The two were among more than 30 people charged in an illegal poker ring involving organized crime and cheating, according to prosecutors. The U.S. Attorney, FBI and other law enforcement agencies are also charging Rozier as well as former Cleveland Cavaliers player and assistant coach Damon Jones with a sports betting scheme to throw games or make illegal wagers on inside information.It's the kind of news that could prove damaging to the legal gambling industry — or, perhaps, a real opportunity.Legal licensed sportsbooks in the U.S. have enjoyed massive growth in recent years, but they're still trying to expand. The market leaders FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM and Caesars don't have access to the two most populous states, California and Texas, because they have not legalized sports gambling.When state lawmakers debate the pros and cons of legalizing sports betting, there are persistent questions about sports integrity and the opportunities for cheating. Players arrested on federal charges, accused of manipulating game play and profiting on illegal activity provide solid evidence for a sermon against the dangers of gambling.The commercial gambling industry knows it. And it's seizing the moment to reiterate its protections.\"Today's events are deeply disturbing, and should concern fans, athletes, and everyone who loves sports and values integrity and fair play,\" FanDuel, owned by Flutter, said in a statement to CNBC shortly after federal prosecutors and law enforcement wrapped up their news conference.\"We are unwavering in our commitment to rooting out abuses by those who seek to undermine fair competition and the games we love,\" FanDuel said.The American Gaming Association blasted out its statement: \"Today's revelations are a stark reminder of the pervasive and predatory illegal market, ensnaring countless individuals and operating in the shadows ... It is important to recognize that the regulated legal market delivers transparency, oversight, and collaboration with authorities that assists in bringing these bad actors to light.\"A DraftKings spokesman told CNBC, \"We fundamentally believe that regulated online sports betting is the best way forward, to monitor for and detect suspicious behavior.\"Sportsbooks and the integrity monitoring companies that work with them were involved in alerting authorities to unusually large wagers on Jontay Porter prop bets that resulted in Porter being banned for life from the NBA last year and convicted on federal charges.Prosecutors say Porter's activity was part of the same conspiracy ring operating between 2022 and 2024 that resulted in six arrests this week.A rapid response from the sportsbooks with carefully crafted crisis communications messages could be designed to ward off threats from state gaming regulators to crack down on player props, which are often the basis of parlay bets.Parlays, which combine several bet criteria into a single wager, are very profitable for the sportsbooks and popular with customers, even though there are lower chances of winning.The negative headlines over illegal gambling could ultimately prove to be an opportunity in the long run for commercial and tribal casinos if it prompts more enforcement action against unlicensed operators.After all, unlicensed gambling in the U.S. is estimated to bring in $674 billion in wagers annually, the AGA said in August.",

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

    "body": "A Ford logo on a Ford F-150 pickup truck for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S. Oct. 20, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but lowered its 2025 guidance due to impacts of a supplier fire, which is disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs.The Detroit automaker said the fire last month at a New York plant for aluminum supplier Novelis is expected to cost it between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, but it expects to mitigate much of that this year and next, largely by increasing manufacturing of the impacted vehicles once supplies are more available.Ford stock initially fell during extended trading Thursday before swinging to being up roughly 4%. It closed at $12.34 per share Thursday and the stock is up 24% so far this year.Ford said the total cost of the fire on its business is expected to be less than $1 billion by next year, as the company announced plans Thursday to \"significantly increase\" its U.S. pickup truck production. That includes adding 1,000 workers early next year to plants that produce the vehicles in Michigan and Kentucky. The automaker expects the additional production next year to recoup about half of the 100,000 units it expects to lose due to the fire this year.\"We are working intensively with Novelis and others to source aluminum that can be processed in the cold rolling section of the plant that remains operational while also working to restore overall plant production. We have made substantial progress in a short time to minimize the impact in 2025 and recover production in 2026,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFord stockFord Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra said the fire occurred in one of three main parts of the plant — a hot mill — with the non-impacted areas continuing to operate. The impacted part of the plant is expected to restart sooner than originally expected in late November or early December, he said.Ford's new 2025 guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, down from $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion as of July; adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion to $3 billion, down from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and capital spending of roughly $9 billion, which remains the same.Ford CFO Sherry House said without the supplier fire, the company was planning to raise its 2025 guidance to more than $8 billion in adjusted EBIT rather than cutting it.RBC Markets analyst Tom Narayan in a note Thursday called the guidance change \"effectively\" a raise, backing out the supplier fire and changes in tariff costs.Ford lowered its expected tariff costs by $1 billion, to roughly $2 billion,  half of which the automaker expects to offset through other actions, due to changes Friday by the Trump administration that included exemption and extending tariff offsets on American-made vehicles.Here's what Wall Street expects, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 45 cents adjusted vs. 36 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $47.19 billion vs. $43.08 billion expectedFord said there was no material impact to third-quarter results due to the fire, but that it will impact its fourth-quarter results.The company's third-quarter revenue, including its financial arm, was $50.5 billion, a quarterly record and 9% increase from the same time a year ago. Its net income during the quarter was $2.4 billion, up from $900 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were level at $2.6 billion. Both included adverse net tariff-related impact of $700 million during the third quarter.Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. \"Our performance in the quarter show that the Ford+ plan is delivering consistent improvement. Our underlying business becomes stronger, more efficient, more agile and increasingly durable,\" House told media Thursday.The Ford+ plan is a turnaround and cost-improvement plan under Farley, who started leading the automaker more than five years ago. The company said it remains on track to cut $1 billion in costs this year as part of the plan.Ford's third-quarter results were led by its \"Pro\" commercial and fleet business that reported EBIT results of nearly $2 billion, up $172 million from a year earlier. Its traditional operations, known as \"Ford Blue\" reported EBIT earnings of $1.54 billion, while its \"Model e\" electric vehicle business widened losses by $179 million compared with a year ago, to $1.41 billion.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "A member of staff poses next to trading boards at the London Stock Exchange on April 25, 2025 in London, England.Carl Court | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe amount of money managed by hedge funds has reached an all-time high of $5 trillion, fueled by a surge in capital allocations in the third quarter coupled with positive investment returns.Analysis published Thursday by industry tracker Hedge Fund Research (HFR) showed total global assets under management stood at a landmark $4.98 trillion at the end of the third quarter.Overall industry assets swelled by $238.4 billion in the three-month period that ended Sept. 30.This included $33.7 billion in net new allocations from investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and family offices. HFR said that was the biggest quarterly net asset inflow since the third quarter of 2007 — before the Global Financial Crisis.The remainder of the third-quarter capital increase stemmed from positive trading gains made by managers throughout the three-month period.Here, HFR's main Fund Weighted Composite Index — which aims to provide an overall snapshot of the industry — gained 5.4% during the period.The index, which tracks the gains and losses of more than 1,400 single manager funds across all strategy types, is up 9.5% since the start of 2025.HFR president Kenneth Heinz said the \"historic growth\" has been driven by a mix of rising M&A activity among corporates, successful bets on the ongoing AI and tech boom and growing expectations for lower interest rates.\"While risk-on sentiment has dominated recent months, risks have also evolved, with managers participating in acceleration of these trends through year end but also positioning for sentiment and trend reversals across equities, commodities, currencies and cryptocurrencies,\" Heinz said.More to come?The big winners during the third quarter were equity hedge fund managers, who trade stocks long and short, often using thematic analyses, sector-specific approaches and fundamental single-company research.During the third quarter, they made 7.2% in investment returns, and saw their assets grow by $96.7 billion, including positive investor net inflows of $18 billion.Overall, that brought equity-focused funds' total capital to $1.5 trillion — making them the biggest hedge fund sub-strategy in terms of assets. Year-to-date, stock-picking strategies have gained about 13.6%.The other key beneficiary has been macro hedge funds, which invest in macroeconomic and geopolitical trends using equities, bonds, currencies, commodities and other assets.General view of the City of London skyline, the capital's financial district.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMacro strategies' assets grew by $33.5 billion overall during Q3, with clients pouring in $1.7 billion net, bringing total macro capital to $759 billion. Macro managers added 4.7% in investment returns in Q3. Having recouped losses suffered earlier in the year, the sector is up 3.8% in the nine months to the end of September.Heinz said the industry can expect more money to flow into its coffers as investors look to traverse a challenging geopolitical environment and trade policy uncertainty.\"Institutions seeking to strategically position for these trends, including both continued acceleration and defensive reversals, are likely to increase allocations to managers which have demonstrated their ability to navigate both the recent risk-on trends, as well as volatile reversals, with these allocations set to drive industry growth beyond the $5 trillion milestone into year-end.\"",

    "body": "The Reliance Industries Ltd. oil refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, on Saturday, July 31, 2021.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia's largest private oil refiner Reliance Industries is reportedly halting purchases of Russian crude, following the U.S.' decision to sanction Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.Reliance has become a major buyer of Russian crude. In September, it purchased around 629,590 barrels of Russian crude per day from the two firms, out of India's total imports of 1.6 million barrels per day, according to data by commodities data analytics firm Kpler.Over the same month last year, Reliance purchased around 428,000 barrels per day of oil from the Russian companies.In fact, India's Russian crude imports used to account for less than 3% of its total crude import basket, but today account for one-third of India's crude imports, experts say.Reliance has not responded to CNBC requests for comment on reports that it is stopping the purchase of Russian crude.It comes as the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday levied sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's \"lack of serious commitment\" to ending the war in Ukraine. The sanctions aim to \"degrade\" the Kremlin's ability to finance its war, the U.S. department said, signaling more measures could follow.If Reliance does halt Russian purchases, it will have \"negative impacts on [Reliance's] margin and profitability as Russian crude constitute more than 50% of [its] crude diet,\" Pankaj Srivastava, SVP of commodity oil markets at market research firm Rystad Energy said in emailed comments.He added that the availability of \"similar crude is not an issue\" and can be sourced from West Asia, Brazil, or Guyana, but Reliance is unlikely to get the same price as it does on Russian crude, as it has long-term deals with suppliers like Rosneft.Last December, Reliance Industries signed a deal to import crude oil worth $12 billion-$13 billion a year from Russia's Rosneft for 10 years, which would translate to roughly 500,000 barrels per day, according to a report by Reuters.'Opportunistic buying'The purchase of Russian oil by Indian refiners was \"opportunistic buying\" driven by discounts versus comparable grades, said Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights.India bought 38% of Russia's crude exports in September, second only to China at 47% according to Helsinki-based think tank Centre for Energy and Clean Air.Hari added that Indian refineries can easily pivot to buying from sources with the trade-off being \"pressure on refining margins.\"Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler, said the Indian refining giant might face some short-term issues as it looks to replace the Russian crude.\"Given the large volumes under the Reliance-Rosneft deal, we expect some short-term friction for Reliance in securing replacement barrels,\" says Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at Kpler.She added that \"Russia's medium-sour Urals remains about $5–6/bbl [barrel] cheaper than Middle Eastern crude of similar quality.A report by Jefferies last month indicated that the impact of Reliance Industries moving away from Russian oil was \"manageable.\"The brokerage said in September that it had received queries from investors about the possible financial impact on Reliance if it halts its imports of Russian oil due to sanctions.The benefit of Russian crude accounts for around 2.1% of the firm's estimated consolidated EBITDA of 2.05 trillion rupees ($ 22.8 billion) for fiscal year 2027, the brokerage said.Reliance's consolidated EBITDA for the six months of fiscal year 2026 was 1.08 trillion Indian rupees ($12.3 billion), of which 295 billion rupees were from its oil-to-chemicals segment, while its telecom and retail ventures together contributed to nearly 500 billion rupees.Hopes of a U.S. trade dealOther Indian refiners are also looking to cut imports of Russian oil. Weaning off Russian oil might raise India's import bill, but it won't be \"as big a sticker shock as [it] might have been if crude was in the $70 or $80 range,\" said Hari of Vanda Insights.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were trading around $61.83 a barrel on Friday.Experts also say the benefits of India cutting back on Russian oil purchases outweigh the downsides.According to Natixis' Senior Economist Trinh Nguyen, the arbitrage that Russian oil offered during the energy crisis has tapered off, and there is no need for India now to have significant purchases of Russian oil.watch nowIndia's Russian crude purchase has been a sore point in its trade relations with the U.S., which culminated in the U.S. imposing a total 50% tariff on Indian goods exported to the U.S..With both state-owned and private refiners expected to halt purchase of Russian crude — a long-standing demand of U.S. President Donald Trump — the chances of India negotiating a mutually beneficial trade deal with the U.S. have increased.— CNBC's Ying Shan Lee contributed to this report ",

    "body": "A shopper looks at produce at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Friday release of September's consumer price index report is pretty much the only game in town this month for a Wall Street that is hungry for data, raising the chances for it to be a market-moving event.While the actual numbers are expecting to land about where they've been in recent months, the dearth of official economic reports, thanks to the government shutdown, means even a slight deviation could cause an outsized impact.\"Because we haven't gotten any government data in the recent past, I think all of the market's focus and all of the market's attention is going to be directed onto this one report,\" said Troy Ludtka, senior U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \"This is going to be the report to end all reports.\"As far as the Wall Street consensus goes, though, the CPI release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks to be more of the same.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the monthly all-items reading to increase by 0.4%, the same as a month ago, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%, or 0.2 percentage point higher than the August level. Excluding food and energy, core CPI is projected to show a 0.3% monthly increase and a 3.1% annual level, both the same as in August. The yearly rate would be the highest since January.What the Street will be looking for is any deviation in the readings showing that inflation is running hotter or colder than anticipated. The focus also will be on the details showing what impact President Donald Trump's tariffs are having on prices.The report, which was supposed to be released Oct. 15, will be the last significant economic reading before the Fed's policy meeting that concludes Wednesday. The BLS called workers back because it uses CPI as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.Lack of clarityGoldman Sachs economists expect little change on auto prices, a boost on car insurance and a decline in airfare. On the tariff issue, the firm said in a note that it expects \"upward pressure\" on categories such as communication, household furnishings and recreation, but an addition of just 0.07 percentage point to the core inflation figure.However, data in general is a black box with so much of the government shut down, raising some questions over the reliability of the CPI.\"We don't have full clear clarity with the lack of important data points that the market depends on due to the government shutdown,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"So that adds to the uncertainty a little bit more.\"Indeed, investors have been on tenterhooks lately, pushing major stock market averages to around record territory despite continued fluctuation in day-to-day moves.Geopolitical uncertainty is at the root of concerns, with the ever-shifting tariff landscape injecting worry that higher prices could slow what has been an otherwise surprisingly strong pace of economic growth. The CPI report, despite concerns about how clean the data will be due to shutdown-related disruptions, should help answer at least some of those questions.That applies both to markets and the Federal Reserve, which holds a policy meeting next week at which officials are widely expected to approve another quarter percentage point interest rate cut.\"In terms of market impact, it would take a meaningful surprise to the upside for the market to change its mind about an additional interest rate cut,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.Outside of the trade war's frequent gyrations, markets have been boosted by another strong earnings season. Prior to the lockdown, economic data also had shown a surprisingly resilient economy, with gross domestic product tracking close to 4% for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.While it would take something of consequent to shake that narrative, a surprise from CPI might just be the ticket.\"I would expect volatility if the number comes in higher than expected,\" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at Hightower Advisors. \"I would view that as a buying opportunity as the economy is strong, the Fed is beginning a cutting cycle, EPS are growing double digits and the fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest quarter of the year.\"",

George Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\"Deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,\" Zhao wrote in a post on X.\"Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide,\" he wrote, before adding, \"still in flight, more posts to come.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the pardon, calling it an example of \"corruption.\"\"First, Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge,\" said Warren, who is the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\"Then he boosted one of Donald Trump's crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon,\" she said.\"Today, Donald Trump did his part and pardoned him. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption in pending market structure legislation, it owns this lawlessness.\"Binance, in a statement obtained by NBC News, said, \"Incredible news of CZ's pardon today.\"\"We thank President Trump for his leadership and for his commitment to make the US the crypto capital of the world. CZ's vision not only made Binance the world's largest crypto exchange but shaped the broader crypto movement,\" the company said.Zhao, in November 2023, pleaded guilty in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.Zhao had been charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanction in an intentional effort to profit from the American market without implementing legally required controls, the DOJ said.Binance had been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and conspiracy.He was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail.Federal prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence Zhao to three years in prison.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland blasted Binance when Zhao pleaded guilty.\"Binance became the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history,\" Garland said at the time.Then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the same day, said, \"Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.\"Leavitt, in her statement Thursday, noted that prosecutors had asked for a three-year sentence.\"The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career,\" Leavitt said.\"These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation,\" she said. \"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over.\"Correction: Binance had been charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. An earlier version misstated the name of the act.",

    "body": "An exhibition room at Pop Mart's theme park, Pop Land, in Beijing, on June 18, 2025.Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart fell 9% Thursday, notching the stock's worst day since April and extending its declines since a late-August peak.The company behind the popular Labubu dolls, a series of collectible elf-like monster dolls that come in blind-box packaging, reported on Tuesday that third-quarter revenue had more than tripled year over year as sales in the U.S. swelled between 1,265% and 1,270%.And yet concerns are growing the craze could be fading.Data from Chinese resale platform Qiandao shows that some Labubus are being sold close to or below official Pop Mart retail prices, a stark shift after a period of sky-high demand and prices. The Labubu character Luck, released in April, for example, saw its resale price soar to over 500 yuan, or about $70, at one point. But that's since dropped to 108 yuan, or about $15, according to Qiandao.Since August, Pop Mart stock has fallen 30%, but is still up 159% so far this year.Analysts are split on how to interpret the downturn.One line of thinking is that the falling resale prices could signal slowing enthusiasm for Labubu and other collectibles after a summer peak, particularly among younger, nontraditional toy buyers. Another possibility: The decline may reflect Pop Mart's efforts to increase supply and curb scalping, rather than waning consumer demand.Pop Mart reported a 10-fold increase in the supply of plush toys this year and said it now manufactures approximately 30 million units each month, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley analysts noted in a September client note that \"prices in the second-hand market do not effectively reflect the true supply and demand situation,\" especially given Pop Mart's initiatives to limit resellers' influence.The popularity of the Labubu dolls have been boosted by celebrity fans including singer Rihanna and former soccer star David Beckham. However, Labubus aren't the only Pop Mart product drawing the eye of nontraditional toy buyers.Morgan Stanley analysts noted that emerging characters like Twinkle Twinkle and opportunities for global expansion continue to play a key role in driving Pop Mart's growth.",

    "body": "watch nowProcter & Gamble on Friday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, lifted by higher demand for its beauty and grooming products.Despite higher costs from tariffs and what CEO Jon Moeller called a \"challenging consumer and geopolitical environment,\" P&G reiterated its forecast for all-in sales and earnings for the fiscal year, which began in July.Shares of the company rose 4% in premarket trading.Here's what the company reported for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.99 adjusted vs. $1.90 expectedRevenue: $22.39 billion vs. $22.18 billion expectedP&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.75 billion, or $1.95 per share, up from $3.96 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, including costs associated with incremental restructuring, the consumer giant earned $1.99 per share.Net sales rose 3% to $22.39 billion. Organic sales, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 2% in the quarterThough revenue metrics were higher, P&G's volume was flat compared with the year-ago period. Volume excludes pricing, which makes it a more accurate reflection of demand than sales. Like many consumer companies, P&G has seen demand for some of its products fall as inflation-weary consumers seek out deals.'K-shaped' shopping\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with media, adding that shoppers have behaved similarly in the last few quarters.In the United States, the company's largest market, consumption across P&G's broad swath of products has slowed \"a little bit,\" according to Schulten. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is seeing a bifurcation in how consumers are shopping, based on their incomes, often described as a \"K-shaped\" economy. Shoppers who are less cash constrained are buying bigger pack sizes from mass and online retailers, Schulten said.\"That's their way to look for value,\" he said.But U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck are looking to stretch their money further by using every bottle of detergent or shampoo to the last drop and exhausting their pantry inventory before shopping for more, according to Schulten.Boxes of Tide Pods dishwasher detergent are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on July 12, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesP&G reported Friday that volume for both its health care and fabric and home care divisions, which includes Tide and Swiffer, fell 2% during the quarter.The company's baby, feminine and family care segment reported flat volume for the quarter. That division includes brands like Pampers and Tampax.P&G's beauty business was a bright spot. The division, which includes brands like Olay and SK-II, reported volume growth of 4% and overall sales growth of 6%.And P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette and Venus razors, saw volume rise 1% in the quarter for a sales increase of 5%.For fiscal 2026, the company is now projecting that President Donald Trump's tariffs will result in $400 million in after-tax costs, down from its prior outlook of $800 million. When P&G originally formulated its forecast, it had included retaliatory tariffs on Canada, which have since been rescinded. As a result, the company is now planning to raise prices less than expected, Moeller said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.However, Trump said on Thursday evening that he is terminating all trade talks with Canada over a TV ad, which could mean higher costs ahead for P&G.P&G also reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast of sales growth between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09.",

    "body": "Mustafa Suleyman CEO and co-founder of Inflection AI speaks during the Axios BFD event in New York City, U.S., October 12, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said the software giant won't build artificial intelligence services that provide \"simulated erotica,\" distancing itself from longtime partner OpenAI.\"That's just not a service we're going to provide,\" Suleyman said on Thursday at the Paley International Council Summit in Menlo Park, California. \"Other companies will build that.\"Suleyman's comments come a week after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said his company plans to allow verified adults to use ChatGPT for erotica. Altman said that OpenAI is \"not the elected moral police of the world.\"Microsoft has for years been a major investor and cloud partner to OpenAI, and the two companies have used their respective strengths to build big AI businesses. But the relationship has shown signs of tension of late, with OpenAI partnering with Microsoft rivals like Google and Oracle, and Microsoft focusing more on its own AI services.Earlier on Thursday, Microsoft announced a series of new features for its Copilot AI chatbot, including an AI companion called Mico that can respond to users through a call feature and express itself by changing its color.Suleyman in August penned an essay titled \"We must build AI for people; not to be a person.\" He argued that tech companies should not build \"seemingly conscious\" services that can give humans the impression that they may be capable of suffering, and wrote that conscious AIs could create another \"axis of division\" for humanity.On Thursday, Suleyman said the creation of seemingly conscious AI is already happening, primarily with erotica-focused services. He referenced Altman's comments as well as Elon Musk's Grok, which in July launched its own companion features, including a female anime character.\"You can already see it with some of these avatars and people leaning into the kind of sexbot erotica direction,\" Suleyman said. \"This is very dangerous, and I think we should be making conscious decisions to avoid those kinds of things.\"OpenAI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment, while xAI responded saying, \"Legacy Media Lies.\"WATCH: Why it's time to take AI-human relationships seriouslywatch now",

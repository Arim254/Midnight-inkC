    "body": "American Express announces the new platinum business card.Courtesy: American ExpressAmerican Express is finding that even for a provider of credit cards to the affluent, it pays to focus on the highest of high rollers.The company recently shifted marketing dollars to its refreshed Platinum card, which carries an $895 annual fee, and away from no-fee cash back cards, CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts Friday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.Doing that helps to boost overall spending levels as high-end consumers continue to thrive, a tactic that leads to both rising fee revenue from premium cards and lower loan defaults, executives said.\"We have the ability … to be really flexible with our marketing investments, and we saw a tremendous demand for premium products, particularly the Platinum card,\" Squeri said.\"The overall portfolio is slowly getting more premium [as] the Platinum portfolio is growing at a very fast pace,\" he added.AmEx's strategy shift is the latest example of the so-called \"K-shaped\" U.S. economy playing out, in which wealthy consumers continue to spend freely while others rein in their expenses. Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor said it will report pretax charges of $600 million in its fourth-quarter results due to adjustments in its employee pension plans and other postretirement benefits.The Detroit automaker said the special charges, which will affect its net income but not its adjusted results or cash, are split between domestic plans and those outside the U.S.\"The remeasurement loss for U.S. plans was largely driven by actuarial losses compared to plan assumptions,\" Ford said in a public filing after markets closed Thursday. \"The remeasurement loss for non-U.S. plans was largely driven by changes in key plan measurement assumptions, such as improved life expectancy.\" On an after-tax basis, Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to decrease its net income by about $500 million based on the tax impact in the jurisdictions where there are remeasurement gains and losses.Ford said its retirement plans remain fully funded and the charges would not change its expectations for pension contributions in 2026.The new special charges are in addition to about $19.5 billion in special items the company disclosed last month related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments, most of which Ford said would occur during the fourth quarter.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after markets close on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are seen in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington on Dec. 19, 2025, as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender. Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday is releasing more than 3 million additional pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said.The large release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ was not complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to the notorious sex offender Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Blanche said Friday the DOJ was not releasing the rest of what are more than 6 million total pages identified as potentially responsive to the Epstein Transparency Act.A group of victims of Epstein in a statement blasted the DOJ for what it called the \"incomplete\" release of the files.\"This latest release of Jeffrey Epstein files is being sold as transparency, but what it actually does is expose survivors,\" said the group in a statement obtained by MS Now.\"Once again, survivors are having their names and identifying information exposed, while the men who abused us remain hidden and protected. That is outrageous. As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein's enablers continue to benefit from secrecy. This is a betrayal of the very people this process is supposed to serve,\" the statement said. \"The Justice Department cannot claim it is finished releasing files until every legally required document is released and every abuser and enabler is fully exposed,\" the victims said. \"We need to hear directly from Attorney General Pam Bondi when she appears before the House Judiciary Committee on February 11. Survivors deserve answers, and the public deserves the truth.\"This is not over,\" the women said. \"We will not stop until the truth is fully revealed and every perpetrator is finally held accountable. As we have always said, this is not about politics. We hope Democrats and Republicans will stand with survivors in continuing to demand the full release of the Epstein files.\"Speaking at a press conference at DOJ headquarters in Washington, Blanche said that more than 500 DOJ lawyers and other personnel had spent the past 75 days reviewing potential material related to Epstein and determining what needed to be released under the law.Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference at the Justice Department in Washington, Jan. 30, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\"We're releasing more than 3 million pages today, and not the 6 million pages that we collected,\" Blanche said. \"That means that the department produced approximately 3½ million pages in compliance with the act.\"He said that no more documents would be released. The large release on Friday comes weeks after DOJ released a much-smaller tranche of Epstein-related documents on Dec. 19.\"Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive documentation, document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act,\" Blanche said.Some of the material released relates to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to abuse.

Thompson, 50, was fatally shot on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024, while walking to an investors' event for his company's parent, UnitedHealth Group. The third count accused Mangione of the murder of Thompson through the use of a firearm during that alleged stalking. That count, which the judge tossed out, would have made Mangione eligible for a possible death sentence. The fourth count, which was also dismissed, accused Mangione of the use of a firearm equipped with a silencer during the stalking.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersA federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing trade secrets related to the search company's AI technology.The jury found 38 year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to stealing thousands of pages of confidential information from Google to benefit the People's Republic of China, according to court documents. \"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government,\" said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. \"Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.\"The case marks the first conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. Google executives and U.S. leaders have been vocal about the AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently told CNBC that Chinese AI models might be \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western capabilities.The jury's decision comes after Ding was originally indicted in 2024. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California oversaw the 11-day trial that led to Thursday's decision. Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding stole more than 2,000 pages of Google's AI trade secrets and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account, the DOJ said Friday. At the time, Ding had been affiliated with two tech companies based in China and was in the process of creating his own tech company.The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture of Google's custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and the company's graphics processing unit systems, according to the DOJ. The trade secrets also included details about Google's custom-built SmartNIC, a specialized network interface card that enables high-speed communication across its AI supercomputers and cloud networking systems.Ding's attorney Grant Fondo reportedly argued that Google didn't do enough to protect the information. He argued that the documents in question were available to thousands of employees and therefore could not have contained trade secrets, adding \"Google chose openness over security,\" according to Courthouse News Service.Ding, whose next court date is Tuesday, faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, according to the DOJ.\"We're grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement to CNBC.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stakewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowFormer CNN anchor Don Lemon was arrested by federal agents in connection with his presence at a protest in a Minnesota church against the Trump administration's immigration efforts.Lemon, 59, \"was taken into custody by federal agents last night in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards,\" his attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Friday morning.\"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" Lowell said.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi later Friday morning confirmed the arrests of Lemon and three others, including Georgia Fort, another independent journalist.She also confirmed the arrests stemmed from what she described as \"the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,\" on Jan. 18. Charging documents were not immediately available.Department of Justice officials had publicly vowed to bring charges against Lemon, who has vocally criticized the Trump administration, over his presence at a protest at the church.Lemon, an independent reporter who hosts \"The Don Lemon Show\" on YouTube, has said he was reporting on the protest against immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities. A federal magistrate judge last week reportedly rejected a criminal complaint that was brought against Lemon.In Friday's statement, Lowell called Lemon's arrest an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment\" and a \"transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration.\"\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said. CNN, from which Lemon was fired in 2023, said in a statement that Lemon's arrest \"raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment.\"The White House's official X account mocked Lemon on Friday, sharing an image announcing his arrest below the caption, \"When life gives you lemons...\" and an emoji of chains. Bondi, in a video posted to her social media, later added, \"Make no mistake: Under President Trump's leadership and this administration, you have the right to worship freely and safely. And if I haven't been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.\"",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle at a dealership in Colma, California, Jan. 23, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — American consumers are hitting a fork in the road when it comes to the U.S. automotive industry. Affluent buyers are purchasing new vehicles at increasingly higher prices, while lower-income ones are continuing to drive used models.This trend is a growing concern for auto executives and feeds into worries that U.S. consumers are facing a \"K-shaped\" economy, where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.\"We have a different vehicle buyer today than we had just a few years ago,\" Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said Thursday during an auto analyst event. \"The key takeaway here is that we're seeing the average buyer here is much more affluent.\"Cox reports that the share of new-car buyers with incomes of less than $100,000 has dropped from 50% in 2020 to 37% last year, representing millions of lost sales. On the other end of the spectrum, the share of buyers with incomes of more than $200,000 has grown from 18% to 29% during that timeframe.The shift has occurred as MSRP, or manufacturer's suggested retail price, hit an average of $51,000 in 2025, according to Cox, and as buyers are also dealing with higher insurance costs and inflation. Consumer sentiment, meanwhile, is at recessionary levels.New-car sales were at record levels of more than 17 million prior to 2020 but have experienced mixed results since, ending 2025 with 16.3 million sales. Brand-new vehicles have never been for the majority of U.S. consumers, but automakers have increasingly been pricing millions of Americans out, including by cutting entry-level vehicle lines such as small cars.\"We're now relying on the extremely wealthy to generate the sales,\" Mark Barrott, a partner at consulting firm Plante Moran, said during the Thursday event. \"That's a structural problem from an affordability perspective.\"Barrott said U.S. sales aren't hitting records but that they're still pretty good compared with historical levels. Automotive executives may begin taking more notice if the market conditions shrink due to buyers getting priced out, he added.\"It's not unrealistic to think that in the next two or three years we could get to that kind of level, and then this really starts to hurt the [automakers],\" he said.A modeling study by Plante Moran found a third of the U.S. population can't afford new vehicles, with very limited choices for those who may be on the fence. There are roughly 110 \"affordable\" models, in relative terms, for household incomes of $65,000 or less compared with more than 250 \"affordable\" models for those with incomes of up to $105,000, according to the study.The median household income in the U.S. was $83,730 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That has risen 24% since 2020, when it was $67,521.U.S. average transaction prices for new vehicles, meanwhile, were hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.CarMax's Edmunds this month reported new-car buyers are increasingly spending more per month on the purchase of a new vehicle, with a record of 20% committing to average monthly payments of more than $1,000 during the fourth quarter of last year.Ford CEO Jim Farley earlier this month warned the U.S. automotive industry needs to be mindful of affordability concerns leading to consumer pullback. While producing larger, more expensive vehicles can be more profitable for automakers, it can shrink the market and lower sales. \"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"Read more CNBC auto newsAuto executives are hoping for the best and planning for the worst in 2026GM expects to top Ford in U.S. vehicle production as it faces up to $4 billion in tariff costsStellantis stock off 43% as Jeep maker turns five, executes turnaroundEV realism is here.

Denis Balibouse | ReutersGold and silver prices plunged Friday, as President Donald Trump's nomination for the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, appeared to relieve concerns about the central bank's independence and sent the dollar soaring. Spot silver was down 28% at $83.45 an ounce, trading near its lows of the day. Silver futures plummeted 31.4% to settle at $78.53, marking its worst day since March 1980.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silverMeanwhile, spot gold shed around 9% to trade at $4,895.22 an ounce. Gold futures dropped 11.4% to settle at $4,745.10.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot goldThe sharp moves down were initially triggered by reports of Warsh's nomination. However, they gained steam in afternoon U.S. trading as investors who piled into the metals raced to book profits. Metals were also under pressure as the dollar spiked higher, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy gold and silver and spoiling the theory that metals would replace the greenback as the globe's reserve currency. The dollar index last traded around 0.8% higher. \"This is getting crazy,\" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. \"Most of this is probably 'forced selling.' This has been the hottest asset for day traders and other short-term traders recently. So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out.\"Trump picks WarshNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days. In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said the market was \"trading Warsh hawkish.\"\"The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower,\" the firm's vice chairman said.\"But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker.\"Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday that a \"perfect storm\" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets. \"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,\" Wewel said, prior to Trump's announcement. 'Even good assets can sell-off'Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 66% and 135%, respectively, over the course of the year.Coeur Mining lost 17%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen more than 62% lower. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds were headed for their worst days on record. Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely \"a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.\" \"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,\" she said. \"When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.\"Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened \"too easily.\" He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. \"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,\" he said. \"The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.\"",

    "body": "watch nowChevron CEO Mike Wirth said Friday that Venezuela has taken positive steps to protect investment by private oil companies since the Trump administration captured former President Nicolás Maduro.Venezuela on Thursday passed reforms to its hydrocarbon law that ease state control of the oil industry and grants private producers more autonomy. Wirth said Chevron is still reviewing the legislation. The CEO said security of contracts, commercial stability and regulatory predictability are key to attract investment in Venezuela. \"We see Venezuela taking steps in a positive direction to address those issues, which will encourage investment, not only from a company like ours, but from others that I think are also considering the opportunities there,\" Wirth told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" in an interview. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Treasury Department. It is currently producing about 250,000 barrels per day through joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. Wirth said Friday that Chevron could increase production in Venezuela by up to 50% over the next 18 to 24 months if the company receives authorization from the U.S. government.Wall Street largely views Chevron as the U.S. oil company best positioned to benefit from the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela due to its presence in the country and its relationship with PDVSA. \"We've stayed when others didn't,\" Wirth said. \"We're getting paid back some debts that we're owed, and it does give us a significant head start. And the country has tremendous long-term potential.\"The CEO said the security situation is mostly stable where Chevron operates though there are areas of Venezuela that are less safe. \"We've got good, strong safety protocols and security protocols in place in the country,\"  Wirth said. \"And our operations have continued uninterrupted through this entire period of time.\"Chevron reported fourth-quarter earnings on Friday that beat estimates. The oil major increased production in 2025 by 12% worldwide and 16% in the U.S. to record levels.While Chevron is ready to ramp up production, competitor Exxon Mobil is wary of returning to Venezuela after its assets were seized twice in the past. Exxon CEO Darren Woods has called the country uninvestable. He told CNBC on Friday that the country needs to transition to democracy for investment to make sense.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Chevron shares were trading up 1.4% after reporting its results. The stock has gain nearly 14% since the start of the year, outpacing the broader market. ",

    "body": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is on the launch pad carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet network satellites, which are expected to eventually rival Elon Musk's Starlink system, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 9, 2025.Steve Nesius | ReutersAmazon has asked the Federal Communications Commission for more time to meet a deadline that requires the company to deploy roughly 1,600 internet satellites by July 2026. The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. government partially shut down early Saturday, despite the Senate passing a funding deal hours earlier.The Senate — by a vote of 71-29 — approved a package of five bills, plus a two-week stopgap measure that gives lawmakers more time to work out disputes over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.But the House of Representatives must also vote to approve the final version of the deal, and it isn't scheduled to return to Washington until Monday. So the federal government entered what is likely to be a short shutdown, following the record 43-day shutdown last year.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on a House GOP conference call earlier Friday afternoon that he will back the Senate-passed funding deal in light of President Donald Trump's support for it, MS NOW reported. Johnson said he hopes the House will pass the bill Monday, according to MS NOW. Once it is approved by the House, the spending package will be sent to Trump to sign.Congressionally approved appropriations expired on Saturday for bills funding the Departments of State, Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Housing and Urban Development and related agencies and programs.U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, in a memo sent Friday, told federal agency heads that their employees \"should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities.\"\"The Administration will continue working with the Congress to address recently raised concerns to complete appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026,\" Vought wrote.\"It is our hope that this lapse will be short,\" he added.The Senate agreement stripped out funding for the Department of Homeland Security and included five other bills to appropriate money for government agencies.The deal called for DHS, which has been the target of scathing criticism by Democrats over its aggressive immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, to be temporarily funded by a stopgap measure, with the question of long-term funding to be revisited later.The deal had stalled in the Senate as a few Republican holdouts kept lawmakers from quickly considering the package.South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham earlier Friday refused to lift the hold he placed on the measure unless he was \"guaranteed a vote\" on his bill to criminalize so-called sanctuary city policies.

That amendment would have required officials to notify senators if their phone records are obtained in a criminal investigation.The House last week included language in the spending package to repeal a law that would have allowed senators to sue for up to $500,000 if their phone records were obtained during Arctic Frost. Graham criticized House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for the move.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Thursday, encouraged lawmakers to support the deal that would fund most of the federal government through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Senate leaders had planned a vote on the agreement for Thursday night, but Graham's hold scuttled that effort.",

    "body": "China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Countries that shunned China during its trade dispute with the U.S. are now sending their leaders to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping — and are keen to strike business deals.At least five national leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, have visited Xi in January alone. Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during an event to announce a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to reduce the prices of GLP-1 weight‑loss drugs, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 6, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.\"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageSenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a \"non-starter.\"The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.In multiple posts on Saturday, Trump also reiterated his calls for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying earlier this week they would not support a change. Trump had called for his party to exercise what he called \"the Nuclear Option\" on the rule.On Saturday, Trump alleged that he is \"making progress\" with Republicans on changing the rule.\"The Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER! Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.\"I don't have notifications,\" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. \"If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.\"He added: \"The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.\"The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.\"When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,\" he said. \"When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.\"Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is \"disrespectful\" and \"wastes time.\"\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said at the time.He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.Working from homeDimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the \"damage\" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.\"Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,\" he said in the recording.\"They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.\"He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. \"And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,\" he added.Work etiquetteAnastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.\"I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,\" Dedyukhina said.That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.",

    "body": "\"My child won't tell me anything about their day!\" It's a common concern I hear from parents in my psychotherapy office. They're hoping to gain a glimpse into their child's world. But asking \"How was school today?\" usually leads to a one-word answer.As a therapist and the author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do,\" I encourage parents to ask questions that are thoughtful and spark meaningful conversations. When kids reflect on their experiences, they practice skills like emotional awareness, problem-solving, and empathy, and develop a growth mindset.Here are seven questions that lead to productive conversations while also helping kids grow mentally stronger:1. 'What was the best part of your day?'This question encourages kids to scan their brains for positives. For children who dislike school or tend to focus on what went wrong, answering this question helps them build optimism and gratitude — which are both protective factors for mental health.Frame the question with your own experience, saying, \"The best part of my day was going for a walk during my lunch break. What about you?\" Your child might share a highlight, like, \"I played kickball at recess.\"2. 'What's a mistake you learned from today?'This one normalizes errors and celebrates healthy risk-taking. Talking openly about mistakes reduces shame and helps kids see them as opportunities for growth.Ask with a tone of curiosity, not judgment: \"Did anything happen today that you'd do differently next time?\" This might prompt them to say, \"I forgot my library book so I'm going to pack it tonight so I don't forget.\"3. 'Who were you proud of today?'It works because it turns their attention to others and cultivates empathy. You will also gain insight into your child's relationships and what they value.Make the question more specific by asking, for example, \"Did you see anyone try really hard at something today?\" Your child may talk about a friend who was brave or might give themselves a pat on the back and say, \"My friend forgot her snack so I shared mine.\"4. 'What's one thing that would have made today better?'This question helps kids identify feelings like frustration and disappointment without dwelling on those experiences. It naturally opens the door to problem-solving and planning.You can ask in a fun way, such as, \"If you had a magic wand to change one thing about today, what would it be?\" This can lead to creative ideas, like, \"I wish there was more time for my art project so maybe I'll bring it home to finish it.\" 5. 'Who did you help today?'You can empower kids to engage in prosocial behavior with questions like this. When you ask regularly, kids begin to look for opportunities to be helpful and acts of kindness become second nature.  Ask about small acts of contribution: \"How were you a helper today?\" They might remember something simple, like, \"I helped the teacher pass out papers.\"6. 'What was the most interesting thing you learned today?'It emphasizes curiosity over academic performance. Showing interest in the learning process itself fuels lifelong learning.Encourage kids to talk about what they learned aside from just their subjects. They may share a fun fact, like, \"I learned that my teacher knows how to play the violin.\" Show interest and ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going.7. 'What's something new you'd like to try?'This nudges kids to look outside their comfort zone and encourages them to be courageous. They don't have to be good at something in order to try something new — it's a learning experience. If your child hesitates to try new things, encourage an experiment by asking, \"Is there a club or activity you're curious about just trying once?\" They may be more likely to explore if they know they don't have to stick with it forever.Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, clinical social worker and instructor at Northeastern University. She is the author of several books including \"13 Things Strong Kids Do: Think Big, Feel Good, Act Brave\" and \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do.\" Her TEDx talk \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time.

    "body": "Kai Yang Chan (left) and JiaYi Zhou (right) run Singapore-based bakery Cake Inspiration.Courtesy of Cake InspirationWhen Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. Six years later, not only have they tied the knot — they're also business partners.\"I downloaded Tinder because I was very bored in school, so I was just [swiping] through during class,\" said Zhuo. \"Both of us — we didn't expect that we'd get together,\" she said.\"Personality wise, we are quite different,\" she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party.Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It.The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities.A family affairCakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents.\"My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine,\" said Zhuo. \"I was never very studious, but I really like being hands on. So I like to bake, I like to dance. I like to create all these little pretty things,\" she said. From the early days of the business, she often helped with designing cakes.Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. With her parents contemplating retirement, Zhuo knew it was time for her to step in.Courtesy of CakeInspiration\"I [felt] that it's a waste to just let it go. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down,\" she said.In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. She eventually introduced two new brands — Eggyi.Co, which sells bento cakes, or mini, single-serving sized cakes targeted at Gen-Z, and Petissier which sells customised cakes for pets.The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes.Shooting for the starsSimilar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up.\"I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing,\" said Chan. \"Since I was 16, I did my own little startups, selling whatever. [I sold] sneakers, I'd buy them, clean them up and sell them. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it,\" he said.In 2022, he decided to join his wife in the family business full-time. He introduced a new strategy: rather than only selling directly to individual consumers (B2C), he suggested trying to sell to other businesses (B2B) to create a more consistent source of revenue.In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town.A custom made cake for social media influencers, the Ha Sisters, by CakeInspiration.Courtesy of CakeInspirationIn June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake.\"It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... They posted a story of them in a hotel, and I thought: 'Hey, this looks really familiar. I know [which] hotel this is,'\" he said. \"So I just prepared a cake and then we just zoomed down to the hotel.\"Chan and his team quickly made a custom cake for the sisters and timed the delivery to coincide with the end of the Ha sisters' event. \"Of course, after the pop-up, you have to go back to [the hotel to] change, right? Yeah. So [that's when I] went there,\" he said.By chance, his timing was perfect. Just as he arrived at the hotel entrance with the cake in hand, he ran into the sisters — and managed to hand-deliver the surprise. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views.This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more.Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal.\"We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities,\" said Chan.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesDeflation pressures in China eased in October as consumer prices returned to growth after remaining in negative territory for the most part this year, supported by holiday season demand, while declines in wholesale prices also moderated.Data from China's National Bureau of Statistics released Sunday showed consumer price index reading for October at 0.2%, compared with analysts' expectations of zero, or flat growth year on year. October's reading was the strongest since January this year, and the first positive growth in consumer prices since June.On a month-on-month basis CPI also rose by 0.2%, compared with Reuters-polled analysts' expectations of zero growth.Food prices, which have been a drag on the country's CPI, dropped 2.9% year on year. However, prices rose 0.2% over the previous month.Factory-gate deflation eased with prices falling 2.1%, year on year, compared with Reuters' poll estimates for a 2.2% decline, completing three years in negative territory. Month-on-month producer prices rose by 0.1% in October.\"In October, policies aimed at expanding domestic demand continued to take effect, coupled with the boost from the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,\" Dong Lijuan, chief statistician at the urban division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement.Read moreWhile China's steps aimed at reining in price wars and fueling demand seem to have started bearing fruit, with the country's industrial profits in September rising more than 21%, experts warn that Chinese local governments' dependence on tax revenue encourages sustained production, intensifying competition and overcapacity until there are meaningful tax changes.China's manufacturing activity in October declined more than expected, contracting to its lowest level in six months, according to an official survey released Oct. 30. The sub-indexes for production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all deepened their contraction, pointing to a sharp manufacturing slowdown.Chinese producers have been in the throes of demand uncertainty owed to trade tensions with the U.S. this year and weak consumer confidence at home as Beijing struggles with a prolonged housing downturn and headwinds to exports.The country's exports in October unexpectedly contracted, with shipments to the U.S. clocking double-digit declines for a seventh consecutive month, down 25%, customs data released Thursday showed.Going forward, export headwinds could weaken as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to a trade truce during their meeting in South Korea on Oct. 30, defusing a potentially incendiary situation that had stoked worries of a full-blown trade war.China's leadership last month vowed to boost domestic consumption as it laid out the economic roadmap for the next five years. China must \"vigorously boost consumption,\" the meeting readout said, according to a CNBC translation.The leaders elaborated on the need for lifting consumption with calls to balance it with \"effective investment\" and \"adhere to the strategic point of expanding domestic demand.\"—  CNBC's Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "David Ryder | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHigh valuations for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the focus of the market this week, with fears of a potential AI bubble capping investor sentiment. But the view on Wall Street is still that several tech stocks offer strong fundamentals and are delivering rapid, AI-induced growth, justifying their sky-high valuations.The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors find attractive AI stocks displaying  robust long-term growth outlooks.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN) recently impressed investors with its upbeat Q3 results. Accelerating growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit confirmed the Street's faith in Amazon's expansion into artificial intelligence.In reaction to the solid Q3 print and the recently-announced deal with OpenAI, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley increased his price forecast for Amazon to $315 from $300 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $276.Walmsley said that the Q3 performance, OpenAI deal and positive outlook for Amazon's Trainium chips made him more optimistic toward AWS's long-term growth. In fact, the 5-star analyst expects acceleration in AWS revenue growth from 20% in Q3 to 21% in Q4 2025 and 22% in the first quarter of 2026. He expects AWS revenue to rise by 23% to $157 billion in the full year 2026, followed by a 22% increase to $192 billion in 2027 — above the Street's expectations of $154 billion and $185 billion for 2026 and 2027, respectively.\"We believe investors continue to rotate into AMZN shares given a valuation well below its historic ranges and positive news likely to continue into the AWS ReInvent Conference in early December,\" said Walmsley.The analyst's bullish investment thesis is also based on the cost-to-serve improvements in Amazon's retail business, driven by automation in fulfillment centers and an enhanced logistics network.Walmsley ranks No. 103 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.AlphabetThis second stock pick is Google- and YouTube owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with AI driving solid momentum in its cloud business.Impressed by the Q3 performance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet to $340 from $300 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $316 with an \"outperform\" rating on GOOGL.Anmuth highlighted that Q3 marked the first time that Alphabet's quarterly revenue crossed the $100 billion mark. The top-rated analyst noted Alphabet's robust performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth across every major business.Interestingly, Anmuth believes that Q3 results and favorable insights on AI search formats could change investors' views toward Google's AI search transition. Alphabet noted AI-induced acceleration in query growth and paid clicks, while Anmuth noted that industry conversations indicate that paid clicks using Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM) features are driving higher conversion rates.\"Overall, the AI search transition has been viewed as the greatest risk to Google, but additional signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat will continue to flip the narrative,\" said Anmuth.The analyst is also encouraged by the surge in Google Cloud's backlog to $155 billion. He contends that the figure doesn't include all the gains from the recently announced expansion of GOOGL's partnership with Anthropic, implying a further increase in the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter. Overall, Anmuth is confident about Alphabet's prospects and said it remains JPMorgan's Top 2 idea, behind only Amazon.Anmuth ranks No. 113 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 22%. See Alphabet Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Advanced Micro DevicesThe third tech giant this week is chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which delivered strong results in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. AMD attributed stronger earnings and revenue to its expanding compute business and fast-growing AI data center segment.In reaction, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy increased his price target for AMD to $280 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. With a price target of $285, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AMD stock.Roy noted that AMD's Q3 top line was driven by strength across the company's data center, AI, server and PC businesses. The 5-star analyst highlighted management's optimism toward continued momentum in Q4 FY25, with revenue expected to grow 25% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. AMD expects Q4 revenue growth will be supported by strong performances in its data center, client and embedded businesses, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the gaming segment.Interestingly, Roy believes that AMD's performance in the near-term is being fueled more by increasing demand for server central processing units and continued share gains in client CPUs rather than data center AI graphics processing units. The analyst expects AMD's data center AI GPU business to increase to a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion in FY25, versus a prior estimate of $5 billion.\"Looking ahead, we continue to believe that AMD is executing well as the company nears production shipments of the MI400/450 series GPUs and the Helios rack next year,\" Roy said.The analyst is also optimistic on AMD's recently-announced deals with OpenAI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, saying they provide clarity on the longer-term growth outlook in its data center AI business. Roy awaits further insights from AMD about its technology roadmap and total addressable market (TAM)  at an upcoming Analyst Day event on November 11.Roy ranks No. 20 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 34.4%. See AMD Statistics on TipRanks.",

    "body": "\"Neighbors need food NOW,\" the homepage of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana reads.Amid uncertainty around SNAP funding, food banks across the U.S. are scrambling to pick up the slack for the 42 million Americans who rely on the program for food assistance.SNAP payments have been paused since Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the program by Nov. 7. The administration quickly appealed the ruling and on Friday sought an emergency block on the order.While the larger legal battle continues, several states have said that they've started to process full food stamp payments, the New York Times reports.CNBC Make It spoke with leaders at several food banks about how they're responding to the challenges caused by SNAP cuts and the government shutdown.Brian Greene, the president and CEO of Houston Food Bank, describes the situation as \"a rolling disaster.\"SNAP payments are typically distributed on a staggered monthly schedule in Texas, Greene says, which means that each day since the beginning of November, another 125,000 Texans run out of EBT funds.As the shutdown drags on, a growing number of furloughed federal workers in Houston are turning to food banks for assistance, Greene says.\"Every day that this keeps going, the damage gets worse and worse,\" he says.Facing 'a great increase in need'According to Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, the effects of the SNAP disruption are already becoming clear.Within its service area of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, more than 168,000 people rely on CalFresh, the state of California's version of SNAP, Bacho says.On Monday alone, over 1,500 unique users visited the bank's online food locator tool, which connects people to nearby food distribution sites, according to Bacho. That's nearly double the usual volume.Their hotline has also experienced a 200% increase in requests for referrals, she says.\"We're in the process of ordering additional food and really trying to ramp up for what we think will be a great increase in need,\" Bacho says.Jon Toups, the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana, says his organization was \"stretched thin\" even before the SNAP delays.The Louisiana legislature has stepped in to help provide reserve funds for SNAP users, he says, but USDA cuts earlier this year had already caused supply shortages for food banks.There's \"no question\" that there's been an uptick in demand for food assistance in the past week, Toups says, and \"we're seeing an awful lot of anxiousness.\"For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine, Toups says, creating an even larger chasm of need for banks to fill.\"The shutdown is putting an additional strain on the food bank network when we can least afford it,\" he says.How food banks are respondingAbout 425,000 Houston households rely on SNAP, Greene says, and in order to meet their typical level of need, Houston Food Bank would have to double its output.They're currently using all available resources — Greene gave the bank's procurement team the go-ahead to \"spend what [they] need to spend\" — in an effort to increase output by about 50%.Right now, Houston Food Bank is in \"disaster response mode,\" Greene says.They've set up special distribution sites specifically targeting federal employees and SNAP users in parking lots across the city, including at Houston's NRG Stadium.Houston residents line up in their cars for a special free food distribution by the Houston Food Bank at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025.Mark Felix | AFP | Getty ImagesIt costs around $15,000 to set up one of these \"supersites,\" according to Greene, and they're \"pulling in more volunteers and paying a lot of extra expenses,\" he says.At Second Harvest Food Bank South Louisiana, Toups requested to use a \"pretty significant\" amount of the bank's reserve funds to purchase more food, he says.He's also working to spread the word about the food bank's situation.\"Our community has really stepped up. We've seen an uptick in donations, not only financially speaking, but with their time, which is a huge piece for us,\" he says.Still, staff are \"overrun right now,\" he says: \"I almost feel like I'm asking them to work 24/7 right now to stay out in front of this.\"\"We will always do the best we can do,\" Toups says, but their current situation \"is not sustainable.\"Second Harvest Silicon Valley is in \"drop everything mode\" working to allocate 15% more food to each of their distribution sites, Bacho says.Crucially, while the charitable food system is already \"very, very strained,\" the last thing Bacho wants is for people in need to worry that banks will run out of food.\"Whether that involves going into our reserves, whether it involves raising more from our community or from our greater partnerships with our counties, we're going to do everything we can to meet that increase in need,\" she says.Still 'just at the beginning' of crisisBoth Toups and Greene liken the current situation to the aftermath of a natural disaster — but in those situations, \"the federal government was there to help,\" Greene says.\"In this case, the federal government is the cause, not the solution,\" he says.Right now, local giving is keeping many food banks and aid organizations afloat, according to Greene.\"If philanthropy holds up, we can keep doing this for quite some time,\" he says, but \"in a crisis, philanthropy shoots up, but it comes right back down.\"There are a few ways that people can support food banks right now, according to Toups.Primarily, food banks need monetary donations. That's the \"most efficient\" way to help, he says, \"because it allows me to actually use that money to go do exactly what's needed at that moment in time.\"Volunteers can also help food banks with tasks like sorting donations, packing boxes and distributing food, he says.At the end of the day, though, \"we've got to get back to some level of normalcy,\" Toups says.Right now, \"we're just at the beginning of this crisis,\" according to Bacho. As more days pass without SNAP funding, the demands on food banks will only increase, she says.\"We need this man-made problem in Washington, D.C. to resolve itself,\" Toups says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms. I think what I care more about these days is the charming architecture. I don't want it to be overwhelming in terms of square footage. I want it to be in a really beautiful neighborhood where I feel safe. I want to look outside and see nature,\" she says.\"I don't see a reason to settle for something else, so for us it's a as long as it takes kind of thing.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "MIAMI, FLORIDA - OCTOBER 31: A 'We Accept (Food Stamps)' sign hangs in the window of a grocery store on October 31, 2025 in Miami, Florida. The food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), may run out of funding on November 1st due to the federal government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. In Miami-Dade County, nearly one in six residents receives food assistance. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday night temporarily paused a federal judge's order that directed the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits to 42 million Americans for November by the end of the day.The move came hours after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston denied the administration's emergency request to halt the order relating to food stamp benefits to primarily low-income people.But the appeals court also said it would soon rule on whether the administration was entitled to a stay of the order by U.S. District Court in Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell while its appeal of the order plays out.Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in the order on Friday night in favor of the administration, pushed the 1st Circuit to quickly determine whether to issue that stay.\"The applicants assert that, without intervention from this Court, they will have to 'transfer an estimated $4 billion by tonight' to fund SNAP benefits through November,\" Jackson wrote.That money was to come from so-called Section 32 funds that the Trump administration said it did not want to use to augment a partial payment of SNAP benefits that federal officials planned to make. The partial benefits payment would come from $4.6 billion in contingency funds set aside by Congress for that purpose.The administration originally planned not to pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the ongoing government shutdown.\"Given the First Circuit's representations, an administrative stay is required to facilitate the First Circuit's expeditious resolution of the pending stay motion,\" Jackson wrote.She said that the Supreme Court's stay \"will terminate forty-eight hours after the First Circuit's resolution of the pending motion, which the First Circuit is expected to issue with dispatch.\"That two-day window would give time for the Trump administration, or plaintiffs in the case, to return to the Supreme Court to challenge any ruling by the 1st Circuit.It is not clear to what extent Jackson's order will affect payments of SNAP benefits.The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier Friday told states it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with McConnell's order, even as the administration appealed the ruling.The USDA's memo did not suggest that the administration would renege on that plan even if a higher court blocked the order.The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on Jackson's order, said, \"This decision is a tragedy for the millions of Americans who rely on SNAP to feed their families.\"\"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration chose to fight this in court instead of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people,\" said James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in another pending lawsuit seeking for force full SNAP benefits to be paid.\"Every day the federal government delays is another day that children, seniors, and families face real pain and suffering,\" Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageSenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration last week said it would not pay any SNAP benefits in November because of the federal shutdown, which began on Oct. 1 when Congress failed to pass a bill to provide short-term funding for federal programs, including food stamps. Past administrations have paid the benefits during other shutdowns.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of cities, unions, nonprofits, and a retailer, then sued the administration in Rhode Island federal court, asking McConnell to order that full benefits be paid for the month.McConnell on Oct. 31 ordered the administration to disburse at least partial SNAP benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund.He also ordered the administration to explore whether other pools of previously appropriated money could be used to fully fund SNAP, which costs about $8 billion per month.The administration on Monday said it would pay 50% of SNAP benefits in November by using the contingency funds. But it refused to use another $4 billion from a Section 32 fund that would have made up the difference in the SNAP payments. The administration two days later said a re-calculation found it could pay 65% of the SNAP benefits from the contingency fund.The plaintiffs then urged McConnell to order the administration to make the full SNAP payments from available funds. The judge did so on Thursday, saying at a hearing that the administration's decision to rule out Section 32 funds was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, he wrote in an order.The administration on Friday morning asked the 1st Circuit appeals court to block McConnell's order, even as the USDA issued its memo to states saying that it intended to comply with the ruling.On Friday night, a three-judge panel on that appeals court denied the administration's request.The panel noted that \"the government has not disputed that it may under [federal law] use the Section 32 fund to cover the provision of SNAP benefits for\" November.But the panel also said that the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] remains pending, and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on Nov. 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk that could mark a turning point in how many people can access their costly blockbuster obesity drugs. Under the agreements, Medicare will start covering GLP-1s for obesity for certain patients for the first time beginning in mid-2026 – a shift that will open access to millions of older adults and could spur more employers and other private insurers to follow suit, some experts said. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also lowering the prices that all state Medicaid programs will pay for GLP-1s, but it's up to states to opt into coverage. Obesity drug coverage among state Medicaid plans, employers and other private insurers remains spotty due to the $1,000 or more monthly list prices of existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy. The limited insurance coverage has blocked out patients who can't afford their hefty price tags. That lack of access has led to mounting pressure on health plans and the government to expand coverage — and the government agreements with drugmakers could mark a major shift.\"I think it'll start with the government, start with Medicare, and the insurers will quickly follow,\" Nick Fabrizio, an associate teaching professor in Cornell's health policy program, told CNBC. \"I do think that's coming.\"\"This is a great step towards trying to address a chronic and serious issue, and for those patients who may feel like they have no hope,\" he said.Roughly 8 to 9 million people in the U.S. are using GLP-1s, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said at a briefing with reporters on Thursday. The added Medicare coverage under the deal could bring in as many as 40 million new eligible patients, and prompt more commercial plans to cover the medicines, he said.The deals could also address the inability of many patients with limited or no insurance coverage for obesity drugs to access them, by offering the treatments at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx.gov. The monthly out-of-pocket cost of existing injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has. Still, there is a law prohibiting Medicare from covering weight loss drugs, so any changes would have to come from Congress. Eli Lilly's Ricks told reporters Thursday that for now, the government will launch an initial pilot program in the spring of 2026 under a temporary legal mechanism. It would be voluntary for Medicare prescription drug plans, so \"it may be possible that a few plans do not participate, but I would expect almost all do,\" he said. But Ricks said that it will transition into a formal so-called Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation pilot program in 2027, which means it will be mandatory for all Medicare Part D plans.\"So we expect broad coverage in all plans both in 2026 and beyond,\" he said.Medicare coverage could be a sea changeLikely the most notable feature of the deals is Medicare coverage of obesity drugs, as it will allow the treatments to reach new patients in the program and could lead to broader private insurance coverage. Under the deals, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk agreed to cut the price Medicare and Medicaid pay for GLP-1s to $245 per month. In Medicare specifically, certain patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. People who qualify include patients with a body mass index of 27 or above with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease; people with a BMI of 30 or more with related health conditions; or those with severe obesity, or a BMI of 35 and above. GLP-1s for weight loss are approved for a broader population: people who have obesity or are overweight with one related condition. In a note Thursday, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger also said it's unclear whether the government will allow patients to stay on a GLP-1 for obesity after their BMI levels drop. Even with those restrictions, \"I think in practice, it's still going to cover a fair number of people,\" said Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the eligibility criteria mean 80% of the obese population in Medicare could receive coverage for GLP-1s, despite the limits.\"Today's deal will open up meaningful access to obesity drugs,\" Schott said in a note about Eli Lilly on Thursday. Lakdawalla added that while there isn't clear evidence that private insurers will expand coverage on the heels of government plans, \"it's just optically harder for them to continue to constrain coverage when Medicare and Medicaid are covering them.\" \"That's going to exert some pressure for commercial coverage of these drugs to expand as well,\" Lakdawalla said. Coverage for GLP-1s for obesity has ticked up slightly, but remains sparse: A May survey of more than 300 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans found that 36% provided coverage for GLP-1s for both weight loss and diabetes, up from 34% in 2024. Medicaid, direct-to-consumer offerings could fill gapsLakdawalla said the direct-to-consumer offerings under the deal could be useful for people who are underinsured, uninsured or may not have coverage for obesity medicines. Still, it's unclear how many more patients the drugs will reach due to the offerings. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have introduced lower cost options for their drugs for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump will give those patients even bigger discounts.On TrumpRx, the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior Trump administration officials. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both offered some GLP-1s on their direct-to-consumer platforms for up to $450 to $500 per month.Starting doses of obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk — expected to hit the market next year — will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid.  Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.In terms of Medicaid, Cornell's Fabrizio said states will likely want to start covering obesity drugs at the lower price point, \"but the question is how will they pay for it?\"Around a dozen state Medicaid programs cover obesity drugs, according to 2024 estimates from KFF, a health policy research organization. While GLP-1s offer substantial health benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries, state programs are already facing constrained budgets and administrative demands.Fabrizio added that raising taxes to cover the drugs \"could be a sticky issue.\"Still, JPMorgan's Schott said offering lower prices to Medicaid programs could lead to a \"significant increase in coverage\" in that channel, where Zepbound has very limited uptake. ",

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNearly 7,000 U.S. flights were delayed and more than 2,000 were canceled on Saturday amid across-the-country air traffic controller staffing shortages, and the country's airlines will have to cut hundreds more flights in the week ahead if Congress can't come to a solution to end the government shutdown — now the longest in U.S. history.Trump administration officials last week ordered airlines to start cutting flights at 40 busy U.S. airports on Friday, blaming \"increased reports of strain on the system from both pilots and air traffic controllers\" in large part due to the shutdown.Late Friday, Senate Republicans rejected a Democrat proposal to reopen the government.\"Due to the prolonged government shutdown and nationwide air traffic control staffing shortages, we, like most airlines, are experiencing additional and widespread delays and cancellations across the country today despite the advanced cancellations that the FAA required us to make,\" American Airlines said in a notice to customers Saturday. \"We, again, urge leaders in Washington, D.C., to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown.\"Air traffic controllers, along with airport security screeners, are required to work during the shutdown without receiving their regular paychecks. Federal workers will miss their second full paycheck on Monday, according to their union. Some controllers have taken second jobs to make ends meet, union officials have said.Almost 2,200 U.S. flights were canceled on Saturday as of 9:30 p.m. ET, about 7% of the day's schedule, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Around a third of that number was canceled early in the day, on par with a day of severe thunderstorms, which can be disruptive, though they're routine. Cirium said Friday ranked as the 72nd worst for cancellations since Jan. 1, 2024.Under the FAA's order, the flight cuts will increase to 6% of schedules, 8% by Thursday and 10% next Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News on Friday that cuts could eventually reach up to 20% of schedules, although he didn't elaborate. Airlines weren't required to cut international flights.watch nowThe disruptions are occurring at a generally low travel season, but the key Thanksgiving holiday weekend is less than three weeks away. The impact for airlines could quadruple given how fares during that high-demand period spike, Seaport Research Partners airline analyst Daniel McKenzie said in a note on Friday.Airlines this week waived date-change fees for travelers on affected flights and noted they can also request a refund. Airline executives stated that many customers were being rebooked on alternative flights, while last-minute changes sent others scrambling for other arrangements. Hertz, for example, stated on Thursday that, when the FAA made its flight-cut announcement, one-way car rentals increased by 20% over the same two-day period a year earlier.Delays rose throughout the day Saturday, with more than 6,700 late-arriving U.S. flights, according to FlightAware. Air traffic control staffing shortages prompted delays at major airports including Delta Air Lines hub Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, United Airlines hubs Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and at  Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a busy American hub, as well as Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Here are the airports where the FAA and DOT cuts apply:Impacted airports:ANC - Anchorage InternationalATL - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta InternationalBOS - Boston Logan InternationalBWI - Baltimore/Washington InternationalCLT - Charlotte Douglas InternationalCVG - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky InternationalDAL - Dallas LoveDCA - Ronald Reagan Washington NationalDEN - Denver InternationalDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth InternationalDTW - Detroit Metropolitan Wayne CountyEWR - Newark Liberty InternationalFLL - Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood InternationalHNL - Honolulu InternationalHOU - Houston HobbyIAD - Washington Dulles InternationalIAH - George Bush Houston IntercontinentalIND - Indianapolis InternationalJFK - New York John F.

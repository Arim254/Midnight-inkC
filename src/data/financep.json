    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares rose 20% in afternoon trading.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

Analysts expected 138 million DAUs.Roblox announced in its letter to shareholders that it no longer plans to issue annual guidance starting in 2027 due to \"inherent variability\" in the company's business. Instead, Roblox said it will focus on providing quarterly guidance. Roblox has faced criticism for putting underage users at risk, with multiple lawsuits on behalf of children who were sexually exploited on the gaming platform.The company said that late in the fourth quarter it began a mandatory age check for users looking to access communication features in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Roblox said 60% of its daily users in those markets had age checked while 45% of global daily users had done so.Roblox said the age-check rollout, which was completed globally in January, has caused \"a mid-single-digit headwind to engagement growth and a low-single-digit headwind to bookings growth.\" But the company added that \"the strategic upside is significant.\"\"Accurate age data unlocks a long-term opportunity to tailor features and content, increasing safety and civility, which in turn drives organic engagement growth,\" the company wrote.Roblox said it has found that the age checking has revealed its user base is younger than indicated by self-reported data. Among daily users, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, 35% are under the age of 13 and 27% are over 18. The company said it views its scale with young users as a \"valuable strategic asset.\"WATCH: Gaming stocks plunge on news of Google AI gaming toolwatch now",

Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesToyota Motor announced Friday that Chief Executive Officer Koji Sato will step down and be replaced by its Chief Financial Officer, Kenta Kon, marking the automaker's second CEO transition in three years.The leadership shakeup will take effect on April 1, with Sato assuming the position of vice chairman and a newly created role as chief industry officer. \"Under this new leadership structure, Sato will focus on the broader industry, including Toyota, as Vice Chairman and CIO, while Kon will focus on internal company management as President and CEO,\" the company said in a statement. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kon likened the switch to Sato becoming \"captain of the national team\" and Kon the \"club captain.\" Sato explained the change was made so he could focus on leveraging his new roles as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association and as vice chair of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business lobby. Sato had been appointed CEO in 2023, succeeding longtime leader Akio Toyoda. Executive Vice President Yoichi Miyazaki will assume Kon's former position as CFO. Meanwhile, Toyota plans to make further board changes in June 2026, with Kon joining as a director and Sato resigning from the board.Profit outlook raisedToyota added that the leadership changes will help speed up decision-making amid industry challenges and accelerate its transformation into a more diversified mobility company.Sales revenue for the December quarter rose 8.6% from a year earlier to 13.46 trillion yen ($85.8 billion), beating LSEG SmartEstimates by about 10%. The estimates are weighted toward forecasts from analysts with stronger historical accuracy.Operating income fell 2% to 1.19 trillion yen, reflecting continued pressure from U.S. tariffs. The result still topped LSEG's mean estimate of 1.09 trillion yen.Shares were trading up 1.5% on Friday following the news.Toyota has been increasing its focus on electrified vehicles, including EVs and hybrids, amid tough global competition.The company said Friday that electrified vehicles accounted for nearly half of its retail vehicle sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Sales were driven by strong demand for hybrid vehicles in regions such as North America and China.Toyota raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 11.8%, citing a weak yen and cost reductions to help offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.",

    "body": "Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | APThe stock of Hims & Hers fell Friday after a legal threat from Novo Nordisk.The online teleheath company announced on Thursday plans to launch a cheaper, copycat version of Novo's weight loss pill, prompting Novo to take legal action.Hims stock spiked as much as 15% on the news in Thursday trading, but quickly pared gains and ended the session down 3.8% at a 12-month low after Novo said the action was \"illegal.\" Shares fell as much as 10% more on Friday before paring losses. It was last trading about 2% down. Hims said it will launch a Wegovy-style pill containing the same active ingredient as the original brand, semaglutide, for as little as $49 for the first month when customers sign up for a subscription. After the first month, the price will rise to $99. That's significantly lower than the $149 Novo Nordisk sells its starting dose for on its direct-to-consumer website NovoCare. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHims & Hers stock has been volatile over the past year.Hims is launching its pill even though semaglutide has patent protection in the U.S. until 2032. The telehealth firm's business flourished when it started selling compounded semaglutide in an injectable format, using a loophole in U.S. regulation that allows competitors to sell a drug protected by intellectual property laws if the drug is in short supply.In the early days of the Wevovy jab, demand significantly outstripped supply, but Novo Nordisk has since invested heavily in manufacturing capacity and resolved the supply issues. There are no shortages reported for the pill version.Hims says that its versions are \"personalized\" in dosage, and therefore legal. Novo says the action is illegal and a risk to patient safety. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement Thursday.Hims is a volatile stock, inherently tied to its perceived ability to sell weight loss drugs like its Wegovy copy. Shares have hit highs of $69 and lows of roughly $21 in the past 12 months.Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny, who rates Hims stock at \"Market Perform,\" suggested the telehealth provider could also consider launching copycat versions of Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs. Lilly didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.Meanwhile, Barclays analyst James Gordon called the $49 Wegovy copy a \"new concern\" for Novo.\"While compounded alternatives may attract cost-sensitive patients in the near term, questions remain about their regulatory sustainability and clinical consistency,\" he added.

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin tumbled toward $60,000 this week as investors reassessed its utility. And while there isn't one clear catalyst driving the bloodbath, one thing is clear: the crypto market is in crisis. \"There's nothing going on in the marketplace that should have necessitated this type of a crash,\" Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, told CNBC. \"And so I think that's made people, frankly, more fearful. ... You have to ask yourself, 'is it over for bitcoin?'\"Bitcoin fell as low as $60,062 on Thursday, bringing it to its lowest level since Oct. 11, 2024. That's more than 52% off from its record high of $126,000 hit in early October 2025.  The previous session marked one of bitcoin's bloodiest ever, with the token shedding more than 15% on the day. Its daily relative strength index fell to 18, putting the asset in extremely oversold territory. As of Thursday, other digital assets like ether and solana were also down 24%  and 26% for the week to date, respectively — a sign investors' confidence in the entire crypto market is faltering.Bitcoin bounces, but losses loom largeBitcoin was rebounding on Friday, with the token last trading at $69,631.97, up more than 9% on the day.But, its recent drawdown has prompted investors to reevaluate its utility, including its role as a digital currency or as a store of value. Simultaneously, institutional appetite for the flagship crypto appears to be waning as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds record outsized outflows, threatening to drive bitcoin deeper into the red. \"This time is markedly different from other bear markets, however, in that it's not in response to a structural blowup,\" Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at crypto market-making firm Wintermute, said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"It's a fundamentally macro-driven deleveraging tied to positioning, risk appetite and narratives rather than systemic failures within crypto itself.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin prices over the past yearOver the past few months, investors have grown increasingly skeptical of efforts to recast bitcoin as \"digital gold,\" or an alternative to traditional safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin is down 28% over the past 12 months, while gold is up 72% during the same period — a testament to the latter's utility as a hedge against macro risks. Conversely, bitcoin has often traded down alongside other risk-on assets such as equities amid periods of high macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, raising doubts about its utility as a safe haven. Nearly a week after Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff announcement on April 2, 2025, bitcoin had fallen about 10% to below $80,000, while the S&P 500 had declined roughly 4%. Separately, investors are also reassessing the extent to which financial institutions, treasury firms and governments are willing to adopt bitcoin — a major catalyst for the token in recent years. Large institutional outflows are mounting as investors brace for bitcoin to go lower, thinning liquidity for the token, according to a recent analyst note from Deutsche Bank.Those outflows are also noticeable among spot bitcoin ETFs in recent months, according to the investment firm. The funds have seen outflows of more than $3 billion in January, in addition to roughly $2 billion last December and about $7 billion last November.Additionally, a swath of Strategy copycats that emerged over the past year or so have slowed or paused their bitcoin purchases amid the digital asset's correction. Finally, traders have acknowledged that longtime efforts to market bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies have largely faded. While Steak 'n Shake and Compass Coffee have rolled out support for bitcoin payments in recent years, initiatives to make the asset a form of payment have largely died, particularly as interest in dollar-pegged stablecoins grows, according to Bitwise's Ryan Rasmussen. \"We're seeing Wall Street adopt stablecoins because it is a fundamental transformation of the way payments work, and bitcoin is just a different asset. It's not meant for that today,\" Rasmussen said, arguing that the token's purpose has evolved from that of a currency to a decentralized, nongovernable store of value. \"I've never paid for coffee or a sandwich with bitcoin, and I never will.\"And beyond those more immediate concerns, investors are also increasingly worried that bitcoin's underlying network could be hacked, driving the token to zero. \"It certainly is a risk that is seeing more attention from investors as they're getting more worried about [it], and I think you're seeing a little bit of that risk priced into bitcoin,\" Rasmussen said.He noted that Bitwise has allocated funds toward efforts to mitigate the threat from quantum computing.Nevertheless, traders' appetite for bitcoin has largely dwindled, denting its price. That's true even as long-time believers are still proudly betting on bitcoin, despite of the charts and the naysayers. \"I believe that the story is intact,\" said Scaramucci, adding that he bought bitcoin for his fund on Thursday. \"But, I don't have a crystal ball. … Who the hell knows?\"",

    "body": "watch nowLow oil prices give President Donald Trump more leverage over Iran, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday, speaking as the two adversaries teeter on the brink of another conflict. \"The world is very well supplied with oil right now, and I think it gives President Trump more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices,\" Wright told CNBC in an interview when asked about the risk of a supply disruption due to tensions with Iran. The oil market is closing monitoring tensions in the Middle East for any sign that crude supplies could be disrupted. U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $63.55 per barrel Friday. Prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, after losing 20% in 2025. Oil market analysts are generally expecting a surplus this year after OPEC+ increased output and as U.S. production remains strong. Trump has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with military action if it does not negotiate over its nuclear program. The president threatened Iran with strikes in January during a mass uprising against the regime, but ultimately refrained. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Muscat, Oman earlier on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\" Iran is an OPEC member and produces more than 3 million barrels per day. Wright expects production in Venezuela to grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day this year, after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro early in January. The U.S. has seized control of Venezuela's oil sales and President Trump is pressuring U.S. companies to rebuild its energy sector.\"It will be a substantial percent of global demand growth this year,\" Wright said of output growth in the South American nation. \"Venezuela is going to be another helpful stabilizer of energy markets.\"",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesReddit shares rose 5% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and gave strong guidance for the start of 2026.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: $1.24 vs. 94 cents expectedRevenue: $726 million vs. $665 million expectedThe company said it expects first-quarter sales to come in the range of $595 million to $605 million, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $577 million. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter are projected to come in between $210 million and $220 million, ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $203 million.Reddit also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program.The company's fourth-quarter revenue rose 70% year over year, while net income was $252 million, up nearly 255% from the same period a year ago.Reddit's sales in the U.S. market came in at $583 million in the fourth quarter, topping analyst estimates of $529 million.The company's global daily active uniques, or DAUq, grew 19% year over year to 121.4 million in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 120 million that Wall Street was expecting.Fourth-quarter U.S. DAUq grew 9% year over year to 52.5 million, slightly ahead of the 52.3 million that analysts were projecting.The company said that logged-in DAUq for the U.S., which refers to users who have registered for Reddit accounts, rose 5% year over year to 23 million. That was slower than the 7% year over year growth Reddit said it recorded during the third quarter when its logged-in DAUq for the U.S. came in at 23.1 million. This is the sixth straight quarter in which Reddit's U.S. logged-in user growth has slowed.Investors have been monitoring Reddit's logged-in DAUq metric because users who have created accounts are more lucrative to the company's online advertising business. These Reddit account holders generally use the platform and engage with other users more frequently than those who may have stumbled into Reddit via Google search, which the company refers to as logged-out DAUq.In an investor letter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company plans to \"phase out reporting on logged-in and logged-out later this year\" because there's now less of a distinction between the two metrics than in the past. That's because the company has been working on features intended to keep both logged-in users and logged-out users glued to the platform, Huffman said.\"As the industry evolves, how we think about our product and users must evolve too,\" Huffman wrote. \"We've historically reported logged-in vs. logged-out users, but as some of our work to streamline onboarding — instant personalization, for example — blurs the line between these states, the distinction between them makes less sense.\"Reddit finance chief Drew Vollero told analysts during an earnings call that the company will continue to report both metrics for the first two quarters of 2026.Regarding the company's data-licensing deals with Google and OpenAI, Huffman said during the earnings call that \"relationships with both companies are very healthy\" and that \"the conversation is shifting from a purely business deal to more of a product partnership.\"\"Specifically, what we're looking for in any relationship like this is can we bring users into the community parts of Reddit,\"  Huffman said. Regarding Reddit's efforts to unify its traditional search tool with its more recent generative AI search feature, Huffman said that the company has learned that \"the GenAI search results will just be better for most queries.\"Unlike traditional search, cutting-edge GenAI search and chat tools excel at providing results that contain \"multiple perspectives from lots of people,\" he said.WATCH: Snap CEO Evan Spiegel discusses social media and well-being.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares were up 7% during trading Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

Elon Musk says it's critical to sustain American democracy. The SAVE America Act voter identification bill emerged this week as a hot topic in hard-line Republican circles and now may advance in Congress next week.The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives next week amid a pressure campaign from right-wing commentators and many in the congressional GOP. It sets up a showdown with Democrats and voting-rights advocates, who say such a proposal could disenfranchise millions of Americans, and with Senate Republican leaders, who are fielding calls to change the filibuster and clear a path to passage.\"America's Elections are Rigged, Stolen, and a Laughingstock all over the World. We are either going to fix them, or we won't have a Country any longer,\" Trump posted to Truth Social on Thursday. The president urged passage of a bill dubbed the SAVE America Act, which would require government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot and proof of citizenship to register to vote.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump posts racist image of Obamas, White House defends it and slams 'fake outrage'Sen.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, in the House and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in the Senate — to \"Jim Crow 2.0.\"According to the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available and 2.6 million Americans lack government-issued photo ID of any kind. Low-income and minority voters are more likely to lack the types of documents that would be required by a national voter ID law, leading to less voting participation by those groups.\"The documentary proof of citizenship provisions would be extremely burdensome for a lot of Americans. Most Americans don't have a driver's license or ID that indicates that they're a U.S. citizen,\" Nicole Hansen, policy counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said in an interview.\"We really view the bill as part of a broader effort by the president and his allies in Congress to sow the seeds to question election results in 2026 that they don't like,\" Hansen said.The general concept of voter ID requirements has broad public support, with voting-rights advocates cautioning the devil is in the details. According to an August 2025 Pew Poll, 95% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats favor voter ID. A 2024 Gallup poll found that 84 percent of Americans support voter ID and 83 percent support proof of citizenship to register to vote. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and documented cases are rare.\"The American people are clear: they support Voter ID and agree that only U.S. citizens should vote in our elections,\" Roy said in a statement Thursday. But with Democrats vowing to block the bill, Senate passage is unlikely. Because of Senate procedural rules and the balance of the power in that chamber, Democratic votes are needed for legislation to advance there.A separate proposal, also introduced by Roy and similarly called the SAVE Act, would have barred noncitizen voting but did not have a voter ID component. Federal law already bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections, but there are provisions for them to vote in some lower-level elections. The House voted 220-208 in favor of the bill in April, with four Democrats in support, but it has not yet gotten a vote in the Senate.That has caused some members to call for eliminating the filibuster as it has been practiced since the 1970s and revert back to a \"standing filibuster\" — made famous by the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" — which requires dissenting members to actively hold the floor in order to block legislation.\"The modern-day filibuster is a perversion of how the Senate was supposed to function. Instead of arguing positions and attempting to pass legislation, it has become a way to avoid doing the work and to block the President's agenda in the name of institutional supremacy, even though most of the senators got elected with help from POTUS,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., one of the most vocal in the House group calling for the passage of a voter ID law, posted to X this week.Luna, during an appearance on Punchbowl News' \"Fly Out Day\" podcast, floated the idea of tacking the SAVE America Act onto larger, must-pass legislation down the line.\"We should nuke what's called the zombie filibuster, which is the ability for Democrats to filibuster it without lifting a finger and that we should require an old-fashioned talking filibuster,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Newsmax this week.But Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has promised a vote on a version of the Republican election bill, expressed skepticism about filibuster reform.\"We will get a vote on the SAVE Act at some point,\" Thune said at a press conference earlier this week. \"With respect to the filibuster, I think we all know where the votes are on that.\"",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

    "body": "Uber signs are seen on cars in Krakow, Poland on October 12, 2025. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesUber on Thursday was ordered to pay $8.5 million to the plaintiff in an Arizona trial that is the first of thousands of lawsuits involving alleged sexual assault and misconduct by drivers on the ridesharing platform.In the lawsuit, Jaylynn Dean alleged that she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023 while returning to her hotel.  The verdict, which was delivered in a U.S. District Court in Phoenix, found Uber liable for apparent agency and lays the groundwork for about 3,000 similar lawsuits nationwide that have been consolidated in federal court. The jury did not find Uber liable for negligence or design defects and the company was not ordered to pay punitive damages.\"This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do,\" a spokesperson for Uber wrote in a statement to CNBC.Sarah London, a lawyer at Girard Sharp who is representing Dean, called the verdict a \"victory\" for the plaintiff in a statement to CNBC and said it \"validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety.\"The company is planning to appeal the decision.The ride-hailing company has said it should not be held liable for the misconduct of drivers, who are classified as contractors on its platform. Last year, the New York Times reported that Uber received over 400,000 sexual assault and misconduct reports between 2017 and 2022, which was far more than the company had disclosed. In a report last August, Uber said serious sexual assault on the platform had fallen by 44%.Uber has taken steps to address safety on the platform and implemented new features, including an in-app emergency button and pin verification. In July, Uber began piloting a program in the U.S. that allows women drivers and riders to opt out of being paired with a man. Ridesharing rival Lyft has also faced lawsuits tied to sexual assault and harassment. watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsAlphabet resets the bar for AI infrastructure spendingSoftware experiencing 'most exciting moment' as AI fears hammer the stocksSnap shares rise on fourth-quarter earnings that beat on salesQualcomm stock sinks as memory shortage drags on forecast",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon shares sunk more than 9% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter alone. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively shed more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as \"sentiment contagion takes hold,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.\"Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,\" he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon shares over the past month'Investors questioning every angle in AI race'Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning.\"We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.\"Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. \"With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment,\" the analysts wrote in a research note. \"We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT.\"Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as \"staggering\" demand for the iPhone. \"The bet is becoming binary,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. \"Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong.\"— CNBC's Annie Palmer and Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Tesla remained a strong contender in Beijing's competitive electric vehicle scene, as the company's China-produced EV sales grew modestly in January from the year before, amid a broader industry slowdown.According to data published by the China Passenger Car Association on Wednesday, January deliveries from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory rose by 9% to 69,129 units, from 63,238 in January 2025.The latest January deliveries places Tesla in third place against other Chinese EV manufacturers. BYD was in the lead at 205,518 shipments, while Geely came in second with 124,252 units, according to the CPCA.Despite the rise in deliveries, there is little indication of an actual growth in demand for Tesla's offerings in China — the world's largest EV market.The company's January delivery figures reflect the total number of shipments from Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which produces the Model 3 and Model Y for domestic and foreign markets in Europe, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.New registrations in January for Tesla passenger vehicles — a proxy for sales — rose slightly in Europe, according to Reuters.Domestic price warTesla has faced stiff competition from a number of Chinese EV brands with more affordable offerings. In a separate report, the CPCA noted that the total sales of Tesla's China-produced EVs fell by 4.8% in 2025 — one of only two manufacturers in Beijing that reported declining annual sales from the year before.At around 235,500 yuan ($33,943), Tesla's base Model 3 sedan costs nearly three times the price of the base model for BYD's Seal, at around 79,800 yuan.Like other automakers, Tesla has sought to maintain its competitiveness in China through aggressive price cuts. According to its Chinese website, Tesla has begun offering five-year 0% interest loans, or seven-year \"ultra-low\" interest rate loans for orders placed before Feb. 28.\"We have [had] really intense price wars that have gone on, although the government and industry have called on automakers to not engage with aggressive pricing strategies,\" Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility, tells CNBC.Despite these involutive price wars, China's EV market has slowed considerably.According to CPCA data, new energy vehicle sales, which include hybrid and battery-powered cars, grew by only 1% year on year in January - a fourth-straight month of slowing growth.The slowdown is projected to continue, as Beijing has slashed support for new EV sales. From Jan. 1, a 5% tax on new energy vehicle purchases was reinstated, after previously being exempted from the full 10% tax for more than a decade. New energy vehicles include battery and hybrid-powered cars.New regulationsTesla's challenges are further compounded by a recent announcement from Beijing which will effectively ban concealed door handles. On Monday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that from Jan. 1, 2027, all door handles on cars sold in the country must have interior and exterior mechanical releases.The announcement follows a spate of high-profile incidents in the U.S. and China, where EV occupants involved in road accidents could not be freed after their vehicles caught fire, as a result of power failures in the door-locking mechanisms.While automakers in China have a decent runway to ensure compliance with the new regulations, it remains to be seen how Tesla will adapt, given that flush door handles were first popularized as a signature design feature on Tesla's minimalist vehicles.Some analysts, like Tu Le, founder and managing director of consulting firm Sino Auto Insights, see China's new car door handle restrictions as likely to pose a \"decent sized headache\" for Tesla.However, Le said, China's new regulations will likely have little impact on most automakers.\"I think for lots of Chinese brands, this new regulation [will not] take them by surprise, because when regulators were drafting the new regulations, they consulted OEMs and industry experts intensively,\" Le added.CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.Correction: This copy has been updated to correctly reflect the name spelling of Abby Tu, principal research analyst from S&P Global Mobility.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026.Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced the launch of TrumpRx — a direct-to-consumer website that is key to his administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. The president said millions of Americans would save money through the platform. But it's still unclear if all patients — particularly those with insurance coverage — will see more cost savings from using that site to buy their medicines than they would through existing methods. TrumpRx targets people who are willing to pay with cash and forgo insurance, which suggests that patients without or with limited coverage may benefit the most. \"You're going to save a fortune and this is also so good for overall health care,\" Trump said at an event Thursday night unveiling the website.The site does not sell drugs directly to American patients, but acts as a central hub that points them to drugmakers that are offering discounts on certain products on their own direct-to-consumer sites, or gives them discount coupons to take to pharmacies. For example, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk were already offering their blockbuster obesity drugs at hefty discounts to cash-paying patients, even before the reductions Trump touted on Thursday.Clicking on the platform's offer for Lilly's popular Zepbound weight loss injection sends consumers to the company's LillyDirect platform, where they can order the treatment and submit prescription details.A screenshot of a Zepbound order on the TrumpRx website.\nPreview\nFilters\nSource InfoIn recent months, Lilly, Novo and at least 14 other drugmakers have negotiated agreements with the Trump administration to participate on the platform and voluntarily sell certain medicines at a discount to Medicaid patients. Those landmark deals are part of Trump's broader \"most favored nation\" policy, which pushes to link U.S. drug prices to the lowest ones abroad.At launch, the site features only medications from the first five companies to strike pricing deals with the administration: AstraZeneca, Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, according to a White House fact sheet. It will list drugs from other companies \"in the coming months,\" the administration said.The platform is the government's latest effort to try to rein in U.S. prescription drug prices, which are two to three times higher on average than those in other developed nations — and up to 10 times more than in certain countries, according to the Rand Corp., a public policy think tank.But TrumpRx \"doesn't seem like it is the only solution\" to that issue for most Americans, said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare Policy at KFF, a health policy research organization. The cash-pay offerings could be better deals for patients without insurance, but it's difficult to assess exactly how many people stand to benefit from TrumpRx, she added. \"If they're able to get a drug covered by their insurance at a relatively affordable copay, then there's not a great upside to using the TrumpRx website,\" Cubanski said. She said people with insurance coverage who buy through direct-to-consumer platforms may also not have their purchases count toward their benefits, which means it doesn't help them meet their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. But Cubanski said there's potential for TrumpRx to be helpful in expanding access to certain drugs at more affordable prices, particularly medicines not covered widely by insurance in the U.S., such as obesity drugs. Medicare will start covering weight loss treatments for the first time later this year as part of the deals Lilly and Novo struck with Trump, but many employers are still hesitant to cover those drugs. Still, many of the other products expected to be listed on TrumpRx are already widely covered through insurance, and some are available as cheaper generics from competing drugmakers. Questions about savingsQuestions remain about how much savings people can expect if they buy their medicines at direct-to-consumer prices. The announced price reductions for certain drugs are framed as steep cuts from their so-called retail list prices. For example, under Novo Nordisk's agreement with the administration, some doses of its diabetes drug Ozempic will be priced at $350 per month on TrumpRx, which is less than half of its roughly $1,000 monthly list price. But those list prices are often far higher than what private insurers and government programs ultimately pay for medicines after rebates, discounts and other concessions, according to researchers at Georgetown's Medicare Policy Initiative. That suggests some payers may already be securing prices comparable to — or lower than — the newly announced discounts on medications under the Trump deals. The Georgetown researchers cited one study that found that average discounts on brand-name drugs in Medicare Part D run around 40% of list prices. Meanwhile, discounts in Medicaid exceed 75%, according to a Congressional Budget Office study. In the private sector, \"we've got insurers and pharmacy benefit managers negotiating lower prices and designing an insurance benefit that enables people to benefit from those price negotiations,\" said KFF's Cubanski. \"My guess is that for most drugs, at least most brand-name medications, people are likely to get a better deal using their insurance rather than purchasing a drug through a direct-to-consumer website,\" she said. Drugs on TrumpRxAt the launch of the site, the administration listed a range of major drugs as available for discounts, with a particular emphasis on popular GLP-1 products:Ozempic injection for diabetes, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,000Wegovy injection for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: Starting at $199 per month, down from around $1,350Wegovy pill for obesity, made by Novo Nordisk: $149 per month for the starting dosesZepbound injection for obesity, made by Eli Lilly: starting at $299 per month, down from $1,086The White House also put an emphasis on cash-pay discounts for fertility drugs like Gonal-F from EMD Serono, which was listed at $168. Dozens of other drugs that companies expected to be be listed on the platform were not as of Thursday night. Those include key treatments from companies including Amgen, Merck and Gilead, among others.In an interview with CNBC at a conference in January, Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner said the company has multiple products on its existing direct-to-consumer platform, which first offered a cash-pay discount on its blood thinner Eliquis. That platform will eventually link to TrumpRx, he said. The company is going to examine ways to put additional products in its portfolio on its own platform, \"where it makes sense,\" Boerner added. He said Bristol Myers is \"aligned with the administration\" on the issue of the U.S. health care system being too complex, and said several middlemen can increase costs. \"What we like about these [direct-to-consumer models], where they make sense from a business standpoint, is you're able to circumvent some of that,\" Boerner said. Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview with CNBC last week, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said the company was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients, and that TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" Ricks said.",

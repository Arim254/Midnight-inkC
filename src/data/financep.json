    "body": "For years, bedtime was the most stressful part of my day. No matter how early we started or how carefully I planned, evenings always felt chaotic.I've heard the same story from many of the parents I've worked with, and it's understandable. Bedtime is a major emotional transition that most of us were never taught how to navigate.But as a conscious-parenting researcher who has studied over 200 kids, I've noticed a clear pattern: The happiest, most emotionally well-rounded children have parents who follow a predictable routine that lowers anxiety and strengthens connection. Here's what they do differently.1. They let go of controlMany parents head into bedtime expecting resistance, and children can sense that tension almost immediately.Parents who experience smoother evenings aren't attached to how long the routine takes or how perfectly it unfolds. When you soften your grip on the outcome, your child's nervous system will follow.Remember, if bedtime takes 90 minutes instead of 30, but your child falls asleep feeling safe and calm, that's still a win.2. They connect before they disconnectStalling, clinging, tantrums and irritability at bedtime can be signs of separation anxiety. Parents who understand this slow down the final moments of the evening. They offer physical closeness or quiet presence before saying goodnight. Even 10 to 20 minutes of intentional connection can make a difference. From there, you can set clear but warm boundaries: \"I'm here with you now. After two books and a cuddle, it's time to turn the lights out.\"3. They remove pressure around sleepMany bedtime battles are simply about pressure. When children feel they're expected to \"fall asleep\" on command, their nervous systems shift into alert mode, making rest harder. Parents with the easiest nights stop making sleep the goal. They focus on creating calm conditions. This makes it more likely for our bodies to settle naturally.4. They build a bridge from night into morningTo a child, bedtime can feel like an abrupt ending. You can ease this transition by emphasizing what comes next: \"We'll finish this in the morning,\" or, \"We'll snuggle again when the sun comes up.\"This helps children experience bedtime as a pause, not a loss, reducing anxiety and resistance.Some parents also create this bridge by ending the night with a simple point of connection. They might ask, for example, \"What are you most excited for tomorrow?\" 5. They end the night by reinforcing safetySafety is the signal that tells a child's nervous system it can finally stop bracing and start resting. Without it, even the tiredest body stays alert.You can reinforce safety by saying things like: \"Today was hard. Tonight was hard. And I'm still here.\"\"You didn't have to be perfect today. You just had to be you.\"\"I'm here. You can rest.\" 6. They regulate their own emotionsFinally, and this might be the most important one: Emotionally attuned parents regulate themselves. Evenings are when you are most depleted and therefore most likely to react from stress rather than intention.So pause before engaging. Take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself whether you're carrying stress from the day into the moment. Settle yourself first, then support your child.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications and meetings involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. The latest documents reviewed by CNBC contained no indications of criminal wrongdoing or involvement in Epstein's illicit activities.However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "The Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center a day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) executed a search warrant in relation to the 2020 election in Union City, Georgia, U.S. January 29, 2026. Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA federal judge in Georgia ordered documents related to a Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on an election facility in Fulton County to be unsealed by Tuesday. The FBI raid that took place late last month was executed under a judicial warrant and resulted in troves of ballots from the 2020 election being taken into federal custody. Information related to the warrant including the affidavit must be unsealed by Tuesday, which could provide new details into the government's interest in obtaining the ballots.Fulton County Board of Commissioners Chair Robb Pitts and the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections are suing the federal government over the seizure of the ballots, seeking their return. \"Although Petitioners originally filed this case under seal, both parties have now indicated to the Court that they do not oppose unsealing the docket or the motions filed by Petitioners,\" wrote Judge J.P.

Trump and his allies vehemently denied that he lost the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, an assertion that has proven to be false. Fulton County was central to now-debunked claims of election fraud, with the president and his surrogates continuing to make allegations of fraud to this day despite a hand recount affirming Biden's victory in the state. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's appearance at the Georgia raid has only added to speculation, with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee denouncing the appearance. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner and other Democrats have warned that Trump may attempt to meddle in the 2026 midterm elections.\"When you put all of this together, it is clear that what happened in Fulton County is not about revisiting the past, it is about shaping the outcome of future elections,\" Warner said last week. Gabbard has defended her appearance at the election center, writing in a letter to Warner that it was \"requested\" by Trump and that she only observed the operation \"for a brief period of time.\" Trump later said at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday that it was actually Attorney General Pam Bondi who insisted Gabbard oversee the raid.Trump recently has been calling for a federal takeover of elections. States and local government typically run elections without interference from the federal government.",

    "body": "A robotic machine manufactures a semiconductor chip at a stall to show investors during The Advantage Assam 2.0 Investment Summit in Guwahati, India, on Feb. 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese interconnect chip designer Montage Technology surged more than 60% in its Hong Kong trading debut on Monday following an initial share sale that raised $902 million.The stock closed at 175 Hong Kong dollars ($22.39) after pricing its offering at HK$106.89, the upper end of the range.Founded in 2004, the Shanghai-based company specializes in supporting infrastructure chips for high-performance computing, data centers and artificial intelligence applications.Its Hong Kong public tranche was subscribed more than 700 times, while the international offering was nearly 38 times covered, signaling strong investor appetite for Chinese AI and semiconductor names.Montage Technology is also listed on the mainland, with a market capitalization of around $27 billion, according to LSEG data.The listing adds to a growing list of Chinese semiconductor firms tapping capital markets in recent months, with GigaDevice Semiconductor and OmniVision Integrated Circuits debuting in January. Other chip firms such as Biren Technology, MetaX, Moore Threads and Shanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor have also recently listed. The wave of IPOs comes as Beijing ramps up its self-sufficiency efforts in the advanced chip space and reduces reliance on American designers like Nvidia, which are prevented from selling its most advanced chips to China.  However, competition in the market is growing fierce, with Chinese tech giant Huawei and its chip unit HiSilicon holding a leading share of the domestic AI chip market. Meanwhile, Nvidia could be set for a market bounce back after the Trump administration cleared the way for it to sell its H200 chip to China. While the H200 lags Nvidia's most cutting-edge technologies, it is far more powerful than any AI chip previously sold in the Chinese market.China, in late January, had approved a first batch of H200 imports for several domestic tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent and DeepSeek, according to a report from Reuters. However, the report added that Beijing was only granting approvals under specific conditions, with the final rules still being finalized, according to anonymous sources. ",

    "description": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her firs",
    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

    "body": "watch nowThe NFL plans to hold talks with non-traditional media companies to potentially sell them the rights to a live game, NFL Media chief Hans Schroeder told CNBC Sport on Friday.\"We have other people that are both partners in a smaller sense — maybe not a full package — or people that still are in the media landscape somewhere that would like to be an NFL live game partner,\" Schroeder said in an interview from Radio Row ahead of Super Bowl LX in San Francisco. \"We're going to have those conversations,\" he added. \"We want to understand all our options and how to think about the best model for us, for our fans, for our teams going forward. So to your question, you know, we're going to listen and probably have a lot of different people that want to have a conversation with us. That's very fortunate. We say that humbly, and we're going to make sure we have those conversations to understand.\"Schroeder didn't offer details on which companies could be interested in buying a live game. The NFL sold a week one game to YouTube last season for about $100 million -- a one-off strategy that it could replicate with other digital platforms. The societal-wide shift to streaming has made digital a comparable rival to broadcast TV, which has long been the league's preferred distribution strategy due to its reach.\"Now you see these big digital platforms that can reach broadcast level audiences,\" Schroeder said. \"That just creates more optionality.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The NFL and its traditional media partners — Disney, Paramount Global, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon — will likely begin discussing a new media rights later this year, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause, according to people familiar with the matter. Schroeder echoed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's comments to CNBC in September that the league would be open to having those talks.\"I'm sure they're doing work on their end when the time's right, because they either want to sort of press the 'engage' button or the commissioner says, 'Hey, let's go do this,'\" Schroeder said.The NFL is expanding the number of international games to nine next season — a record high. The league may sell a new package of some of those games to a media partner as soon as next year, he said.\"That'll be one of the things we look at,\" Schroeder said.",

    "body": "A young woman wearing headphones browses vintage vinyl records in a store.Mihailomilovanovic | E+ | Getty ImagesAccount manager Matt Richards, 23, deleted all his social media apps from his phone last year, and was surprised to find that his life changed for the better. Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison.\"I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world,\" Richards told CNBC Make It. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. Going chronically offline is the latest trend to grip young people, and ironically it's going viral on social media. There's been a surge of TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engage more with in-person and analog hobbies. When I discovered the trend, I decided to post on LinkedIn to see if there were any young people willing to speak to me about going offline. To my surprise, I received nearly 100 responses from Gen Z and millennials sharing stories about social media detoxes and digital burnout. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. A 2025 Deloitte consumer trends survey of more than 4,000 Brits found that nearly a quarter of all consumers had deleted a social media app in the previous 12 months, rising to nearly a third for Gen Zers. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined since time spent on the platforms peaked in 2022, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, the report found. The decline was particularly pronounced among teens and 20-somethings. Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said the increased \"nastiness and divisiveness\" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. \"We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life,\" Dorsey said. 'Pressure platform' Young people who are deleting their social media platforms cite the increasing pressures of being online as well as damage to their mental health as causes.Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social apps reported these apps had negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. \"I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere,\" Richards said, adding that it influenced his own feelings of not having enough stuff or accomplishing enough in his career. We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them...this person doesn't need validation.Matt Richards 23-year-old account manager Similarly, 36-year-old entrepreneur Lucy Stace said she's limiting her social media use because it's \"diminishing\" her mental health despite it being essential to her business. \"We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information,\" she said. \"We're actually diminishing our brain's capacity to be able to look inward and listen to ourselves, and we're value tagging all of these things that aren't actually important to us.\" Tech giants face \"tremendous pressure\" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, said Dorsey, which can be off-putting to younger generations. \"The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to — they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world — now they're getting advertised to even more, and their feeds feel just [like] commercial after commercial,\" Dorsey said. Offline is the new 'cool' As the tide shifts against social media, account manager Richards noted that those who have gone offline have become more interesting. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. \"We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s,\" he said. Social media manager Julianna Salguero, 31, said that social media stopped being cool when politicians and brands started using the platform.\"The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it,\" Salguero said. As the digital generation struggles to make friends and find partners, they're instead seeking out in-person events like speed dating and professional networking, citing high levels of loneliness and isolation as a key driver. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an \"extremely exhausting process\" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. \"There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings,\" Gerrard said. \"It's so much more than a trend.\" GWI analyst Chris Beer said he believes this is a \"legitimate post-pandemic correction,\" since people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. This shift is \"largely due to structural time allocation,\" he said, especially for younger users, rather than \"an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media.\" Social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education, Beer said.Analog is back In a Substack post in September that got 5,000 likes, Salguero expressed a yearning to have lived life in the '90s when dating apps and doom scrolling weren't a prerequisite of young adulthood. Her article, titled \"How to have an analog fall,\" wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media — from going on lunch dates to writing physical letters and opting for tangible media like newspapers. Salguero said going analog is a \"quiet revolution\" against social media, streaming, and content overload. Lacy Stace and her boyfriend's record collection.\"When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them,\" she said. \"So for me, the going analog of it all isn't necessarily throwing my phone into the ocean, it's more about, 'How do I reset my relationship with it?'\"Indeed, young people are increasingly turning towards physical media as they seek a break from digital life. Some are purchasing vinyl and record players, while others are getting flip phones, a relic of the 2000s. Stace and her boyfriend have started building a record collection and visit record stores when they can, she said.Richards, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a \"brick phone\" too, reverting back to the time when phones were primarily used to call people.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate credit markets are facing fresh uncertainty as AI-driven tools start to pressure software companies, a major borrower group for private lenders.The software industry came under renewed pressure last week after artificial intelligence firm Anthropic unveiled new AI tools, sparking a sell-off in software data provider shares. The AI tools, developed by Anthropic, are designed to perform complex professional tasks that many software companies currently charge for, raising fresh concerns that AI could weaken traditional software business models.Shares of asset managers with large private credit franchises tumbled this week as investors fretted about how AI could upend borrowers' business models, pressure cash flows and ultimately lift default risks.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPrivate credit stocks in the past monthAres Management fell over 12% last week, while Blue Owl Capital lost over 8%. KKR declined almost 10%. TPG lost about 7%. Apollo Global and BlackRock fell over 1% and 5%, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 declined by about 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.8%.The moves bring to fore a growing unease around private credit market which now has to brace for the impact from AI-driven disruption to the software sector that is heavily exposed to buyouts financed with opaque, illiquid loans, according to market watchers.Private credit loans to a lot of software companies. If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.Jeffrey HookeJohns Hopkins Carey Business School\"Enterprise software companies have been a favored sector for private credit lenders since 2020,\" PitchBook wrote in a report last week following the fallout, adding that many of the largest-ever unitranche (two or more loans combined into one) loans, the favorite structure of the private credit market, have been to software and tech companies.Software makes up a significant share of loans held by U.S. business development companies, accounting for about 17% of BDC investments by deal count, second only to commercial services, data from PitchBook showed.That exposure could prove costly if AI adoption accelerates faster than borrowers can adapt. UBS Group has warned that, in an aggressive disruption scenario, default rates in U.S. private credit could climb to 13%, significantly higher than the stress projected for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, which UBS estimates could come to around 8% and 4%, respectively.\"Private credit loans to a lot of software companies,\" said Jeffrey C. Hooke, a senior lecturer in finance at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. \"If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.\"Hooke, however, said that strains in private credit pre-date the latest AI concerns, pointing to issues around liquidity and loan extensions. \"A lot of private credit funds have had problems liquidating their loans,\" he said, adding that the recent developments has simply added another layer to a sector already under pressure. watch nowThis slate of new warnings come on the back of recent concerns in the $3 trillion industry over leverage, opaque valuations and the risk that isolated problems may turn out to be systemic issuesJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warned late last year about private credit's 'cockroaches,' cautioning that stress in one borrower can signal more hidden trouble.\"AI disruption could be a credit risk for private credit lenders for some of its Software & Services sector borrowers and perhaps not for others as it depends on which ones are behind the AI curve and which ones are on top of it,\" said Kenny Tang, head of U.S. credit research at PitchBook LCD.Tang added that software and services companies account for the largest share of payment-in-kind (PIK) loans, which refer to arrangements where borrowers can delay paying interest in cash. While PIK structures are often used to give fast-growing companies time to build revenue and cash flow, they become risky if a borrower's finances weaken. In that case, deferred interest can quickly turn into a credit problem, he said. Moody Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi noted that while it is difficult to grasp a complete assessment of risks in the sector given its opacity, the rapid growth in AI-related borrowing, mounting leverage and a lack of transparency are considerable \"yellow flags.\"\"There will surely be significant credit problems, and while the private credit industry is probably currently able to absorb any losses reasonably well, this may not be the case a year from now if the current credit growth continues.\"Apollo, Blue Owl, TPG and BlakRock did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries, while KKR declined to comment.Ares Management CEO Michael Arougheti said the firm’s exposure to software was limited, with software loans making up about 6% of its total assets and less than 9% of private credit AUM.He added that Ares mainly lends to profitable software firms with strong cash flow and keeps borrowing levels low, which has helped keep problem loans close to zero.",

Japanese stocks surged to fresh record highs, while bonds dropped, after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party secured a landslide victory. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA yen nearing 160 to the dollar, record Japanese equities and higher Japanese government bond yields could be on the table after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi romped to a landslide victory in the country's snap election Sunday. Takaichi led the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a supermajority in the Lower House, securing 316 seats in the party's largest election victory since World War Two. The result gives her the power to override any legislative veto from the Upper House, strengthening her ability to push her agenda through Japan's legislature. 'Takaichi Trade' returnsAnalysts said that her victory will lead to a revival of the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" which typically involves a weaker yen, rising equities, and higher long-dated Japanese government bond yields. The trend reflects Takaichi's dovish stance on monetary policy and expectations of expanded fiscal stimulus. Some early signs of these emerged Monday. The benchmark Nikkei 225 soared past the 57,000 mark to a record high, while the broader Topix rose to an all-time peak of 3,825.67, exceeding Citi analysts' pre-election expectations.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon\"The strong LDP win is warming the hearts of investors,\" said Frederic Neumann, Chief Asia Economist at HSBC. \"Equities, in particular, are celebrating the surprising election result, re-loading the 'Takaichi-trade.'\"\"The hope is that the strong majority will give the LDP more leeway in pursuing growth-friendly policies,\" Neumann added. This is echoed by Adrian Wong, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, who said the victory would lead to proactive fiscal measures, such as the two-year consumption tax cut, to increased corporate investment and aggressive corporate reforms.Debt concerns lingerHowever, while most analysts agree on the boost to equities, some warned that heavier spending could pressure bonds and raise bond yields. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose 4 basis points to 2.27% on Monday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBefore the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the financial year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending. Japan is the most indebted nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 230% in 2025, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Takaichi told national broadcaster NHK after the election that she was pursuing \"a shift in economic and fiscal policy and a 'responsible, proactive fiscal policy.'' \"We will move forward with areas where we can, and will call for cooperation from the opposition parties in areas where we can gain their support,\" she added, according to a Google translation. Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at Swiss private bank UBP, expects the 10-year yield to reach 2.5%, with most of the pressure concentrated at the ultra-long end of the yield curve.watch nowOthers were more cautious. Sree Kochugovindan of Aberdeen Investments said the LDP landslide does not entitle Takaichi \"free rein to just spend.\"\"The LDP is fiscally conservative, and Takaichi has been very mindful of bond investors,\" the senior research economist noted.Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio has declined since the pandemic, he said, and Takaichi's latest fiscal and economic package will keep it on that downward trend.Takaichi said the amount of newly issued government bonds is expected to be 29.6 trillion yen, marking the second consecutive year that issuance remains below 30 trillion yen.Yen headed the opposite wayHowever, in an uncharacteristic move, the yen strengthened 0.4% to trade at 156.55 against the dollar after Takaichi's electoral victory.Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, wrote in a note Monday that the move likely reflected continued commitment by Takaichi on fiscal sustainability in her post-election comments, as well as comments from Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama supporting yen stability, in coordination with U.S. authorities.Katayama reportedly said that she would communicate with financial markets on Monday if needed, following Takaichi's win. The yen had approached the 160 mark against the dollar earlier this year, before strengthening sharply in late January amid speculation that the New York Federal Reserve conducted \"rate checks\" on the yen, often seen as a signal of possible intervention. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later denied that the U.S. had intervened.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKatayama early Monday did not rule out taking action against \"rapid movements out of line with fundamentals,\" saying that measures included intervention in the currency market.For analysts, 160 yen to the greenback seems to be the line in the sand, with Citi analysts saying the yen is unlikely to weaken far beyond that level, given awareness of potential forex intervention by Japanese or U.S. authorities.\"The yen will approach the 160 level once more,  but there will likely be a struggle between the market and the authorities near the 159 mark,\" Dutch bank ING said in a Feb. 9 note.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's journey to becoming the world's first trillionaire will likely be powered by rockets rather than cars, as SpaceX now accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Tesla CEO's wealth.Musk became the first person ever to top the $800 billion mark this week, with his net worth now around $845 billion, according to Forbes. He's worth more than the next three richest people – Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – combined.The tech magnate's unprecedented wealth surged after his aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, acquired his artificial intelligence and social media company, xAI, this week in a deal that valued the merged entity at $1.25 trillion, according to financial documents reviewed by CNBC. With Musk's ownership estimated at around 43% in the combined company, his stake would be valued at over $530 billion, marking a rapid shift in his fortunes. Musk's priorities are also likely shifting his focus more to SpaceX than Tesla, a reality that the EV company acknowledged in its latest proxy filing, where it noted that \"a majority of Mr. Musk's wealth is now derived from other business ventures.\"Last year, Musk confirmed he wants to take SpaceX public in 2026, which would make Tesla a less prevalent component of his liquid wealth. But he still has to get buy-in from public market investors, who may be reluctant to pay up for a company that combines a defense contractor and satellite business with a cash-burning AI model developer that's trying to take on Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. SpaceX has received more than $20 billion from contracts with the federal government, according to research from FedScout, with more lucrative contracts on the way, and Musk has framed the acquisition as the next step towards \"orbital data centers.\"\"You've muddied up your story a little bit as a pure-play SpaceX shareholder, but the opportunity has gotten a lot bigger,\" said Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, which works on transactions for pre-IPO companies. \"It makes sense for them to access a much larger capital market, especially with xAI, which does have insatiable need for capital.\" XAI is currently being investigated by authorities in Europe, Asia, Australia and California, after the company's Grok image generator let users create and share \"deepfake\" explicit images of children and women.It's not clear whether Musk's merger will require any regulatory review. Democratic senators this week called for the Pentagon to investigate SpaceX over undisclosed Chinese investors in the company.watch nowMusk still has a major incentive to stay focused on Tesla. Late last year, shareholders voted to approve a new pay package that could be worth $1 trillion, paid out in 12 tranches, if Tesla hits certain milestones, including market cap gains and operational achievements, over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market cap of $2 trillion, about $460 billion more than the current valuation.Tesla said in the proxy filing detailing the plan that the structure aims to \"prevent him from prioritizing those other ventures.\"However, Columbia Law professor Dorothy Lund, a corporate and securities law expert, told CNBC in an email that the strategy may not work. Musk is now \"negotiating comp packages at each company, with each board trying to induce him to pay attention via comp,\" Lund wrote. \"If SpaceX/xAI gives him more money and a bigger share, that Tesla package may look less appealing.\" Before the xAI acquisition, Musk owned about 42% of SpaceX and controlled 80% of the votes, according to FCC reports. His current ownership in Tesla is between 11% and 15% of shares outstanding, depending on what's included in his stake, according to public filings.With Tesla's brand value and core auto sales in decline, and its long-promised robotaxis and humanoid robots still in development, the company's stock price is down about 9% this year.Based on Musk's ownership in SpaceX, and assuming Tesla shares are flat, the rocket and AI company would have to reach a valuation of about $1.6 trillion for the world's richest person to reach trillionaire status.Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, is betting that Musk won't ever want to take SpaceX public as a standalone entity. Rather, he expects to see a merger of SpaceX and Tesla, and he speculated this week it would list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol X, which formerly belonged to U.S. Steel. Gerber is a long-time Tesla investor and now holds shares in SpaceX after his firm previously backed Musk's leveraged buyout of Twitter in 2022. Musk rebranded Twitter as X, and merged the social network with xAI last year. Consolidating his empire makes sense, Gerber said, because it would allow Musk to fulfill his dream of running one big company under the brand name X. Following Alphabet's announcement this week that it will spend up to $185 billion on capex this year, Gerber said Musk is going to have to be able to bring in massive sums of cash. \"This huge entity would make it easier for them to raise money and borrow,\" he said. \"How else is Musk supposed to compete and become a major AI player?\"Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "Bird's-eye view of central Tokyo including Tokyo Tower at sunrise hours.Vladimir Zakharov | Moment | Getty ImagesJapanese stocks jumped to a record high Monday, leading gains in the region after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi won a landmark election victory.The ruling Liberal Democratic Party captured a two-thirds supermajority in the 465-seat lower house, public broadcaster NHK reported.Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped past 57,000 for the first time before paring gains to close 3.9% higher at 56,363.94, while the Topix also notched a record high, closing at 3,783.94, up 2.3%.A decisive win for Takaichi could be the \"best outcome\" for markets over the medium term, as strategic investments and tax reform bolster equities, said Sree Kochugovindan, senior research economist at Aberdeen Investments.Japanese stocks have hit several highs over the past few months, driven by the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" as markets expect the prime minister's economic policies — seen as growth‑focused continuation of Abenomics — to boost equities, while weakening the yen as she pushes for a looser monetary policy and higher government spending.  Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapanese shares' performance in the past yearThe Japanese yen strengthened to 156.88 against the dollar. Yields on the 10-year Japanese government bonds rose nearly 4 basis points to 2.274%, while yields on 20-year JGBs added about 3 basis points to 3.158%.Takaichi's administration has gained stronger momentum to pursue a major shift toward proactive fiscal policy, backed by a clear public mandate, Crédit Agricole CIB echoed in a note following her victory.U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated Takaichi on her victory in a TruthSocial post.\"She is a highly respected and very popular Leader. Sanae's bold and wise decision to call for an Election paid off big time,\" he wrote. \"The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.\"The election follows political upheaval last year, when the LDP lost its majority in the Upper House, and a Lower House defeat in 2024, which prompted then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to resign in September.Other Asian markets also traded higher, with South Korea's Kospi jumping 4.1% to 5,298.04, while the small-cap Kosdaq added 4.3% to 1,127.55. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.85%, closing at 8,870.1.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1.71% as of its last hour, while the mainland's CSI 300 climbed 1.63% to 4,719.06.India's Nifty 50 had added 0.61% as of 1:30 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET). Thailand's SET Index jumped almost 4% after Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul's Bhumjaithai Party secured a decisive win in Sunday's general election.U.S. futures inched higher.Last Friday in the U.S., stocks surged as tech names recovered following several days of heavy selling in the sector and bitcoin rebounded following a rout that took the popular cryptocurrency down more than 50% from its high in October last year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1,206.95 points, or 2.47%, closing at 50,115.67.

    "body": "A snow removal machine is seen working while a Boeing 737 American Airlines passenger aircraft is parked at gate on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights.

Whether it's wearing a quarter-zip sweater or the latest \"401(k) mullet\" hairstyle, young men, especially, are leaning into styles that give an air of monetary responsibility.\"Men not only found a voice but are finding their place through these trends,\" said Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the fashion and luxury program at New York University's Stern School of Business.Clothing, hairstyles, music and even underwear have often been seen as leading economic indicators. For example, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan believed that men's buying habits regarding underwear were a good indication of whether consumers were making fewer discretionary purchases.Here's what experts say these new trends show about how consumers feel toward the U.S. economy and the job market.The '401(k) mullet'The old 401(k) is now cool. These employer-sponsored retirement savings plans have been steadily gaining steam for years, but in 2026, they've tapped into the zeitgeist. A new NerdWallet survey found that 15% of adults wouldn't date someone who didn't have a retirement account. According to Vogue, the \"401(k) mullet\" is catching on, which is a more grown-up version of its shaggy predecessor.Jacob Elordi attends the premiere of \"Wuthering Heights\" at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California, Jan. 28, 2026Unique Nicole | Filmmagic | Getty ImagesUnlike previous iterations, \"the 401(k) haircut is very contained,\" Serdari said. \"We are finally moving away from the time of the tech entrepreneur who drops out of college and yet will make tons of money,\" she said. \"People are slowly returning to a more put-together version of themselves with the intention of finding a job.\" Men want to \"emulate the lifestyle they want to achieve and, in that way, attract success,\" Serdari said.Social media seems to agree: When rapper T-Pain posted a photo of himself on Instagram in mid-November with the caption \"401k and a quarter zip,\" he garnered more than 122,000 likes. The 'quarter-zip movement'Since recent grad Jason Gyamfi started the \"quarter-zip movement\" in a Nov. 5 TikTok video, the sweater itself has become a symbol of how to look like an up-and-coming professional.\"What began as a simple style shift became a message — one that's inspiring people to grow, reinvent themselves, and carry confidence in everything they do,\" Gyamfi wrote in a Dec. 10 LinkedIn post about his viral video, which has been viewed more than 31 million times. Filadendron | Istock | Getty ImagesWith fewer job prospects, in part due to the rise of artificial intelligence, \"a lot of young people feel the odds are against them,\" Serdari said. \"They don't have a way of reaching the security their parents and grandparents had,\" she said.  Amid today's softening labor market, the traditional \"path to a stable job with a 401(k) and prospects of success and financial growth … is not guaranteed,\" she said.\"What used to be boring — the 401(k) — is unattainable and therefore sexy,\" Serdari said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'big beautiful bill' may spur the rise of 'un-college,' experts sayFirst the quarter zip, now a '401(k) mullet' — what trends say about the economyHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

In the years that followed, the so-called K-shaped economy left the wealthiest Americans even better off than before, largely after benefiting from stock market gains and appreciating home values.Even when most Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, the trend toward luxury took hold in a big way once consumers caught Gwyneth Paltrow's courtroom aesthetic at her ski accident trial in 2023.Actress Gwyneth Paltrow enters the courtroom for her trial in Park City, Utah, March 24, 2023.Rick Bowmer | Getty ImagesA year later, TikToker Megan Boni posted a video that quickly went viral when she sang about trying to find a \"man in finance\" with a \"trust fund.\" That video was viewed more than 60 million times.Since then, the consumer economy has only become more bifurcated. Wealth continues to rise faster for those at the very top, data from the Federal Reserve shows, as the value of their investment holdings grows. The top 10% of Americans hold over 87% of corporate equities and mutual fund shares.\"People are searching to find a recipe for belonging, for making it in a world that has been exclusionary with a growing disparity between rich and poor,\" Serdari said.401(k) balances are growingMany of these workers are now exhibiting \"positive savings behaviors,\" according to Kirsten Hunter Peterson, vice president of workplace thought leadership at Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) savings plans.watch nowOverall, retirement account balances, which sank at the start of 2025 amid wild market swings, are at all-time highs, according to the latest data from Fidelity.  Near the end of last year, the average 401(k) balance hit a record $144,400, Fidelity found.\"When it comes to younger workers, many of them do get a bad rap [on saving for retirement], but the numbers tell a different story,\" Hunter Peterson said.While other research points to retirement saving shortfalls across generations, \"Gen Z is saving earlier and at higher rates than previous generations before them,\" she said.In part, Generation Z is more prone to sharing financial information and tips on social media and, in some cases, that is an extremely effective way to convey the benefits of saving for retirement, Hunter Peterson said. Still, there is no substitute for personalized recommendations from a vetted financial advisor, she added. \"When it comes to taking action, especially for younger investors, it's important to listen to a trusted source,\" she said. \"There are a lot of 'finfluencers' out there who are not licensed professionals.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "<div><div><p>Alistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Online holiday spending in the U.S. is expected to jump 5.3% year over year to $253.4 billion as consumers seek discounts and even enlist the help of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots, according to an Adobe Analytics report released Monday.</p><p>Yet that growth would still be slower than the year-ago holiday season, when online sales rose 8.7% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, the company said. Adobe's data tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, 100 million unique items and 18 different product categories.</p><p>That growth is also below the 10-year average of roughly 13% annually. That mark was partially skewed by the 32% year-over-year growth in 2020 when consumers leaned on retailers' online options during the Covid pandemic.</p></div><div><p>Customers' desire to celebrate the season with decor and gifts — and to take advantage of lower prices during a promotional time — will prop up spending even at an uncertain time for the U.S. economy, said Vivek Pandya, Adobe's director of digital insights.</p><p>\"The holiday season is one of the areas where they do feel much more of an onus and a drive to get the goods they need,\" he said. \"We're seeing them willing to spend and capitalize on these sales moments.\"</p><p>Plus, he said consumers have embraced the habit of stockpiling goods if they feel prices may be volatile, which could help to stabilize spending.</p><p>He said while holiday spending is expected to slow from last year, \"given everything that the consumer is dealing with, it's still pronounced growth.\"</p><p>Higher online spending may not necessarily translate to a boost in overall holiday sales. Adobe's data tracks only e-commerce, and the company estimates about 1 in 4 dollars of holiday sales will be spent online, Pandya said.</p><p>Retail sales in the U.S. have chugged along this year, but concerns about <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/consumer-prices-rose-at-annual-rate-of-2point9percent-in-august-as-weekly-jobless-claims-jump.html\">higher prices from tariffs</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/consumer-confidence-is-lower-than-expected-as-wall-street-braces-for-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">dipping consumer confidence</a> have complicated the outlook for the critical shopping season. Some holiday forecasts, which capture both in-store and online spending, have predicted more modest growth than in recent years or even a decline.</p><p>Holiday spending across stores and online is expected to grow 4% year over year – a decline from the 10-year average of 5.2% growth, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.'s projections.</p><p>Consumers said they <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/holiday-shopping-gen-z-retailers.html\">plan to spend about 5% less</a> – or an average of $1,552 – on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment, compared with the year-ago season, according to a survey by consulting firm PwC, which included a representative sample of 4,000 U.S. consumers and was conducted in late June and early July. That projected spending, in particular, was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/holiday-shopping-gen-z-retailers.html\">dragged down by members of Gen Z</a> saying that they planned to spend 23% less than the year-ago holiday season, according to PwC's survey.</p><p>Adobe expects the peak of holiday<strong> </strong>spending during Cyber Week, which stretches from Thanksgiving through the Monday after Thanksgiving that's dubbed Cyber Monday. That five-day period is expected to drive 17.2%, or $43.7 billion, of overall online holiday spending, Adobe said, roughly in line with the 17% that period accounted for in the year-ago holiday season.</p><p>Discounting levels will be roughly similar to the year-ago holiday season, Adobe predicted, with slightly weaker discounts in some categories. For example, discounts on electronics are expected to peak at 28% off the listed price compared with 30.1% in the year-ago period. Adobe expects toys to hit 27% off compared with 28% in the year-ago period.</p><p>Mobile devices will be the primary driver for online shopping, Adobe said, with the company expecting holiday shopping done there to account for 56.1% of online spending compared with desktops. It's a meaningful jump from the 40% of online spending that mobile devices represented during the 2020 holiday season.</p><p>As shoppers search for gifts, more are expected to turn to generative AI-powered chat services and browsers to research what toys, jewelry, clothing or other items to buy. Adobe expects AI traffic to rise by 520% year over year, with the busiest traffic days leading up to Thanksgiving.</p><p><em>Correction: Adobe expects the peak of holiday<strong> </strong>spending during Cyber Week, which stretches from Thanksgiving through the Monday after Thanksgiving that's dubbed Cyber Monday. An earlier version misstated a day.</em></p></div></div>",

After rallying 40% in the third quarter, the stock is now up 12% for the year. </p></div></div>",

French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned Monday morning, just a day after President Emmanuel Macron named a new cabinet that was broadly criticized. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p><p>Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>As news of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's resignation broke on Monday morning, journalists scrambled to get in touch with government spokespeople to clarify which ministers were actually in charge: the ones Lecornu had nominated only the night before, or the ones that were previously in office before the reshuffle?</p><p>That's how unprecedented and unique the French political situation is right now (and by the way the answer is: the ones nominated Sunday night will be caretaking until a new PM and government are picked).</p><p>Thirteen hours after announcing his new government's cabinet, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/frances-new-pm-resigns-as-political-chaos-continues.html\">just 27 days in the job, Lecornu handed over his resignation</a> to French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>The political fragmentation after the July 2024 snap election caused this instability, with opposing political blocs emerging in the two rounds of voting that fell far from an absolute majority.</p></div><div><p>Outgoing French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu, who submitted his government's resignation to the French President this morning, reacts after delivering a statement at the Hotel Matignon in Paris, on October 6, 2025. </p><p>Stephane Mahe | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>That led Macron to install minority governments that relied upon, and ultimately failed, due to precarious pacts and dealmaking.</p><p>On the one hand, there is an air of déjà vu in France now: the next PM will be Macron's sixth in less than two years.</p><p>On the other hand, the current crisis is different: the Lecornu government was not toppled by the opposition, like those of predecessors Michel Barnier or Francois Bayrou — it was its own allies that caused its downfall.</p></div><h2><a></a>An ally turns</h2><div><p>In his address Monday morning to explain his decision to resign, Lecornu blamed political parties' intransigence for the impasse France finds itself in.</p><p>\"I was ready to compromise, but each political party wanted the other political party to adopt its entire program,\" he said, adding that \"the composition of the government woke up some partisan appetites that are not unrelated to the future presidential election.\"</p><p>This was a barely hidden criticism of Bruno Retailleau, the freshly reappointed interior minister and leader of the center-right group, Les Republicains (LR). </p><p>Shortly after the nominations Sunday night, Retailleau criticized the composition of a government \"that does not reflect the promised break\" by Lecornu, and said his party's executive would meet the next day to decide whether it would continued to support the government.</p><p>The LR and its 49 lawmakers had been part of the \"socle commun\" (common base) working with Macron's centrist alliance, Ensemble, since the snap election, and even before that on some key reforms.  Many held key roles, including Bruno Le Maire, the former economy and finance minister whose return to government as new defense minister ruffled feathers within the LR party. </p></div><div><p>France's Minister of the Interior Bruno Retailleau at the National Assembly in Paris, France, on September 8, 2025.</p><p>Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>It's quite ironic that a party that likes to present itself as the party of responsibility, particularly when it comes to public finances, triggered the latest French political crisis. But LR's distancing from the government left Lecornu with no room for maneuver. </p><p>In a way, the breakup of the \"socle commun\" is not surprising. As we get closer to the 2027 presidential election, parties and key political figures think about their future. Macron cannot run again after winning the presidency twice. With his unpopularity, even allies are starting to distance themselves. The latest move by LR could be another step in a wider political re-alignment ahead of the election.</p></div><h2><a></a>What now?</h2><div><p>So now all eyes turn to the Elysee, again.</p><p>In a surprise twist on Monday evening, Macron gave Lecornu another 48 hours for \"final discussions\" with rival parties to try to break the impasse.</p><div><p>Lecornu wrote on <a href=\"https://x.com/SebLecornu/status/1975232236967600416\" target=\"_blank\">social media platform X</a> that he will report to the president on Wednesday evening on any potential breakthrough \"so that he can draw all the necessary conclusions.\"</p><p>It's hard to see what Lecornu can achieve in 48 hours, beyond what he's done since his nomination almost a month ago.</p></div><p>So will the next step be another snap election?</p><p>The far-right led by Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen are calling for this. That's not surprising, since polls show them in the lead with 30 to 35% of the vote.</p></div><div><p>President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen (L) speaks to French far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) RN party's President and lead MEP Jordan Bardella during the French far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) RN party's parliamentary seminar at the French National Assembly in Paris on September 14, 2024. </p><p>Ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><div><p>That was also the case last year but eventually a coalition of the left, and a so-called \"cordon sanitaire\" vote, came top. That coalition between the far-left, communists, greens and socialists has since imploded.</p><p>A dissolution of the National Assembly would indeed be the logical democratic choice in the current situation, but there is no guarantee that it would deliver any clearer majority.</p></div><div><p>Lecornu concluded his resignation statement Monday morning saying, \"one must always prefer one's country to one's party.\"</p><p>Last year's snap election result was a test: would French lawmakers learn to work in broad coalitions like so many of their European counterparts?

Lecornu wrote on X that he will report to the president on Wednesday evening on any potential breakthrough \"so that he can draw all the necessary conclusions.\"</p><p>Markets were rattled by Lecornu's resignation; France's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.FCHI/\">CAC 40</a> index closed lower by around 1.3% on Monday, having pared some earlier losses.

The new forecast is closer to China's official target of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/05/china-reportedly-targets-around-5percent-growth-in-2025-amid-trade-war-worries.html\">around 5% growth in</a> gross domestic product in 2025.</p><p>The economists did not provide a specific reason for the change in forecast from April, but noted that China's economy has benefited from government support that could fade next year.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. escalated in April, temporarily sending U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to well over 100% before the two countries reached a trade truce — now in effect until mid-November. For now, U.S. tariffs on <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart\" target=\"_blank\">China are 57.6%</a>, more than double where they were at the start of the year.</p><p>China ramped up stimulus in late 2024 and has maintained targeted consumer trade-in programs this year to support retail sales. The country's exports, a major <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/07/china-july-trade-data-exports-growth-beats-estimates-as-imports-recover.html\">driver of its growth</a>, have continued to rise so far this year, as shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe have offset a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/china-exports-growth-in-august-drops-missing-expectations-.html\">sharp decline in exports to the U.S</a>. Businesses ramping up orders ahead of higher tariffs have also helped support China's exports.</p><p>Growth in exports helped China offset drags on domestic growth such as the ongoing real estate slump and tepid consumer spending. But that momentum is expected to slow.</p><p>The World Bank projects China's GDP growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026, partly due to slower exports growth. Economists also anticipate that Beijing will tone down stimulus to keep public debt levels from rising too quickly, while China's overall economic growth slows compared with its rapid expansion in past years.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208239-17597666301759766627-41974059223-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759766629&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Nike CEO Elliott Hill: We've diversified our manufacturing portfolio away from China\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>China's retail sales rose <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/china-retail-sales-industrial-output-slow-in-august-missing-estimates-as-real-estate-slump-worsens.html\">just 3.4%</a> in August from a year ago, missing analysts' expectations. Investment in real estate fell further, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/china-retail-sales-industrial-output-slow-in-august-missing-estimates-as-real-estate-slump-worsens.html\">down by 12.9%</a> for the first eight months of the year, versus a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/15/chinas-growth-stumbles-in-july-as-weak-demand-industrial-capacity-curbs-weigh.html\">12% drop for the first seven months.</a></p><p>Preliminary figures for the eight-day \"Golden Week\" holiday that wraps up Wednesday also pointed to sluggish consumer spending.</p><p>While average daily domestic passenger trips rose 5.4% year-on-year to 296 million for the Oct. 1 to 5 period, that growth was much slower than the 7.9% seen during the May 1 to 5 public holiday, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report Monday, citing official data.</p><p>\"Actual consumption growth could be even weaker than the data suggest,\" Lu said, noting that due to the agrarian calendar, this year's Golden Week combined what have typically been two public holidays.</p><p>Oct. 1 is China's National Day, while a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival fell on Oct. 6 this year, versus Sept. 17 last year. As a result, China's Golden Week ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year, versus Oct. 1 to 7 last year.</p><p>The economists pointed out that one out of every seven young people in China is unemployed, while the country faces challenges from technological disruption and an aging population. The World Bank also noted that<strong> </strong>startups in China only increase employment fourfold, versus sevenfold in the U.S., highlighting that a differentiating factor was the presence of state-owned enterprises in China versus North America.</p><p>A decline in China's GDP by 1 percentage point lowers growth in the rest of developing East Asia and Pacific by 0.3 percentage points, according to World Bank estimates. With the China GDP upgrade, the region is expected to expand by 4.8% this year, versus 4% forecast earlier this year, according to the World Bank.</p><p>In June, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.3%, largely due to trade uncertainty, noting it would be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/world-bank-cuts-2025-growth-outlook-to-2point3percent-as-trade-tariffs-weigh.html\">slowest expansion since 2008</a>, excluding global recessions.</p></div></div>",

He showed how third-party applications could plug in with OpenAI's Apps SDK, or software development framework.</p><p>\"When someone's using ChatGPT, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name,\" Altman said. \"For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChatGPT and then say, Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram. The Figma app will take over respond and complete the action.\"</p><p>In addition to asking for Figma's help by name in ChatGPT, the assistant can also suggest Figma when it's relevant, Figma product manager Luke Zhang said in a <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/turn-your-chatgpt-brainstorms-into-figjam-diagrams/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p><p>The rally for Figma, at its high point, was the steepest since the day of the company's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/figma-fig-starts-trading-on-nyse-after-ipo.html\">public market debut</a> on the New York Stock Exchange in July.</p><p>Figma has been ramping up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/03/figma-ceo-dylan-fields-path-from-college-dropout-to-billionaire.html\">its own tools</a> for working on app and website designs using generative AI models <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/turn-your-chatgpt-brainstorms-into-figjam-diagrams/\" target=\"_blank\">from OpenAI</a> and other providers.</p><p>Subscribers to products that connect to the Apps SDK will be able to log in without leaving their ChatGPT conversations, Altman said. He said people working on products in Figma can also launch the FigJam tool to keep working on development ideas. Apps SDK is based on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that OpenAI rival Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">introduced</a> last year.</p><p>Software developers will be able to submit apps for review later in 2025, Altman said.</p><p>Over time, OpenAI will offer many ways to generate revenue through third-party integrations, Altman said.

If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999.\"</p><p>The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said today's market is reminiscent of the setup leading up to the burst of the dot-com bubble in late 1999, with dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones said the circular deals or vendor financing happening in the artificial intelligence space today also made him \"nervous.\"</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs.

The Federal Reserve had just begun a new easing cycle, whereas rate hikes were on the way before the market top in 2000. The U.S. is now running a 6% budget deficit, while in 1999, there was a budget surplus of $99,000, Jones said.</p><p>\"That fiscal monetary combination is a brew that we haven't seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early '50s,\" he said.</p><p>The longtime investor highlighted the tension at the heart of every late-stage bull market — the eagerness to capture outsized gains and the inevitability of a painful correction.</p><p>\"You have to get on and off the train pretty quick. If you just think about bull markets, the greatest price appreciations always [occurs] the 12 months preceding the top,\" Jones said. \"It kind of doubles whatever the annual averages, and before then, if you don't play it, you're missing out on the juice; if you do play it, you have to have really happy feet, because there will be a really, really bad end to it.\"</p><p>To be sure, Jones isn't predicting an immediate downturn. He believes the bull market still has room to run before it reaches its final phase.</p><p>\"It will take a speculative frenzy for us to elevate those prices. It will take more retail buying. It'll take more recruitment from a variety of others from long short hedge funds, from real money, etc.,\" he said.</p><p>He said he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year to take advantage of the rally fueled by the fear of missing out.</p><p>Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the co-founder of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.</p><p><em>Correction: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. A previous version misstated the percentage.</em></p></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>France's President Emmanuel Macron gestures as he speaks to the press at the end of the 7th European Political Community (EPC) Summit at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark on October 2, 2025.</p><p>Ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron is confronting another massive political headache following the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/frances-new-pm-resigns-as-political-chaos-continues.html\">shock resignation</a> of his Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu — after just 27 days in office.</p><p>The former defense minister and longtime ally resigned on Monday before he'd even laid out his fledgling government's plans, saying he was unable to lead the center-right minority government after talks with rival parties signalled that they were unwilling to compromise over their respective budget and policy demands.</p><p>\"Each political party is behaving as if they have their own majority in parliament,\" Lecornu said, and the \"conditions were not fulfilled\" to stay in office, according to comments translated by France 24.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108207978-1759737981702-1759737753-41969183257-hd.jpg?v=1759737984&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"French Prime Minister resigns, plunging Paris into fresh chaos\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The crisis France finds itself in is largely of Macron's making, with the president confidently dissolving parliament last year in order to bring \"clarity\" to France's divided National Assembly.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/06/france-elections-2024-rise-of-le-pen-shows-scale-of-polarization.html\">The inconclusive elections that followed brought anything but</a>, with both the right and left winning consecutive rounds of voting, leading to a power struggle and political deadlock that has continued ever since. Macron, unwilling to cede government leadership to either side, instead appointed loyalists to lead minority governments but these have proven vulnerable to no-confidence motions from rival parties.</p><p>Lecornu's short-lived government was the third to have failed after the ill-fated administrations of Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou. What they have in common is that they've all struggled to reach agreements with other parties over the state budget, and particularly over the spending cuts and tax rises seen as necessary to rein in France's budget deficit of 5.8% of its gross domestic product in 2024.</p><p>In a surprise twist on Monday evening, Macron gave Lecornu another 48 hours for \"final discussions\" with rival parties to try to break the impasse. Lecornu wrote on X that he will report to the president on Wednesday evening on any potential breakthrough \"so that he can draw all the necessary conclusions.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>What comes next?</h2><p>Macron now faces the unenviable task of deciding what to do next with no option likely to be attractive to the beleaguered president, who has repeatedly said he would not resign, a move that would trigger a new presidential election that's currently not due to take place until 2027.</p><div><p>France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks during a United Nations Summit on Palestinians at UN headquarters during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on September 22, 2025. </p><p>Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>He could choose another prime minister — France's sixth in less than two years — but choosing one not from his own political stable will be an uncomfortable and unedifying prospect for Macron, who has repeatedly picked loyalists to lead government in the last year.</p><p>Or he can dissolve parliament and hold new parliamentary elections. That option won't appeal either as Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally party is currently leading <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/\" target=\"_blank\">voter polls</a>, seen with around 32% of the vote compared to the 25% of the vote being held by left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front.</p><p>Macron is seen as unlikely to choose to resign, analysts say. \"It's too dangerous for him to do the right thing and he's unwilling, of course, to step down from power,\" Douglas Yates, professor of Political Science at INSEAD, told CNBC on Monday.</p><p>\"The one thing I can say with security today is that Macron is not going to announce his own resignation and so it would seem that the easiest thing to do would be to name another prime minister, which he does like I change shirts, and if the new PM doesn't last a long time, he could name another one. And that would be to play his institutional advantage.\"</p><p>Yates did not believe Macron would call fresh elections \"because the last time he did that it was so catastrophic\" and any new polls would again reflect the polarized nature of politics in France, with a chasm between far left and far right voters. \"People would abandon his party and vote with their hearts, either left or right,\" Yates added.</p></div><h2><a></a>Left, or right?</h2><div><p>There is speculation that Macron could take the plunge and nominate a PM who is not an ally from his own centrist political backyard, with a pick from the center-left Socialist Party a possibility.</p><p>There is little chance Macron would opt for a candidate from either the far-left France Unbowed party or far-right National Rally, with both parties on Monday calling for Macron's dismissal.</p></div><div><p>The President of Rassemblement National parliamentary group Marine Le Pen addresses the press upon her arrival at her party's headquarters in Paris, on October 6, 2025.  </p><p>Thomas Samson | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>\"So far he's chosen the wrong person, and by choosing people from the center, he's alienated the left and the right,\" Yates said.</p><p>\"I think he would do better by throwing some fresh meat to the center-left who could help him constitute a government and possibly avoid a motion of censure, so I think a Socialist would probably be the most acceptable, or even one of the Greens' candidates,\" Yates said.</p></div><h2><a></a>And, the budget?</h2><div><p>While political paralysis continues in Paris, the 2026 budget remains in limbo, and economists say it's increasingly likely that this year's budget is rolled into next year as a stop-gap measure.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's Yacine Rouimi on Monday said that if the government collapsed, as it has now, then France would likely operate under a special law, \"maintaining spending near the 2025 framework, with the deficit landing around 5.0–5.4 % of GDP.\"</p><p>\"It's not impossible that we'll see fresh elections soon,\" Rouimi said.</p><p>If Macron does opt to choose a new prime minister from a different party, such as the Socialist Party, that could mean reforms or spending cuts that were tabled by previous administrations, and which failed, could be sliced and slimmed down further.</p><p>Macron \"may appoint a prime minister from the centre-left (or even the far right). However, this would likely open the door to some painful reversals of his previous pro-growth structural reforms (such as the increase in the pension age) and fiscal slippage,\" Salomon Fiedler, economisst at Berenberg Bank, noted in emailed comments on Monday.</p></div></div>",

Not only were some very sophisticated investors willing to pay a premium for EA, but Take-Two has real scarcity value now.\"</p><p>Take-Two is known for a number of popular video game series, namely the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The company is gearing up for a May 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/02/take-two-delays-gta-vi-release-to-may-2026.html\">release</a> of \"Grand Theft Auto VI,\" the latest iteration of the series, which gamers have been anticipating for more than a decade. Its predecessor, \"Grand Theft Auto V,\" is one of the best-selling video games ever, having sold more than 200 million copies since it came out in 2013.</p><p>Take-Two's stock has climbed over the last few months, and shares are currently up 39.6% year-to-date.</p><p>Last week, the company's peer <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EA/\">Electronic Arts</a><span><span></span></span></span> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/ea-shareholders-will-get-210-per-share-in-deal-to-take-company-private.html\">announced</a> it would be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in a deal worth $55 billion. The take-private deal will be the largest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/07/here-are-the-top-10-largest-leveraged-buyouts-in-history.html\">leveraged buyout</a> in Wall Street history. Cramer noted that Electronic Arts' takeover comes two years after <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span> acquired <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/13/microsoft-closes-activision-blizzard-deal-after-regulatory-review.html\">Activision Blizzard</a>, another major American video game publisher.</p><p>According to Cramer, those who want to invest in a traditional video game company now need to enter the Japanese market or \"bet on Take-Two.\" He also said that while Microsoft and Sony have large gaming divisions, most of their sales come from other businesses.</p><p>Cramer also pointed to several aspects of Take-Two's business he finds impressive, including results from its most recent quarter. The company beat Wall Street's estimates and raised its full-year forecast for net bookings. Take-Two said new player accounts for GTA Online have grown more than 50% year-over-year, Cramer noted. He also said the company has other successful franchises beyond GTA, including sports game NBA 2K. The 2025 iteration of the game has already sold more than 11.5 million units, the company said, and daily active users climbed 30% year-over-year. While most of Take-Two's games are played on Playstation, Xbox and PC, Cramer noted its mobile business is growing nicely.</p><p>\"GTA VI\" is likely to be a success, Cramer continued, even if the release date is delayed. If the game is delayed, and the stock takes a hit, he suggested investors use the decline as a buying opportunity.</p><p>\"Just keep in mind, if you're taking the plunge into Take-Two here, you have to be able to stomach any delays to 'GTA VI,'\" he said. \"In fact, you should expect delays — video games aren't like movies, which come out on a regular schedule.\"</p><p>Take-Two did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208574-2ED3-MM-B-BLOCK-100625.jpg?v=1759794259&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Everybody is focused on GTA 6, and for good reason, says Jim Cramer\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

    "body": "Homes in Lexington Waters in Blaine, Minnesota.Michael Siluk | Getty ImagesShares of homebuilders Lennar and Taylor Morrison Home rose on Tuesday following a Bloomberg News report that the two companies were among a cohort working on a proposed \"Trump Homes\" plan aimed at easing the U.S. housing affordability crunch.The two stocks both jumped 4% on Tuesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLEN, TMHC 5D chartBuilders including Lennar and Taylor Morrison Home have discussed a large-scale program that would sell entry-level homes into a pathway-to-ownership program funded by private investors, Bloomberg wrote, citing people familiar with the plan. One version of the plan sees investors renting the homes out to tenants, with a portion of monthly payments counting toward a future down payment should they choose to buy after three years.Amid elevated interest rates and prices, housing affordability has emerged as a key issue for President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Trump said that the U.S. should ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has only exacerbated the housing affordability crisis. The president has also repeatedly said he wants to help first-time buyers, but without triggering a broad decline in existing home prices.\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people who own homes,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The proposal, dubbed \"Trump Homes\" by industry players, could ultimately involve as many as one million homes, Bloomberg reported. A White House official told the outlet that the administration is not actively considering the plan.After a rough year last year, Lennar shares are off to a good start for 2026, up 9%.",

    "body": "Sailors and Marines man the rail as the U.S. Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) is guided by tugboats in San Diego Bay as it returns to its home port of Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California, Dec. 20, 2024.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesThe U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that flew toward the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, according to U.S. Central Command.The incident occurred as tensions in the Middle East are high, with President Donald Trump weighing potential military strikes against the Islamic Republic.   The Shahed-139 drone \"aggressively approached\" the aircraft carrier with \"unclear intent,\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told CNBC in a statement.The Abraham Lincoln was about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when the unmanned aircraft \"unnecessarily maneuvered\" toward the ship, Hawkins said. U.S. forces were operating in international waters and took de-escalatory measures, but the drone continued to fly toward the aircraft carrier, he said. An F-35 warplane from the Abraham Lincoln shot down the drone \"in self defense to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" Hawkins said. No U.S. personnel were harmed and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he said. U.S. crude oil prices were up more than 1% at 2:32 p.m. ET. Hours after the drone was shot down, Iranian forces harassed a U.S. flagged and crewed merchant vessel that was lawfully transiting the Strait of Hormuz, Hawkins said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces threatened to board and seize the M/V Stena Imperative, he said.A U.S. guided missile destroyer intervened and de-escalated the situation and the merchant vessel is now proceeding safely, Hawkins said.Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with strikes if it does not negotiate a deal over its nuclear program. The president threatened to hit the Islamic Republic during mass demonstrations against the regime last month but ultimately held back from strikes. The incidents Tuesday come as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to have discussions with Iranian officials later this week. Those conversations are still scheduled to take place, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview. \"As for the president, he remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first,\" Leavitt said. \"But in order for diplomacy to work of course it takes two to tango. You need a willing partner to engage.\" Leavitt said Trump \"always has a range of options on the table and that includes the use of military force.\" ",

TIS, a major Japanese information technology services provider and systems integrator, plunged over 15%.

Nintendo Co. fans from Tokyo to Manhattan stood in line for hours to be among the first to get a Switch 2, fueling one of the biggest global gadget debuts since the iPhone launches of yesteryear. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNintendo shares plunged more than 10% on Wednesday, a day after the gaming giant missed market estimates for quarterly revenue and as it faces headwinds from an unprecedented memory shortage. The company beat profit estimates though, clocking a 24% jump year on year, bolstered by sales of its Nintendo Switch — now the company's best selling console ever following its release in 2017. Revenue rose 86%.Nintendo is facing pressure this year from a shortage in memory chips — a key component in its gaming consoles — that has resulted in surging prices.  According to Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese Equity Strategy at Ortus Advisors, investors remain concerned about the impact that memory costs will have on the company's margins. While Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said Tuesday that memory price rises were not significantly impacting results for the financial year, he said it could impact profitability if the component costs remain high over the longer term. Nintendo primarily uses dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, in its consoles. This type of memory is suffering from shortages due to growing AI and data center demands. Contract prices for conventional DRAM chips in the first quarter of the year are projected to rise 90% to 95% compared to the previous three months, according to a report from market researcher TrendForce on Monday. Last month, a top semiconductor industry CEO told CNBC that the memory chip shortage was expected to persist through 2027. Despite the memory crunch, Nintendo on Tuesday maintained its full-year Switch 2 sales forecast. Though whether its pipeline of upcoming Switch 2 games will be enough to convince consumers to upgrade to the latest gaming console, released in June last year, remains to be seen.In February, Nintendo plans to release \"Mario Tennis Fever\" for the Switch 2, and \"Pokémon Pokopia\" in March — two titles from its most popular franchises.The company also has \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" set for release in April. The first Super Mario movie released in 2023 had provided a significant boost to Nintendo's console sales, with the company likely hoping for a similar effect on the Switch 2.On Tuesday, James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia, told CNBC that 2026 would be a \"make-or-break\" year for the for Switch 2′s future as Nintendo looks to win more mass market appeal. Nintendo's shares have lost more than 15% so far this year. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report. ",

KKR shares, which lost nearly 10% on Tuesday, gained 0.5% in after hours trading. Global data centers' dealmaking hit a fresh record last year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads, with S&P Global reporting that over $61 billion had flowed into the data center market, up from $60.8 billion last year.\"Digital infrastructure remains one of the most compelling long-term investment themes globally,\" said David Luboff, co-head of KKR Asia Pacific and head of Asia Pacific infrastructure, citing STT GDC's diversified footprint and development pipeline.Citi acted as the lead financial advisor to KKR and Singtel in what marks the largest M&A deal in Singapore in the last four years, data from bank showed.Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Singapore, STT GDC operates data centers across 12 markets in Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom and Europe, with 2.3 gigawatts of design capacity. The company provides colocation, connectivity and support services to hyperscalers and enterprise customers.KKR and Singtel first invested in ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in June 2024, putting in $1.75 billion Singapore dollars for a minority stake.\"STT GDC's diverse geographical footprint increases our exposure to new markets and makes the Singtel Group a stronger data centre player with global reach,\" said Arthur Lang, group chief financial officer at Singtel.",

Investors have been wondering how much Microsoft and other longstanding software companies can grow as corporate workers build new applications using generative artificial intelligence models. Microsoft shares have slipped 15% so far this year, trailing all other Magnificent Seven technology stocks. Last week Microsoft issued Azure cloud growth that came in below some projections. Executives said they want to allocate more computing resources to research and development teams and to its AI products such as the Microsoft 365 Copilot productivity software add-on and the GitHub Copilot coding assistant, while still meeting Azure client demand.\"Judson expanded the remits of his leadership team to free up more time to focus on Microsoft's commercial product strategy and to keep the feedback loop between customers and product decisions as small as possible,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. \"This feedback loop is critical right now because AI is being adopted at extraordinary speed, and our customers expect these capabilities to come to life in their business faster than ever before.\"Deb Cupp, chief revenue officer leading Microsoft's global enterprise sales business, is the company's latest executive vice president, Althoff said in an memo. In recent years, Cupp went from president of Microsoft's U.S. business to president for North America and then to president of the Americas.Nick Parker, chief business officer of worldwide sales and solutions, is becoming an executive vice president as well. He's been at the company since 2000.Ralph Haupter becomes executive vice president and chief revenue officer for small and medium enterprises and channel. Haupter came to Microsoft from IBM in 2005, and he spent four years as CEO and chairman of the Windows and Office company's greater China business.Mala Anand, a former SAP executive who joined Microsoft in 2019, will be executive vice president and chief customer experience officer. The four will continue to report to Althoff, the spokesperson said.Satya Nadella, who was executive vice president before stepping up as Microsoft's CEO since 2014, has concentrated on innovation with Althoff taking on more responsibility. At a software developer event in India in December, he showed off an app he built to research topics using a slew of generative AI models.\"I started my career in a command line, Nadella said on a podcast recorded at the Davos conference in Switzerland in January. \"Who knows?

    "body": "A Chipotle in the Bronx in New York, April 23, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesChipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, although traffic to its restaurants fell for the fourth straight quarter.For 2026, the company is projecting flat same-store sales growth, signaling that the burrito chain's woes are not expected to disappear quickly. Chipotle ended a bumpy 2025 with a full-year same-store sales decline of 1.7%, marking the first annual decline since 2016.However, executives said the outlook is \"conservative,\" citing unpredictable consumer trends. Last year, the company cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales three times as dining habits shifted from quarter to quarter.Shares of the company fell as much as 11% in extended trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 25 cents adjusted vs. 24 cents expectedRevenue: $2.98 billion vs. $2.96 billion expectedThe fast-casual chain reported fourth-quarter net income of $330.9 million, or 25 cents per share, down from $331.8 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment costs, gains from terminating restaurant leases and other items, Chipotle earned 25 cents per share.Net sales rose 4.9% to $2.98 billion.The company's same-store sales fell 2.5% for the quarter, making this reporting period the third quarter of the year with same-store sales declines. However, Wall Street was anticipating a steeper same-store sales decrease of 3%, according to StreetAccount estimates.Traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell by 3.2%. Executives have previously said they have seen a pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift to their behavior.Over the past year, shares of Chipotle have lost roughly a third of their value, dragging the company's market value down to about $51 billion, as of Tuesday's close. Investor enthusiasm for the stock waned after the fast-casual chain began reporting shrinking traffic to its restaurants.To bring back customers, Chipotle is focusing on improving the chain's operations and adding new menu items, rather than leaning into discounts. In December, at the tail end of the quarter, the company unveiled \"protein cups,\" with the goal of convincing protein-obsessed customers to stop by for a snack, not just lunch or dinner.\"I think having a taco at $3.50 and a protein cup around $3.80 across the country is really an approachable price point that really gives the consumer a meaningful way into the brand, but also solves for those people that are looking for a different choice, whether they're GLP-1 users or looking for other dietary restrictions, more high protein or high fiber,\" CEO Scott Boatwright said on a conference call with analysts.Chipotle is trying to raise menu prices at a slower pace than inflation in the hopes of attracting price-conscious consumers. However, the company also has a strong base of high-income customers.\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in income and average household income,\" Boatwright said, adding that the chain plans to target those customers more this year.Chipotle opened 132 company-owned locations and seven restaurants run by international licensees during the quarter. That brought its total to 334 company-owned locations and 11 international partner restaurants opened for the year. In 2026, the company is projecting that it will open 350 to 370 new restaurants, including 10 to 15 international locations that will be run by licensees.",

    "body": "Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, on June 9, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple said it's introducing agentic coding into its flagship coding tool called Xcode, throwing its weight behind one of the hottest trends in Silicon Valley. With agent-powered coding, programmers have artificial intelligence software write code independently. Apple said its tool will support Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex.\"Xcode and coding agents can now work together to handle complex multi-step tasks on your behalf,\" an Apple representative said in a demo video on Tuesday, alongside the announcement. Over the summer, Apple updated Xcode with support for OpenAI's ChatGPT and Claude, but the latest update extends the relationship to agentic coding tools. In an email sent to developers, Apple said the agents will be able to build and test projects, search Apple documentation and fix issues.Individual programmers and companies have embraced agentic coding as a faster way to build software through a practice known as \"vibe coding,\" where humans prompt an AI and review the code it generates. Apple Intelligence, the company's consumer AI suite, has faced delays and management turnover. But in recent months, AI coding has gained traction among iPhone developers. Users will have to connect their OpenAI or Anthropic accounts to Xcode via an API key. Apple said it uses an open standard that gives programmers the ability to use other compatible agents and AI tools with Xcode, in addition to the built-in Anthropic and OpenAI integrations. Apple's Xcode is the company's developer environment for coders, and it is used to build nearly every iPhone app. The new software, Xcode 26.3, is available in a beta version now for registered Apple developers, and will eventually be released on the App Store. OpenAI released a version of its agentic coding application called Codex for Mac computers on Monday.WATCH: Experimenting with AI vibe-codingwatch now",

    "body": "Lisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, Oct. 6, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdvanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped expectations, but the company's first-quarter forecast fell short of what some analysts were expecting amid an AI spending boom. The stock fell Tuesday as much as 8% in extended trading. Here's how the chipmaker did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended in December:EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.32 expectedRevenue: $10.27 billion vs. $9.67 billion expectedFor the first quarter, AMD said it expects $9.8 billion in revenue, plus or minus $300 million, versus expectations of $9.38 billion. Some analysts, however, were expecting AMD to provide stronger guidance as customers continue to ramp up spending for the chips necessary to power AI models. Net income climbed to $1.51 billion, or 92 cents per share, versus $482 million, or 29 cents per share, in the year-ago period. AMD's overall revenue was up 34% on an annual basis. AMD is one of two makers of big graphics processors for artificial intelligence, although it has only a small portion of the market, which is currently dominated by Nvidia. Shares have more than doubled over the past year. The chipmaker has recently announced some big customers, including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Oracle. AMD plans to ship a new integrated server-scale AI system called Helios later this year. AMD CEO Lisa Su said on an earnings call that the company was in \"active discussions\" for additional Helios or MI450 chip sales. \"The ramp is on schedule to start in the second half of the year, and MI450 is doing great,\" Su said. Those sales are reported in the company's data center segment, which had $5.4 billion in sales in the quarter, up 39% on an annual basis. The company said growth was driven by both the company's central processors and its AI GPUs.Su said on the earnings call that the artificial intelligence boom is boosting sales of the company's central processors, not just its GPUs. \"Server CPU demand remains very strong,\" Su said. \"Hyperscalers are expanding their infrastructure to meet growing demand for cloud services in AI, while enterprises are modernizing their data centers to ensure they have the right compute required to enable new AI workflows.\"AMD's client and gaming segment rose 37% year over year to $3.9 billion. The company said it was driven by demand for its Ryzen processors for laptops and PCs, which have gained market share versus Intel. The company's embedded segment grew slower, rising 3% on a year over year basis to $950 million. AMD has faced issues over whether it would be able to ship its AI chips to China because of U.S. export controls. The company on Tuesday said that it recorded $390 million in China sales of its Instinct MI308 chips during the fourth quarter and expects $100 million in China revenue in the current quarter.

We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places ... the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Trump said in that interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump: If states can't run elections 'honestly,' then 'somebody else should take over'Trump signs bill ending federal government shutdownSen.

Trump has urged congressional Republicans to pass that bill.States are primarily responsible for governing their own election systems under the U.S. Constitution. When asked about that fact on Tuesday, Trump replied, \"They can administer the election, but they have to do it honestly.\"He also said, \"If you think about it, a state is an agent for the federal government in elections. I don't know why the federal government doesn't do them anyway. But when you see some of these states about, how horribly they run their elections, what a disgrace it is.\"Trump echoed his frequent claim that elections in the 2020 cycle — when he lost his reelection bid to former President Joe Biden — were \"rigged\" and \"crooked.\" There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 elections.\"Take a look at Detroit,\" he said. \"Take a look at Philadelphia.

    "body": "Novo Nordisk signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, US, on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's U.S. shares plummeted Tuesday after the company said it sees sales and profit growth declining this year, hit by lower prices in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for its blockbuster Wegovy and Ozempic in China, Brazil and Canada. Novo's American depositary shares fell as much as 14% in afternoon trading, after a trading halt. The results were published after the closing bell in Copenhagen, where the company has its primary listing, and ahead of the scheduled release early Wednesday.For 2026, the drugmaker sees sales and operating profit both declining between 5% and 13% at constant exchange rates, far worse than analysts had expected.It comes as the Danish drugmaker is fighting to regain its footing in the weight-loss space amid fierce competition.\"In 2026, Novo Nordisk will face pricing headwinds in an increasingly competitive market,\" CEO Mike Doustdar. \"However, we are very encouraged by the promising early uptake from the US launch of Wegovy pill, and we remain confident in our ability to drive volume growth over the coming years.\"The outlook reflects expectations for a sales decline in the U.S., its biggest market, but sales growth ex-U.S. Novo said. \"In 2026, the global GLP-1 market expansion is assumed to continue, enabling Novo Nordisk to increase patient reach and expand volumes,\" the company said in a statement.In 2025, sales increased by 10% and operating profit increased by 6%, in line with the company's latest guidance, which it lowered throughout 2025, citing challenges in the U.S. market.Novo also said that it will roll out Wegovy in more markets in 2026 and expects to introduce the higher 7.2 mg dose in a number of countries.Mounting pressureStock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk stock has seen steep declines over the past year.Novo launched the oral version of the blockbuster weight-loss medicine Wegovy in the U.S. early January, and, despite its promising start, the market is closely watching how Novo Nordisk will fare along with U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which is expected to launch its own weight loss pill in the first half of 2026.\"Investors want to see they are making the most of this lead, particularly in the direct to patient (mostly self-pay or cash pay) channel, closing some of the large gap that widened between them and Lilly in this channel in 2025,\" said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, is losing exclusivity in markets like Canada, Brazil and China in 2026. Together with significant pricing pressure in its largest market, the U.S., analysts had forecast sales growth to moderate this year to single digits after several years of much higher growth.Coming into the print, Barclays analyst James Gordon said the Novo guide was expected to crystalize further downgrades, however could also act as a clearing event given the \"significant investor concern\" about this year's outlook.\"[Guidance] cuts could be at least partly mitigated by investors taking the opportunity to then buy into the Oral Wegovy US launch and Injectable Wegovy potential US volume inflection this year.\"Novo has faced pressure for the past 18 months as rival U.S.-based Eli Lilly's rival weight-loss drug tirzepatide – sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound – resulted in more pronounced weight loss than Novo's medicine, and surpassed Novo in U.S. market share.Ozempic and Wegovy salesNovo and Lilly in November announced a deal with the Trump administration to cut prices for their best-selling drugs, which are expected to increase volumes but ultimately hurt total sales. The agreements involved cutting prices of their GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid in 2026 as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the forthcoming TrumpRx.gov website, expected to launch in January.In the fourth quarter, Novo net sales amounted to 79.1 billion Danish kroner ($12.5 billion), slightly ahead of analysts' expectations of 77.8 billion kroner, according to LSEG estimates. Operating profit in the quarter was largely in line with estimates at 31.7 billlion kroner, down 14% year-on-year.Ozempic, its best-selling medicine, brought in 31.8 billion in the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year at constant exchange rates. Wegovy sales were 21.9 billion kroner, up 17%.- CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report",

    "body": "Workers of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA operating pumpjack in Lake Maracaibo, in Cabimas, Venezuela, Jan. 27, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersThe Trump administration could issue a general license as soon as this week for companies to produce oil and gas in Venezuela, a person familiar with the plan told CNBC on Tuesday.Chevron is the only U.S. company currently allowed to pump oil in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron has several joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to repair Venezuela's energy industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Jan. 3. \"The President's team is working around the clock to ensure oil companies are able to make investments in Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Stay tuned,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement. Bloomberg first reported the news. Last week, the Treasury Department issued a general license that allowed U.S. companies to buy, sell, transport and refine Venezuelan crude oil, among other activities. But that license did not include upstream production. Companies were previously barred from these activities under U.S. sanctions. The Venezuelan government last week also passed reforms to ease state control of its oil industry and give more autonomy to private companies. The oil industry's response to investing in Venezuela has been mixed. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that the country needs big reforms and is \"uninvestable\" under its current system. Exxon has had its assets seized twice by the government in Caracas. Private wildcatters and smaller shale oil companies have shown more enthusiasm about the potential opportunity in the South American nation. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told CNBC last week that it can ramp up production in Venezuela by 50% in the next 18 to 24 months with approvals from the U.S. It currently produces about 250,000 barrels per day in the South American nation. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world. ",

    "body": "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, during a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDemocrats on the Senate Banking Committee demanded that Chair Tim Scott delay the nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve until a pair of investigations into central bank Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lisa Cook conclude. The Department of Justice is investigating potential criminal wrongdoing by Powell related to cost overruns on the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. They are separately probing Cook, whom President Donald Trump has tried to fire, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Trump nominated Warsh last week to succeed Powell at the end of his term in May. The Democratic resistance all but assures that any one Republican senator will be able to hold up Warsh's confirmation until the probes end. The Banking Committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection on a nomination, along with all Democrats, will deadlock the panel and prevent the nomination from reaching the floor.\"We demand that you delay any nomination proceedings for Mr. Warsh until after the pretextual criminal investigations involving Chair Powell and Governor Cook have been closed,\" the Democratic senators, led by ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote.

But they have help from Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a Banking Committee member who has vowed to stonewall any Fed nominees until the investigation concludes. \"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved,\" Tillis said on X after the Warsh nomination was announced.

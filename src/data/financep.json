    "body": "Around 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026, new LinkedIn research finds. Filadendron | E+ | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a \"critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,\" as it speeds up processes. \"Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,\" she said. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. \"We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,\" Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. \"The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.\"Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,\" Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. Chamberlin says AI is a \"big part of the solution,\" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. Avoid sending generic applications The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to \"be targeted\" when crafting your resume and cover letter. \"Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,\" she said. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.\"In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,\" she said. \"If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.\"Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.",

    "body": "Mornings are one of the most underestimated aspects of a relationship. For many working couples, they're something to rush through on the way to the day ahead. Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days.But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. Here's what they do differently that most neglect.1. They resist the urge to rush past each otherYour partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode.That often means making eye contact when saying \"good morning\" or sharing coffee or tea together without distractions. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small \"bids\" for attention that signal recognition and care.Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun.2. They sync before they speakMornings aren't ideal for heavy conversations. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more.The happiest couples understand this intuitively. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines.Even a few moments of silent togetherness can regulate the nervous system and make the day feel more manageable.3. They exchange one honest sentence about how they're feelingRather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings:\"I'm feeling a bit anxious about today.\"\"I'm excited but exhausted.\"\"I'm not fully awake yet.\"They're not revolutionary, but they're necessary for giving context to moods and behavior the other will see later on. It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day.4. They keep one small morning ritual sacredThis could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. The point is for it to be simple enough for you to repeat daily without struggle.Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call \"our thing\" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple.5. They use touch to regulate, not just to say goodbyeIn many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. They use touch intentionally to ground themselves.Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate.6. They treat mornings as a shared system, not a solo sprintMornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load.Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill.7. They send each other into the day feeling supportedBefore parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support:\"Good luck with your presentation today.\"\"You've got this.\"\"Text me if you need a pep talk.\"While they won't change the day's demands, they can make the demands feel easier to manage. More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "At the start of a new year, it's hard not to get swept up in the allure of New Year's resolutions: Setting goals you want to achieve or pinpointing the bad habits you want to break. For many people, breaking bad habits can be easier when you swap a not-so-great behavior out for a healthier option, Margaret Moore, founder of Wellcoaches Corporation, a school for coaches of healthcare and well-being experts, told CNBC Make It in 2023.Neuroscientist Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD, suggests trying \"tiny experiments\" with habits you'd like to introduce into your life instead of setting huge goals that can be unrealistic. It's significant to \"withhold judgment until you're done conducting your experiment,\" Le Cunff told CNBC Make It last week.In 2026, I'm simply looking to do less. My past few years have involved starting each day with a minimum of 10 items on my to-do list. This year I want to get that list down to five tasks, or less.I talked to my fellow CNBC Make It staff members about the bad habits they want to break this year and there were a few common themes. Here's what stood out.Screen time and tech\"A habit I would like to break this new year is waking up and reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. It's something that has been like muscle memory for such a long time now that I can't remember a time where I didn't wake up and immediately grab my phone and check messages or scroll on social media.\"\"I'd also like to do more mentally stimulating activities when I'm bored instead of just reaching for my phone or watching TV, or just doing things that aren't really challenging my mind in a way.\"— Ashton Jackson, Success Reporter\"I want to fix my sleep. I have not been sleeping right, and I want to fix that. I think I'm just not sleeping enough, and also being on a screen too much before bed. A lot of it is doom scrolling. My other thing is if I'm trying to read and wind down before bed, I read e-books and that screen issue has kind of been a thing too.\"— Sarah Jackson, Work Reporter\"I'm avoiding video games for January. So if I feel like going to play a video game, I play music or I'll read a book.\"— Mike Winters, Money Reporter'Revenge bedtime'Staying up late for extra free time, even when it cuts into the hours you'd otherwise use to sleep and feel rested the next day, is called revenge bedtime. \"It often happens when individuals feel they have little control over their daily schedules,\" according to the Sleep Foundation.\"I'm very bad about watching TV until like 12:30, so I want to have a harsh 'Get into bed,' no later than 11 [p.m.] And I think that will help me break a lot of other bad habits that I have. Like after work being too tired to be productive or do things, I think if I get my sleep on track, it will help with having energy to exercise or be productive after work.\"— Marisa Forziati, Video Editor\"Going to sleep earlier is a big one. It's just tough because with little kids, it's like after they go to sleep at 8' o clock then that feels like freedom. It's the push and pull of wanting to maximize that time with free time, but then also needing to go to sleep. Trying to find that balance of making space to unwind but also to get good rest.\"— Tom Huddleston Jr., Senior Success ReporterNo more abandoning healthy habits\"One habit that I want to stop doing is getting lazy about reading. That's like the hardest thing to force myself to do. I lowered my quota of books for the year to 10 from 12 because I was like maybe if it's 10, I'll actually do it.\"— Gili Malinsky, Lead Psychology Reporter\"Not skipping my workouts, eating sugar or pressing snooze. Trying to get up when the alarm goes off.\" — Kamaron McNair, Money Reporter\"Having less FOMO with my friends. Like if they're going out, I don't have to go this time. If I miss this one social plan, I'm not going to lose this friend, I don't think. I hope not. I have a hard time saying no to invitations to things.\"— Raffi Paul, Video Producer\"I'm trying to walk more. I take the train to work usually but if I can walk home, that adds a bunch of steps to my day.\"— Natalie Wu, Associate Money ReporterAs you look to break habits that don't suit you, Moore reminds you to leave some room for grace, especially if you're a very disciplined person.\"There's a part of you that needs to be free, and indulgent, and impulsive, and enjoy life,\" she said.And if you're struggling to keep up with the changes you're making to your routine, \"there's nothing inherently wrong with not being ready,\" Moore added. \"You're just not ready. You don't have enough motivation, and you have too many obstacles.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Farcia Harvey considers herself to be pretty well traveled. The 27-year-old has crossed off New York City, New Orleans for Mardi Gras, Barcelona and Madrid from her travel bucket list. But one of her favorite trips was her 2024 birthday trip to Cincinnati, of all places.\"I think about that trip to Cincinnati genuinely all of the time,\" Harvey tells CNBC Make It, saying she wanted somewhere not too far from her home at the time in Nashville, but not a staycation either. \"It's one of the best memories I have for my birthday, and it's something that to this day, me and my friends still talk about.\"Some of her highlights were hitting the Somerset outdoor bar, Brown Bear Bakery, the Riverfront's walking paths and the city's free streetcar downtown — simpler and slower luxuries that bigger cities may not offer.Her social media posts hyping Cincinnati and under-the-radar cities last summer went viral with over 1 million views on Instagram and Tiktok, prompting thousands of comments shouting out other secondary cities worth a visit.Harvey's love of hidden gem travel is part of a bigger trend where vacationers are seeking slower, more enriching trips away from the busyness of big-city destinations.\"A lot of people truly believe in order to be well traveled, they have to see Europe, they have to see Africa, all of these other places,\" Harvey says. That may be true for some, but not all, she says: \"You can have a great time in the middle of nowhere.\" Farcia Harvey says a birthday road trip from Nashville to Cincinnati was the most memorable vacation she's taken, despite having traveled to major cities around the world.Kaitlyn FitzpatrickSlow travel meets the farmFarm-stay vacations, in particular, are seeing a boom: 84% of travelers said they're interested in staying on or near a farm, according to a recent report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. Interest in rural escapes has boomed for Gen Z travelers over the past two years, with a 300% spike year-over-year in guest reviews mentioning farms on Vrbo.Even life milestone celebrations are getting the slow travel treatment. Aricka Giglia, 28, gathered 10 of her best girlfriends for her bachelorette at a farm outside Dallas last spring.The LA resident wanted her bachelorette to feel more like a wellness retreat than a typical party weekend. But finding the right venue was the challenge.Aricka Giglia of LA hosted her bachelorette on a farm outside Dallas last spring.Courtesy of Aricka GigliaShe ended up booking a three-night stay at Lavender Hill Farmhouse, drawn to its features of a chicken coop, fields with cows and horses, a pond with paddle boats, an outdoor grill where they hosted a hibachi dinner, and a big kitchen where they invited a private chef for another.\"I don't think any of us have traveled intentionally to be with nature,\" Giglia says. \"If it's nature, it's tropical, but it's never a farm.\"\"It's this slow travel movement. People just want a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. \"Specifically they're looking for access to nature walks, hiking, but then, very specific to farm stays, they want a chance to interact with farm animals.\"The unconventional stay was also affordable, Giglia says, estimating her guests paid about $250 each for the weekend — a steal compared to her husband's bachelor party in Los Cabos, Mexico, that ran about $800 per head.Going big on reading retreatsGroup trips at under-the-radar cities have become a big part of Mackenzie Newcomb's business running the Bad Bitch Book Club from New York City.The club, started in 2018, launched its annual summer camp trip for readers to meet in-person in July 2021. About 28 people showed up at the Northern Outdoors campgrounds in Forks, Maine. It was such a hit that the club now hosts reading trips across the U.S. once a month that cost between $900 to $1,500 for basic room packages and a weekend of meals and activities. Last year, BBBC hosted three weeks of summer camp; 400 people applied for 200 spots, Newcomb, 32, says.The Bad Bitch Book Club's annual summer retreat attracts hundreds of people for a weekend of reading and socializing.Courtesy of Mackenzie NewcombDemand is likely to grow: 91% of travelers saying they're interested in taking a trip centered around reading, relaxation and quality time, according to Expedia's travel trends report. Mentions of reading-related terms in Vrbo guest reviews has surged 285% year-over-year, and searches for \"book retreats\" and \"book club retreat ideas\" are up on Pinterest.\"I'm going to credit Booktok with the dramatic rise in what Vrbo is calling 'readaways,'\" says Fish, the travel expert. \"Groups are headed to these serene destinations, coastal homes, country retreats, or just cozy, multi-bedroom getaways with a porch swing that they're dying to curl up in, and their goal is to read.\" There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view.Mackenzie NewcombCEO and founder of the Bad Bitch Book ClubWhen choosing the right location for a reading retreat, splashier cities aren't always the best move, Newcomb says.Newcomb's least favorite retreats were in Nashville and New Orleans, great cities in their own right, but not good for a reading trip \"because it's all about exploring and not at all about relaxing,\" she says. \"There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view. When I'm looking for homes, I tend to look for places that people would be just as happy just being in that rental house the entire weekend reading as they would going out and exploring the area.\"To that end, some of her favorite lit trips have taken place in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Savannah, Georgia; Door County, Wisconsin; Holland, Michigan; The Berkshires in Massachusetts; and Mount Snow, Vermont.Hocking Hills, Ohio, about an hour south of Columbus, is \"a strong contender for a future trip,\" Newcomb says, adding that members have been \"vouching very strongly\" for a book club retreat there for years. \"And of course I'm like, 'I don't want to go to Ohio,' but they insist that it's going to be the place to go.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from members of the media during a meeting with oil and gas executives in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 9, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that aims to block the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.The executive order states that the revenue, which is held in foreign government deposit funds, are \"held solely for sovereign purposes\" and that any court attempt to seize the funds will \"materially harm the national security and foreign policy\" of the U.S. The order, which declared a national emergency, said the funds are the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic means, and are not assets subject to private claims. Any use of judicial process against the funds will interfere with efforts to \"ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the order says.Trump signed the order nearly one week after U.S. military forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas. Both were indicted on drug-trafficking charges and have pleaded not guilty. Since the military operation, Trump has said that both nations \"are working well together\" on rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure and that American oil giants will invest at least $100 billion in the South American country.Trump met with major oil industry executives on Friday afternoon in an effort to get U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. In that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that right now Venezuela is \"uninvestable.\"ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil exited Venezuela after its government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized the country's oil sector along with several other key industries. Both companies have filed arbitration cases against Venezuela seeking billions of dollars in compensation for assets that were expropriated by the government.Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Trump administration.In his Friday order, Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as legal justification for safeguarding Venezuelan oil revenue in U.S. accounts.

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLawmakers this week plan to revisit efforts to pass a market structure bill that will determine the crypto industry's future in the U.S. — reviving legislative efforts that stagnated last year.On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to hold hearings on their respective parts of the crypto bill, where they might revise the text. This will lay the groundwork for establishing legislative guardrails for digital assets in the U.S. — a potential watershed moment for the crypto industry. This is what you need to know about the market structure bill and efforts to pass it. The bill's objectiveThe so-called Clarity Act aims to provide legislative guardrails for the multitrillion-dollar crypto market and big digital asset firms — which could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto in the U.S. It seeks to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's and Commodities Futures Trading Commission's roles in regulating cryptocurrencies, in addition to creating more well-defined token classifications. It also aims to outline registration and compliance standards for a wide range of crypto brokerages, exchanges and other entities, enabling them to operate more easily in the U.S. Those guardrails could help the U.S. court more digital assets companies to set up shop stateside, stimulating the economy and boosting the crypto market, according to Summer Mersinger, CEO of crypto trade group Blockchain Association.\"We've seen this massive movement of companies and activity back on shore because there is a friendly administration to crypto,\" Mersinger said. But, without a market structure law, \"that could all go away, especially if there's a change to an unfriendly administration.\"That said, the bill's implications for digital asset companies, crypto holders and other investors won't be 100% clear until the draft legislation's language is finalized. What's happening this weekLawmakers will attempt to hash out three key issues this week: stablecoin-linked rewards; the treatment of decentralized finance platforms and their developers; and the matter of blocking elected officials such as President Donald Trump from profiting off of crypto ventures. Trump-affiliated entities have launched both a memecoin and nonfungible token in the past. The stablecoin issue is \"the biggest outstanding issue\" for negotiations on the Hill, said Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber.\"Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill,\" Carbone said. \"Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.\"In early January, the American Bankers Association's Community Bankers Council wrote to Senate members, asking them to prevent stablecoin issuer affiliates from offering rewards to customers. The stablecoin products, they said, exploit a loophole in the stablecoin-centric Genius Act passed last year that prohibits dollar-pegged tokens that offer yields to holders — which pose an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts and other traditional products. On the DeFi front, crypto advocates are fighting to ensure developers do not face prosecution when their technology is used for illicit activities like money laundering. \"We're very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill… but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn't some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can't comply,\" DeFi Education Fund chief legal officer Amanda Tuminelli told CNBC. DeFi advocates also want to ensure the market structure bill contains language allowing individuals to self-custody their crypto. In addition, they want provisions from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that call for software developers and blockchain service providers who do not control or custody customer funds to be exempt from registering as money-transmitting businesses. Finally, some lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) want to prevent public officials from profiting off of digital asset ventures while they serve. \" It's a really hard issue,\" Mersinger said. \"They ended up kind of punting [on] it in the House because it was really difficult to put on the bill. A lot of Senate Democrats have said, 'We're not going to punt on this issue.'\" 'Key window'The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to put out new drafts of the market structure bill, with the aim of discussing and revising details of the proposed legislation Thursday at markup, according to Mersinger. Later, they will join the two documents to create one big crypto bill. That draft will go to the Senate floor, where discussions could take several weeks, before potentially making its way through the rest of the lawmaking process to become law. Crypto proponents want to see the bill passed before the 2026 midterm elections in case some of the industry's allies are unseated in November and to avoid losing momentum on the Hill, Mersinger told CNBC. \"There's a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year, and so this is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that's needed to get it done,\" Mersinger said. ",

    "body": "A Walmart sign hangs on the exterior of the store on Nov. 20, 2025 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWalmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club.Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with \"Instant Checkout,\" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" Furner said in a news release. \"We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.\"In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is \"rewriting the retail playbook\" and, with AI, it's \"trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.\"Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a \"transformative\" moment.For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI \"helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.\" \"Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,\" he said.Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that \"it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.\"",

    "body": "watch nowLeading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,\" Woods told Trump at the White House. \"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable.\" Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\"As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,\" Lance told the president. Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. \"We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,\" Nelson told Trump. \"We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. \"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\"",

    "body": "The IBM logo at the headquarters of IBM Germany in the Highlight Towers in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria). Mattias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesIn a time of geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some steady portfolio income.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive stocks of companies that generate solid cash flows to support continued dividend payments.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Permian ResourcesWe start this week with Permian Resources (PR), an independent oil and natural gas company with assets in the Permian Basin, with a concentration in the core of the Delaware Basin. At a base dividend of 15 cents per share (an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share), PR stock offers a dividend yield of 4.3%.In a recent research report, Siebert Williams analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price forecast of $19, saying, \"Extending track record of operational execution with a near-term focus on 4Q25, where the implied oil production guidance midpoint is ~187.4 Mbbls/d on a capex of $484.6 mn.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.Sorbara noted that Permian is sticking to its plan to reward shareholders through a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share and opportunistic stock buybacks. Notably, the company has a $1 billion buyback authorization with no end date. The five-star analyst expects Permian to raise its dividend next year and beyond. Meanwhile, Sorbara expects the company to release its 2026 outlook in February once it finalizes a plan that fits the commodity price and service cost backdrop. The analyst expects Permian to benefit from several positives in 2026, including lower drilling costs, an increased production base in the second half of last year, steady operational strength, and better pricing from recent deals. Sorbara expects these tailwinds to drive efficiency in production, capital spending and free cash flow.Additionally, Sorbara noted Permian's efforts to further strengthen its balance sheet, aiming for a long term net-debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) target of 0.5x-1.0x. Also, the $500 million to $1 billion of cash on hand gives the company flexibility to execute capital allocation options like acquisitions, buybacks, and debt reduction even at West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the range of $35 to $40/bbl.Sorbara ranks No. 522 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.4%. See Permian Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.International Business MachinesTech giant IBM (IBM) is this week's second dividend pick. The company returned $1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in the third quarter of 2025. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.2%.Recently, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded IBM stock to buy from hold and raised the price target to $360 from $300, citing \"a clearer path to software acceleration, improving fundamentals, and valuation not yet fully reflecting the software premium.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $354.The five-star analyst noted management's more favorable outlook across key growth areas, with tech transformation and rapid AI adoption fueling broad-based demand. Thill noted that improving regulatory and tax policies, solid organic software growth, synergies from recent mergers and acquisitions and key wins in generative AI consulting are also supporting management's optimism.Notably, synergies from the HashiCorp acquisition and the pending Confluent (CFLT) deal are expected to drive accelerated software growth in 2026 compared to just under 10% exiting 2025. Thill also expects IBM to deliver consistently improving margins (estimates pretax margin of 21% in 2027 compared to 19% in 2025), driven by a growing software mix and operational discipline.With IBM trading at 26x 2027 P/E multiple, compared to the large-cap software peer average of 35x, Thill finds the stock's valuation attractive and contends that it still has upside as the software reacceleration expectation is not priced in.Thill ranks No. 539 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See IBM Statistics on TipRanks. Kinetik HoldingsKinetik Holdings (KNTK) is a midstream energy company focused on the Delaware Basin in the Permian. With a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share (an annualized dividend of $3.12 per share), KNTK stock offers a yield of 8.5%.On Jan. 5, Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins upgraded Kinetik stock to buy from hold with a price target of $46. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating with a price target of $34.\"The stock is down ~38% TTM, and the magnitude of that reset is a core component of our thesis as investor focus shifts toward 2026-27, where operational visibility improves while valuation continues to reflect meaningful skepticism,\" said Jenkins.Jenkins believes that KNTK's risk-reward is getting more attractive, with the earnings outlook for 2026 to 2027 becoming clearer. The improving earnings expectations are backed by more meaningful full-year contributions from the Kings Landing project and better system connectivity as the ECCC pipeline moves toward its Q2 2026 start-up.The analyst's optimism is also backed by its acid-gas injection project, planned for late 2026, which will open access to more sour gas and ease utilization constraints in the Delaware system. Jenkins also expects several macro and operational factors that affected 2025 performance to improve into mid-2026, including Waha price conditions and additional volumes tied to Permian dry gas expansion.Trading at about 8x 2027 EV/EBITDA, at the low end of the midstream peer group valuation range of 8x to 12x, Jenkins finds KNTK stock attractive, with the balance sheet getting stronger after the divestiture of its equity interest in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP. Interestingly, Jenkins sees the possibility of KNTK being a buyout target for midstream companies that want to combine more Permian NGL (natural gas liquids) volumes.Jenkins ranks No. 63 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.1%. See Kinetik Holdings Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

One is a 1963 Chevrolet K20. The other is a new Silverado EV. The trucks, while part of a temporary holiday display, are symbolic of what's inside the new global offices for the Detroit automaker: its past and present, woven together.GM is occupying four of six office floors of the building and has filled them with artifacts, design nods and \"Easter eggs\" tied to the Detroit automaker's history. They range from a blueprint of GM's iconic design dome and an early map of its nearby proving grounds to an interior wallpaper of 300 patented technologies and a decorative wall of cassette tapes with songs featuring the automaker's brands as well playful references to executive stalwarts such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.One of the centerpiece objects of GM's new headquarters is the McCormick Speed Form, an aerodynamic wind-tunnel model developed at the Warren Technical Center.Courtesy: GM\"Leadership asked when we were helping design the space to bring in some Easter eggs and details to represent who we are at GM, you know, honoring our culture and our history and our innovation,\" Rebecca Waldmeir, GM industrial design architecture and experience manager, told CNBC during a tour of the new headquarters.Other surprises include references to relevant Detroit streets, design influences from GM's famed design campus in suburban Detroit and artwork and sculptures of its products.Aside from the aesthetics, GM officials say the new offices will assist with collaboration and are more relevant to how the company expects its employees to work in a post-pandemic world. It will house executive offices and other corporate functions such as marketing, legal and finance.\"A headquarters really should be, at some level, a beacon for the culture of the company,\" said David Massaron, GM vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. \"When you come in here, it should help people understand who we want to be.\"A wall inside GM's new Detroit headquarters includes cassette tape cases featuring songs referencing the automaker's brands and vehicles as well as custom ones featuring GM executives such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.Michael Wayland | CNBCFrom fortress to functionalityThe new headquarters marks a significant square-foot reduction for the automaker's corporate office — from a towering complex called the Renaissance Center along the city's riverfront to just four floors, roughly 200,000 square feet, in the new building.GM's new HQ is less than a mile from the RenCen, as it's commonly called, which has been a symbol for the city since, ironically, Ford Motor built the complex but decided not to make it its headquarters in the 1970s. GM purchased the building in 1996 as its third headquarters, all of which have been in the Motor City.The RenCen is Detroit's fortress, a 5.6-million-square-foot complex complete with a more-than-700-foot center tower surrounded by four 500-foot towers and two smaller adjacent ones. GM's new headquarters at the Hudson's Detroit development in the city's downtown.Courtesy: GMThe complex is infamously difficult to get in and out of and to navigate. For much of its existence, it was surrounded by concrete barriers before a redesign around the turn of the millennium. It has long been something of a physical permutation of GM's historically siloed culture, which Barra has made a priority to change during her roughly 11-year tenure as CEO.\"The RenCen was designed in a different era, in a pre-Covid era where everybody went to work five days a week, everybody went to their desk,\" Massaron said. \"Particularly, in a post-pandemic world, you need office space that people want to come to, because we have options.\"GM's roughly 50,000 U.S. salaried employees are currently required to work in-office Tuesday through Thursday, but the rules are more flexible than before regarding location and remote working. The Renaissance Center (complex of skyscrapers with the Chrevrolet sign) by the Detroit River.Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMost of the company's new executive offices on the top floor of the building will be open for executives to use as they please, Massaron said. Only four of the offices will be permanently assigned to top GM executives, such as Barra and Reuss, he said.GM declined to disclose how many employees are expected to regularly work at the new headquarters, saying foot traffic will fluctuate based on priorities and workflows. The company also declined to disclose financial details of its 15-year lease at the new headquarters.The building complex, known as Hudson's Detroit, is owned by a real estate company of Rocket Companies chairman and billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been purchasing and renovating properties in Detroit for more than a decade.Showroom, pickleball Aside from the office areas and the executive floor, which all overlook an open atrium, GM also plans to open a semi-public space to display products and host events on the first floor of the building. Other amenities include social gathering areas and lounges, food and beverage services and a pickleball court and recreation area. A common area outside of the executive offices of GM's new headquarters in downtown Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM's new headquarters, which remains under construction, comes months after Ford christened a new 2.1-million-square-foot global HQ and product design and development center in nearby Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's new facility includes offices, design and industrial operations and a host of amenities such as a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts,\" multiple courtyards and other upgrades.The notable difference in the size between GM's and Ford's new headquarters comes down to location, headcount and the automakers' portfolios of offices and operations throughout the region.A pickleball court and seating area inside the building that includes GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM, for example, has a vast technology and design center that occupies 710 acres in nearby Warren, Michigan. That campus houses more than 24,000 employees.

    "body": "Maskot | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesA cooling labor market, characterized by sluggish hiring and anemic job creation, made it hard for job seekers to find work in 2025, according to economists. \"It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note Friday. That recession affects both blue- and white-collar workers, she wrote. U.S. employers added 584,000 jobs last year, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report issued Friday. That marks the worst year for total job gains outside of a recession since 2003, according to Long. There has been little job creation since April, meaning most gains took place early in the year, she wrote. watch nowMost hiring has also been concentrated in the health-care sector, making it difficult for workers to participate across the broad labor market, economists said. \"Healthcare alone accounted for roughly 69% of all job growth across 2025,\" Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter, wrote in a note Friday. \"The reliance on a single industry to keep job growth positive uncovers the unstable foundation in play going into 2026.\"Long-term unemployment has also climbed. In December, 26% of all unemployed workers had been out of work for at least six months, the highest share since February 2022, according to the BLS. That suggests \"unemployment is increasingly becoming a permanent state rather than a temporary transition,\" Bachaud said.On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the hiring rate had fallen to 3.2% in November. That's one of the lowest rates since 2013, according to Long. Job market likely to remain cool for monthsOverall, the current state of the labor market shows a stark turnaround from the scorching market of 2021 and 2022. At that time, the so-called \"great resignation\" was in full swing, with job openings at record highs, pay growth at its highest in decades and workers able to leave their jobs in droves for better positions. Economists called that labor market, in which workers enjoyed considerable leverage, unsustainable over the long run.

While the hiring recession will likely continue in the first half of 2026, the second half should be better for job seekers, due to tax cuts, lower interest rates and a clearer tariff picture, Long wrote. How job seekers can stand outThere are ways for job seekers to improve their chances at landing a new position, even in a lackluster hiring environment, according to job experts.1. Highlight your skills — and leverage AI to helpEmployers and recruiters have gradually shifted to so-called \"skills-based hiring,\" meaning they prioritize a candidate's skills and experience rather than educational attainment, said Sam DeMase, a career expert at ZipRecruiter.ZipRecruiter data shows 88% of entry-level jobs omit degree requirements in the job description, and about 70% of recently hired workers have less than a bachelor's degree, said DeMase. \"Many employers want to hire folks who can hit the ground running immediately,\" she said. Job seekers should ensure there's \"strong\" alignment between the job description and the experience and skill sets they outline on their resumes and cover letters, DeMase said. This helps candidates stand out with recruiters and make it through the automated applicant tracking systems on which employers increasingly rely to sort applications, she said. DeMase gave an example of what candidates can write to highlight value proposition: \"Using my background in X, I helped companies achieve Y.\" For example: \"Using my background in digital marketing and extensive background in data analysis and content planning, I helped companies craft innovative campaigns that attract and delight the ideal audience and drive revenue.\"Generic skills statements like \"I have good people skills and attention to detail\" won't work well in 2026, she said. Priya Rathod, a career expert at job site Indeed, recommends that applicants use artificial intelligence to match keywords in job descriptions with those in their resume. This helps applicants get through the first round of resume screening, she said. 2. Target job sectors that are growingIt's important for job seekers to follow employer demand, said Rathod.Workers should target certain areas of the job market that are growing, including health care, skilled trades, infrastructure and revenue-critical jobs, especially within technology, she said.\"Getting hired in 2026 isn't necessarily about applying everywhere,\" Rathod said. \"It's really about aligning your skills and where employers are actually investing.\"For example, a worker with a sales background may not have specific experience in health-care sales, but they can play up their sales skills in an application, Rathod said.Think about transferable skills, and work to upskill via additional credentials, licenses or certifications to fill in any gaps, she said. 3. Networking is your friendDon't ignore the value of networking, Rathod said. Whether a person has a job, is unemployed, or has a part-time role and is looking for full-time work, \"networking is always going to be one of your best friends,\" she said. This can take several forms: Engaging with industry and community organizations, and talking to friends and colleagues, either in person or online, she said.4. Ignore the one-page resume 'myth'DeMase recommends certain nuts-and-bolts resume formatting guidelines to further help make it through applicant tracking system firewalls. For instance, resumes should be in a single-column format with clearly labeled sections, including a headline, about me, achievements, work experience, areas of expertise and education, if applicable, she said. Resumes don't need to be limited to one page.\"There's a myth about the one-page resume,\" she said. \"Don't sacrifice experience to shorten your resume.\"A resume can be two pages for people with five to 10 years of experience, and three pages for those with more than 10 years of experience, DeMase said. These aren't hard and fast rules, however, and may differ based on industry.",

    "body": "Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has a nightly ritual that helps her stay confident while running her baby formula business, she said in an Oct. 7 episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast.Every night, Modi does a \"personal and professional check-in,\" and mentally ranks her day on a scale of one to five from both perspectives, she said. The routine helps her reflect and process her feelings as she gets ready for bed, she added.\"There's moments where you have to take the internal check-in and remind yourself that you're being human, that's OK, and then put your thick skin back on,\" said Modi.Modi, a former director of host operations at Airbnb, quit her job to co-found Bobbie in 2018. After having her first child two years earlier, she was frustrated by ingredients found in typical baby formulas, she told CNBC Make It in July 2023. The company, which sells organic U.S.-made baby formula, brings in an estimated $64.84 million per year in revenue and has raised approximately $185.01 million in total equity funding, according to FactSet.While Modi has always had thick skin, she said, her nightly check-ins help her celebrate her wins and recover from rough days while growing her company and raising her family, she said.\"I think sometimes you have to regulate your feelings and emotions on a wild ride, personally and professionally,\" said Modi, now the mother of four children. \"The good months or the good years come and go [and] the daily moments just allow me to stay focused and grounded.\"Former Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg had a similar emotional regulation habit while at the helm of company, which he ran for seven years before leaving the role in October. Each morning, he'd rank his mood on a scale of one to 10 to help him get in the \"right mood and right energy\" to lead the business, he said at the Fast Company Innovation Festival 2023.His sweet spot was when he felt he between three and seven, he said: That meant he felt \"energized\" and able to work and collaborate at high level. If he felt any lower, he usually secluded himself in his office until he was in a better headspace to work with others, he added.  Learning how to regulate your emotions is a form of emotional intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ), that all leaders need to master, leadership expert Scott Mautz wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2024. Reflecting on your missteps and successes, in particular, can help you build your mental strength, he wrote.\"Mentally strong people understand that we're defined not by what knocks us down, but by how we get back up,\" wrote Mautz. \"They treat mistakes as missteps and not 'mis-leaps' meaning they're careful not to exaggerate the negative impact of a setback.\"  You could take an extra step and write those reflections down in a journal, too. \"Self-reflection through writing provides measurable cognitive and emotional benefits by helping process experiences and clarify thinking,\" psychiatrist Drew Ramsey wrote on March 25.\"Meta-analyses have found that expressive writing can improve both physical and psychological health outcomes,\" he wrote. \"Neuroimaging studies reveal that labeling emotions through writing ...

    "body": "Damircudic | E+ | Getty ImagesAs more older Americans near retirement, many are eager to boost 401(k) savings to combat the rising cost of health care and other day-to-day expenses. And for 2026, there are key 401(k) changes that investors need to know, financial experts say.        This year, \"small 401(k) details matter more than ever,\" said certified financial planner Joon Um with Secure Tax and Accounting in Hayward, California.For 2026, you can defer up to $24,500 into your 401(k) plan, up from $23,500 in 2025. The full plan limit, which includes employer matches, profit sharing and other contributions, is $72,000.There's also a higher 401(k) catch-up contribution limit. In 2026, investors age 50 and older can save an additional $8,000 per year, up from $7,500 in 2025. The \"super catch-up\" limit for savers age 60 to 63 remains at $11,250 for 2026.Individual retirement account contribution limits also rose for 2026.

More than one-third of U.S. adults have delayed or plan to delay retirement, according to a New York Life survey that polled roughly 2,300 adults in September. The top two reasons were not enough savings and inflation.So-called \"defined contribution plans,\" which include 401(k)s, are the primary retirement savings tool for many private sector U.S. workers. These plans covered more than 100,000 million participants in 2023, according to a September report from the Department of Labor.Most don't max out 401(k) plans\"Higher [401(k)] deferral limits are helpful, but only if contributions are actually adjusted,\" Um said.In 2024, some 45% of participants boosted 401(k) deferrals — on their own or as part of their plan's automatic increases — according to Vanguard's 2025 How America Saves report, which is based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants.However, only 14% of participants maxed out their 401(k)s in 2024, and the average combined savings rate, including employer deposits, was an estimated 12%, according to the same report. \"We're encouraging clients to revisit this early in the year,\" Um said.Roth catch-up contributions for higher earnersIf you're age 50 and older, your 401(k) catch-up contributions can be traditional pretax or after-tax Roth, depending on what your plan allows. But starting in 2026, certain higher earners must make Roth catch-up contributions, based on a Secure 2.0 Act of 2022 change.   Neil Krishnaswamy, a CFP and president of Krishna Wealth Planning in McKinney, Texas, has talked with clients about the 401(k) change. In 2026, your 401(k) catch-up contributions generally must be Roth if you earned more than $150,000 from the same employer in 2025. You can find out if this applies to you by reviewing the gross income on your final 2025 paystub, Krishnaswamy said.But the \"Roth mandate\" doesn't apply this year if you started a new job on Jan. 1, 2026, \"even if you earned $1 million at your previous firm,\" he said. You're also exempt if you exceeded the $150,000 threshold via multiple employers.  watch now",

    "body": "A Boeing Co. 737 Max airplane at the company's manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing is set to report this week that it delivered the most airplanes since 2018 last year after it stabilized its production, the clearest sign of a turnaround yet after years of safety crises and snowballing quality defects. Now, the aerospace giant is planning to ramp up production.\"It's a long road back from a ... shall we say, a rather dysfunctional culture, but they're making big progress,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consulting firm.Boeing was forced to scale back production in recent years following two fatal crashes of its popular 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 and a midair blowout of a door plug from one of its planes in the first week of 2024. The Covid pandemic snarled airplane assembly at both Boeing and its chief rival, Airbus, with supply chain delays and loss of experienced workers, even after the worst of the health crisis subsided.A Boeing 737 approaches San Diego International for a landing, May 10, 2025.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesBoeing's leaders, including CEO Kelly Ortberg — a longtime aerospace executive who came out of retirement to take the top job months after the midair door plug accident — are gearing up to increase production this year of its cash cow 737 Max aircraft and the longer-range 787 Dreamliners.That could help the manufacturer, the top U.S. exporter by value, return to profitability, as analysts expect this year, territory that was out of reach for seven years as its leaders focused on damage control and were stuck reassuring frustrated airline executives who were awaiting late planes.Their tone has changed as Boeing has become more predictable and increased production, with the Federal Aviation Administration's blessing. In a sign of the FAA's increased confidence in Boeing, the agency in September said Boeing could issue its own air worthiness certificates before customers receive some of its 737s and 787s after years of restrictions.Boeing's commercial aircraft business is its largest unit, accounting for about 46% of sales in the first nine months of last year, with the rest coming from its defense and services business. Boeing last reported a full-year profit in 2018.Investors are optimistic for further improvement. Boeing shares have gained 36% over the last 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's nearly 20% advance. \"Boeing is definitely better and more stable,\" said Bob Jordan, CEO of all-Boeing airline Southwest Airlines, in an interview Dec. 10. The company is scheduled to outline its production plans for 2026 later this month when it reports quarterly results on Jan. 27.Getting into gearFor Boeing, the recent turnaround has taken place largely on the assembly floor. Under Ortberg, the manufacturer has slashed so-called traveled work, in which assembly tasks are done out of order, to avoid costly mistakes. The company has made other manufacturing changes, as well, including added training.The National Transportation Safety Board in June said inadequate training and management oversight had been among the problems at the company, according to its investigation into what led to the door plug blowout in January 2024.On Dec. 8, Boeing also completed its acquisition of fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, which Boeing had spun out of the company two decades ago. It now has more direct control of the crucial supplier.Moving out jetsBoeing handed over 537 aircraft in the first 11 months of last year. It reports December deliveries on Tuesday, but Jefferies estimates the company delivered 61 commercial jets last month, 44 of them Boeing's bestseller, the 737 Max.Boeing delivered 348 aircraft in 2024 and 528 in 2023. Last year's total would still be far off the 806 airplanes it handed over in 2018.Last October, the FAA raised its production cap on Boeing's 737 Max from 38 a month to 42. (The FAA required its sign-off after the door plug accident.) CFO Jay Malave said at a UBS conference on Dec. 2 that he expects the company to get to that rate in early 2026. Ortberg told investors in October that further rate increases are on the table, in increments of five planes.Kelly Ortberg, chief executive officer of Boeing Co., during a media event at the Boeing Delivery Center in Seattle, Washington, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHandovers to airlines in 2026 will likely be new production, compared with clearing out older inventory, Malave had said. Boeing is also likely to produce about eight Dreamliners a month as of early this year, he added.Deliveries are key for airplane makers, because airlines and other customers pay the bulk of an airplane's price when they receive the aircraft. Boeing's chief competitor, Airbus, is scheduled to report 2025 orders and deliveries on Monday.Still, several planes that were expected to already flying passengers aren't certified yet, including the Boeing 777X as well as the Max 7 and Max 10 variants, depriving Boeing of cash and driving up costs.Southwest is awaiting the delayed Max 7, the smallest plane of the Max family. The model is important for airline routes that have lower demand so airlines can avoid oversupplying the market with seats, pushing down fares.Southwest CEO Jordan last month said that he doesn't expect the airline to fly the Max 7 before the first half of 2027 as Boeing certification work continues. Boeing at one point expected it to enter service in 2019.\"They're still very short in terms of delivering the aircraft that we need, but I'm glad to see the progress on the Max 7,\" Jordan told CNBC. watch nowRobust demandOrders for both Boeing and Airbus jets look solid, with demand set to continue outstripping supply into the next decade, Bernstein aerospace analyst Douglas Harned said in a note last week.Airbus outpaced Boeing in deliveries last year, though Boeing appears to have outsold its European competitor in new orders.Through November, Boeing logged 1,000 gross orders compared with 797 from Airbus. Airline customers have started to look beyond this decade, snagging delivery slots into the mid-2030s as they plot out growth and international expansions.On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it is ordering 105 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets, the longest aircraft of the Max group. Alaska fleet chief Shane Jones told CNBC the order is a sign of \"our confidence in the Max 10 certification\" as well as \"our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.\"  Alaska also exercised options for five 787 Dreamliners for more international routes just over a year after it acquired Hawaiian Airlines — a combination that handed Alaska more Dreamliners and Airbus A330s to reach for destinations that it couldn't get to before, like Japan, South Korea and Italy.The wide-body aircraft market is now picking up steam, said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America, with orders starting to get handed over faster to customers.

More and more global airlines are looking at snagging long-haul jets like Boeing's Dreamliner and Airbus' A330 and A350s for the coming years, heating up the wide-body airplane market, analysts said.Globally, airplanes flew nearly 84% full in November, the highest level on record, according to the latest data available from the International Air Transport Association, an airline industry group.With travel demand still robust, orders to replace older jets and secure new ones will continue to fuel growth.\"The magic, if you will, of air transportation is until somebody comes up with a transporter, you know, [like] 'Star Trek,' where you sort of vaporize and show up someplace else, we're going to be flying,\" Epstein said.",

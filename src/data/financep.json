    "body": "People visit the Red Square in front of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow.Alexander Nemenov | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday confirmed it has blocked Meta's WhatsApp messaging service and said Russians should use a new state-backed platform called Max instead.\"Max is an accessible alternative, a developing messenger, a national messenger. And it is available on the market for citizens,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday, news agency Ria Novosti reported.WhatsApp issued a statement earlier in the day saying Russia had attempted to \"fully block\" its messaging service in the country in order to force people toward Max, which it described as a \"surveillance app.\"\"Today the Russian government attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive people to a state-owned surveillance app,\" WhatsApp posted on social media platform X. \"Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,\" it said, adding: \"We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.\"Russia's latest move against social media platforms and messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram comes amid a wider attempt to drive users toward domestic and more easily controlled and monitored services, such as Max. Russia's telecoms watchdog, Roskomnadzor, has accused messaging apps lTelegram and WhatsApp of failing to comply with Russian legislation requiring companies to store Russian users' data inside the country, and of failing to introduce measures to stop their platforms from being used for allegedly criminal or terrorist purposes. It has used this as a basis for slowing down, or blocking, their operations with restrictions coming into force since last year. Critics say the overarching aim of Russia's strategy is to restrict freedom of expression and privacy and to monitor and control the narrative around the war against Ukraine, and to surveil the public for any criticism of the government and Russian armed forces. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is waiting for a response.Dado Ruvic | ReutersTelegram, founded by Russian developers but headquartered in Dubai, has been a principle target for Roskomnadzor's scrutiny and increasing restrictions, with users reporting sluggish performance on the app since January, the Moscow Times noted this week. Last August, the telecoms watchdog partially restricted calls on Telegram and WhatsApp.Roskomnadzor — formally known as the Federal Service for the Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media — on Wednesday accused Telegram of failing to prevent illicit activity on the app, failing to protect users' data and of violating Russian laws. \"In this regard, by decision of the authorized bodies, Roskomnadzor will continue to introduce successive restrictions in order to ensure compliance with Russian legislation and ensure the protection of citizens,\" it said in a statement reported by the RBC news outlet.Kremlin spokesman Peskov said Wednesday that Roskomnadzor's decision to slow down Telegram's operations was \"due to the fact that the company isn't complying with the requirements of Russian legislation.\"\"It's a shame the company isn't complying, but there's a law that must be followed,\" Peskov told state news agency TASS.Russia's telecom watchdog said Wednesday that it was open to working with any domestic and foreign internet resource as long as it respects Russian law and its citizens.",

    "body": "Dutch payments giant Adyen's stock fell as much as 20% after it posted net revenue guidance and payment processing volume that were slightly weaker than expected.The company forecast net revenue growth of 20% to 22% for 2026, while analysts expected year-on-year growth at 22.8%, according to LSEG estimates.\"This outlook is underpinned by a strong pipeline and the continued ramp of our 2025 cohort, providing a solid foundation for the year ahead,\" Adyen said in its shareholder letter. \"We expect market volume growth to remain broadly in line with 2025 levels, reflecting continued macroeconomic uncertainty.\"Adyen processed 745.3 billion euros ($885.5 billion) in payments in the second half of the year, which came in below a 771-billion-euro revenue estimate from KBC Securities.\"Although results today and next year's outlook is largely ok, this might not be enough to turn around the very negative sentiment on the payment sector we have seen recently,\" KBC Securities said in a note on Thursday morning.The stock was down 16% as of 11.15 a.m. local time, and shares are down around 16% so far this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAdyen stock in the year-to-dateAdyen reported net revenue had increased 17% YoY on a reported basis, hitting 1.27 billion euros, with both EMEA and North America growing 17% each.Net revenue gains were \"moderated by slower growth\" from APAC-headquartered online retailers and a weaker U.S. dollar, the company said.Net revenue from APAC clients accelerated slightly to 14% growth, which Adyen reported was mostly driven by deepened relationships with existing customers.Net revenues for the second half were largely inline with analyst forecasts. Adyen has seen some big stock swings in recent years. Its share price fell 39% in August 2023, after reporting worse-than-expected sales and a profit drop in the first half of the year. ",

    "body": "Westminster, South Bank, London, England.Scott E Barbour | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesThe U.K. economy grew a meager 0.1% in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary figures from the Office for National Statistics on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters expected the economy to have grown 0.2% over the October-December period, following 0.1% growth in the third quarter.Month-on-month, the economy expanded 0.1% in December, down from a 0.2% expansion, revised down from 0.3%, the previous month. Pound sterling was flat against the dollar following the data, at $1.3624.The ONS' Director of Economic Statistics Liz McKeown said the latest data showed a mixed economic picture.\"The often-dominant services sector showed no growth, with the main driver instead coming from manufacturing. Construction, meanwhile, registered its worst performance in more than four years,\" she said on X Thursday.The U.K. economy is estimated to have grown 1.3% in 2025, the ONS noted, following growth of 1.1% in 2024.The growth figures come after the Bank of England voted narrowly at its early February meeting to keep interest rates on hold, at 3.75%, given persistent inflationary pressures. Those pressures are expected to ease in the coming months, however, and economists predict that the central bank could next cut rates in April to stimulate the lackluster British economy.Samuel Edwards, head of Client Portfolio Management at financial services firm Ebury, noted that the U.K. had ended 2025 on a positive note, \"albeit a very modest one.\"\"After a very turbulent week in UK politics and a wave of market jitters, businesses will be pleased to have a slither of positive economic news,\" he said.\"However, whilst the U.K. economy keeps its head above water, concerns remain around the slowing jobs market and sticky inflation,\" he remarked in emailed comments.Scott Gardner, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Personal Investing, commented Thursday that after a mixed bag in the final quarter, recent data hints that the U.K. economy is due a recovery in 2026.\"Manufacturing activity picked up in the first month of the year while the services industry has seen a decent influx of new business activity. The hope is that this progress can grease the wheels of the economy and lead to an improved outlook and performance over 2026.\"",

    "body": "Schroders soared to the top of the Stoxx 600 on Thursday, hitting a 52-week high, after U.S. fund management giant Nuveen said it would buy the U.K.'s largest standalone asset management.The deal, sized at £9.9 billion ($13.5 billion), will create one of the world's biggest asset management groups.Nuveen — the investment management arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA), a pensions and insurance group  — will acquire Schroders for up to 612 pence per share.The deal will create a global fund management behemoth with almost $2.5 trillion in assets under management, including $414 billion in combined private markets assets.Shares in London-listed Schroders were up over 28% in morning trade following the announcement.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSchroders PLC.Under the agreement, the Schroders brand will be maintained, with the company remaining headquartered in London. Established in 1804, Schroders currently manages about £824 billion in assets, almost two-thirds of which are in the EMEA region.Nuveen manages about $1.4 trillion in assets, 94% of which are in the Americas.The transaction will deliver \"an attractive premium in cash\" to shareholders, Elizabeth Corley, chair of Schroders, said in a statement.Group CEO Richard Oldfield added that the deal will \"significantly accelerate our growth plans to create a leading public-to-private platform with enhanced geographic reach and a strengthened balance sheet.\"\"This transaction is about unlocking new growth opportunities for wealth and institutional investors around the world by giving our leading, differentiated public-to-private platform a broader global presence,\" said Nuveen CEO William Huffman.End of an eraThe takeover signals the end of the Schroders family's control over the 220-year-old business — with the billionaire British-German banking dynasty having held a 44% stake — and comes amid a sharp turnaround in fortunes for the company, according to Panmure Liberum.\"Schroders was a mess,\" Rae Maile, analyst at Panmure Liberum, said in a note, highlighting rising costs and disclosure shortcomings. Schroders reported its second-half earnings on Thursday, which saw adjusted operating profits surge 25% in 2025 to £756.6 million, beating its £745 million guidance and Panmure's earlier £674 million forecast, while AUM increased by 6%.\"In just 15 months, this new management team had set out a plan to reinvigorate the business — it had cut costs, shed tangential businesses and re-established its links with its home equity market. To have achieved quite so much, quite so quickly is staggering, but still the market was not reflecting that in either estimates or rating,\" Maile added.",

    "body": "A McDonald's cheeseburger, fries and soda arranged in Celina, Texas, Sept. 2, 2025.Jake Dockins | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMcDonald's on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations as its value push wins back customers.\"By listening to customers and taking action, we have improved traffic and strengthened our value & affordability scores,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.12 adjusted vs. $3.05 expectedRevenue: $7 billion vs. $6.84 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.16 billion, or $3.03 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald's earned $3.12 per share.Net revenue climbed 10% to $7 billion.The company's same-store sales increased 5.7%, fueled by strong growth in its home market. Wall Street was projecting same-store sales growth of 3.9%, according to StreetAccount estimates.U.S. same-store sales increased 6.8%. In the year-ago period, its domestic same-store sales shrank 1.4% after an E. coli outbreak weeks into the quarter weighed on traffic. McDonald's credited buzzy promotions — like its Grinch Meal and Monopoly promotion — that boosted both traffic and sales this year. For nearly a week, McDonald's was the largest seller of socks in the world, thanks to the popularity of the Grinch Meal, which included the special-edition clothing item in many of its markets. Kempczinski said the company sold 50 million pairs globally in the first few days of the promotion. It was also the catalyst for McDonald's highest-ever sales day, according to Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. The chain also expanded its value offerings by relaunching Extra Value Meals, which offer a roughly 15% discount on combo meals.Outside the U.S., McDonald's saw same-store sales growth in nearly all markets. The company's international operated markets segment, which includes Germany and Australia, reported same-store sales growth of 5.2%. Its international developmental licensed markets division saw same-store sales rise 4.5%.Looking to 2026, McDonald's is \"off to a strong start,\" according to Borden. But executives expect weaker first-quarter same-store sales growth compared with the fourth quarter. While Extra Value Meals are drawing in diners, the winter storm that swept across the country in late January scared some away and caused temporary restaurant closures.For the full year, McDonald's is planning to spend between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion on capital expenditures, according to a regulatory filing. Most of that will be spent opening approximately 2,600 new locations. The addition of 2,100 net new restaurants is expected to raise systemwide sales about 2.5%, excluding currency fluctuations. McDonald's plans to open about 750 restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets, while licensees and affiliates will open more than 1,800 restaurants in other markets.\"We believe the underlying assumptions for our 2026 outlook are prudent and reflect our expectations that the [quick-service restaurant] industry environments in the U.S. and across many markets will remain challenging,\" Borden said. The chain also has big plans for its menu in 2026. Later this year, McDonald's will roll out new beverages, including energy drinks, fruity refreshers and crafted sodas in the U.S. and select international markets. The new drinks are the result of lessons learned from its now-shuttered CosMc's spinoff and a 500-restaurant test that took place last summer. Like Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, McDonald's is hoping that fun drinks will attract diners and lift sales.The chain has also been leaning into chicken, which is more popular with U.S. consumers than beef. Recently, several Chicago-area locations began testing hand-breaded chicken strips, wings and grilled sandwiches. Still, the experiment is still in the early stages, Global Chief Restaurant Experience Officer Jill McDonald said on the company's conference call.Longer term, McDonald's is also looking to add menu items that would interest diners who are using GLP-1 drugs, McDonald said. Plus, the chain will highlight the high protein content of its existing menu.\"We'll be led by the customers and what they what they want from us, but there's plenty [for] them to enjoy on our menu currently,\" she said.",

Stripping out currency fluctuations and sales from restaurants it plans to refranchise, Restaurant Brands' organic revenue ticked up 6.5%.The company's same-store sales increased 3.1%, fueled by strong international growth. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands' same-store sales climbed 6.1%. International Burger King restaurants, which represents the bulk of the segment, saw same-store sales growth of 5.8%. Analysts were projecting international same-store sales growth of just 3.7%, based on StreetAccount estimates.And Restaurant Brands plans to keep growing its business abroad. In November, the company announced its plan to form a joint venture for Burger King China to accelerate expansion. Under the terms of the deal, which closed in late January, CPE, a Chinese alternative asset manager, owns roughly 83% of Burger King China. Restaurant Brands has retained a minority stake of about 17%, along with a seat on the board of directors.Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons reported same-store sales growth of 2.9%, although Wall Street was projecting an increase of 3.8%, according to StreetAccount. Tim Hortons accounted for 46% of Restaurant Brands' overall revenue during the quarter.Burger King reported overall same-store sales growth of 2.7%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 2.4%.Popeyes was the laggard of Restaurant Brands' portfolio. Its same-store sales fell 4.8%, a steeper decline than the 2.4% decrease forecast by Wall Street. But the company has plans to revive the embattled fried chicken chain. In November, Restaurant Brands tapped Burger King veteran Peter Perdue to lead the chain's U.S. and Canadian business; last month, the company also named Popeyes veteran Matt Rubin as the chain's latest chief marketing officer.Restaurant Brands plans to share more of its ideas to grow the business at its investor day in Miami on Feb. 26.",

The company in its fourth-quarter earnings report in January projected AI-related capital expenditures to total in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion in 2026.\"We believe concerns around META's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI,\" stated the Pershing presentation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMETA 1-year chartPershing noted that Meta currently trades at a 22 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, cheap considering how much AI is set to rev up future earnings growth.

    "body": "The prospect of a U.S. attack on Iran has roiled oil prices this year, but analysts tell CNBC a strike would require more military commitment and be more complicated, than the U.S. is prepared for.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude April futuresTensions are high, and despite talks last week in Oman, both sides remain at an impasse. U.S. President Donald Trump's pressure on the Iranian regime escalated after a brutal crackdown on anti-government protestors across the country last month.Trump said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, even as Washington and Tehran prepare to resume talks. On Tuesday, he threatened Iran with \"something very tough,\" if it does not agree to Washington's demands, which range from halting the country's nuclear enrichment to cutting Tehran's ballistic missile program.The U.S. deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the Middle East in January. This brought the number of missile destroyers in the region to six, but, analysts say, this still wouldn't be enough to topple the regime. Following through on his \"something tough\" threat would mean a prolonged conflict in a region Trump is wary of.\"U.S. forces in the region are not adequate to support a significant long-term military operation in Iran which would be necessary to achieve any major military objective,\" Alireza Ahmadi, executive fellow at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, told CNBC.Trump has also dialed up his pressure on the Islamic Republic, applying financial pressure to an economy already crippled by sanctions. Just last month, he vowed to impose tariffs on any country that acquires any goods or services from Iran. But it is unclear what could come next. \"President Trump is notoriously unpredictable,\" Ali Vaez, director of Iran Project at Crisis Group, told CNBC but added Trump is aware \"the Iran problem set does not lend itself to clean and easy military options.\"Could the U.S. still attack Iran? Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told CNBC that \"the cost of not attacking Iran would be huge,\" adding, if he doesn't, \"Trump's legacy will be as the president who enabled Iran to go nuclear.\"\"The President is in a jam, his options are not great and it's a very risky moment at this point,\" Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, told CNBC's Dan Murphy last week. McNally added the country's ballistic missile program meant that \"we'd have to go big, because Iran is quite formidable.\"What are Trump's options?Trump said last week that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, should be \"very worried.\" But targeting Iran's leadership would not be an operation like the one that seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, analysts have warned.\"The Iranian government is not Venezuela,\" Alireza Ahmadi said, adding that if the U.S. removed Khamenei, \"a replacement would be chosen immediately and the military would effectively be running the country for the foreseeable future.\"Power in Iran is centralized around Khamenei. While there is a president, the Islamic Republic's political, military and foreign policy decisions are all made by him. Khamenei has held ultimate authority for the last three decades, aided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, which helps enforce the regime's policies and plays a major role in its foreign policy. If the U.S. were able to remove Khamenei and found a regime official to replace him with, there would still be an \"open question\" on what happens to the IRGC, Rubin told CNBC. Iranian worshippers hold portraits of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and a country flag during a protest to condemn Israeli attacks on Iran, after Friday prayers ceremonies in downtown Tehran, Iran, on June 13, 2025. Morteza Nikoubazl | Nurphoto | Getty Images\"The U.S. cannot change the regime through air power alone and without any boots (U.S. or Iranian) on the ground. It can only transform the regime into something else, which could be worse, or turn Iran into another failed state,\" Vaez told CNBC.Ahmadi said regime change in Iran \"would require at least an Iraq War level of military commitment, which Trump is unlikely to favor.\" Between 2003 and 2011, 4,500 American armed forces personnel were killed in Iraq.The White House claimed after strikes on three main nuclear sites last year that Iran's nuclear facilities were \"obliterated.\" Iran moved to quickly repair the damage to ballistic missile sites but according to analysis from the New York Times, has made \"limited fixes\" to the major nuclear sites hit by the United States. Iran has long claimed it does not have any plans to develop nuclear weapons. As talks restart between Washington and Tehran, Iran has offered to cap its enrichment at low levels. The U.S. has opposed the Iranians enriching any uranium since the nuclear deal collapsed in 2018. While the U.S. has vowed to attack Iran if it resumes its nuclear and missile programs, it is unclear whether these sites would again be primed for attack.  \"Both options are likely to lead to a disproportionate Iranian retaliation, which could then turn the confrontation into a regional conflagration,\" Vaez said. Potential Iranian retaliation Iran has vowed to retaliate against U.S. bases in the region if Washington strikes.\"Iran is betting that the U.S. does not have enough missile interceptors and THAAD systems to protect its sprawling military bases and facilities across the region, as well as Israel,\" Ahmadi told CNBC.The U.S. has around 40,000 military personnel in the Middle East. It has bases in the Arabian Gulf including the United States Naval Forces Central Command in Bahrain, Al Udeid air base in Qatar, which Iran hit last summer and Al Dhafra air base just south of Abu Dhabi.In this frame-grab made from video, missiles and air-defense interceptors illuminate the night sky over Doha after Iran launched an attack on US forces at Al Udeid Air Base on June 23, 2025 in Doha, Qatar. Getty Images\"Iran will undoubtedly target U.S. bases in Iraq, Syria, the Gulf, and its naval assets. It is also likely to target Israel. The remnants of its proxies could also join in,\" Vaez told CNBC. Iran seems \"to be preparing for a week, if not months, long military confrontation. There seems to be a sense among Iranian leadership that the U.S. is overestimating its leverage and that a significant war may be necessary to correct those assumptions,\" Ahmadi added. ",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica's more than tripled its Meta artificial intelligence glasses sales last year, the Ray-Ban maker said on Wednesday in its fourth-quarter results. The French-Italian eyewear brand said it sold over 7 million AI glasses last year.That's up from the 2 million that the company sold in 2023 and 2024 combined, according to its quarterly report last February. The figure reported Wednesday includes smart glasses sold under the brands for Ray-Ban and Oakley, the latter of which was unveiled in June. The company's smart glasses success is the latest sign that the adoption of wearable AI devices is gaining momentum with consumers. \"Our success in wearables is helping to propel the AI-glasses revolution, with our iconic brands being a powerful driver of demand,\" the company said in a release.EssilorLuxottica has been working on the wearable devices with the social media company since 2019, CNBC reported at the time. The two companies launched the first edition of the glasses in September 2021, but the device didn't gain widespread attention until the second-generation launch in 2023. In September, EssilorLuxottica and Meta introduced a new Ray-Ban iteration, controllable through hand gestures and neural technology. That device retails for $799 and features a small display in one of the lenses. Meta in January said it would pushback the international launch of the Ray-Ban Display glasses, originally slated for early 2026, due to \"unprecedented\" demand in the U.S.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Meta and EssilorLuxottica were discussing doubling production to at least 20 million by the end of this year to meet growing demand. Meta has indicated its commitment to working with the glasses maker and extended a long-term partnership agreement to \"collaborate into the next decade\" in 2024.WATCH: New Mexico AG Raul Torrez: Meta has created a space for predators to target and exploit childrenwatch now",

The result was significantly lower than analyst expectations of 6.6 billion euros. Mercedes-Benz Group said its earnings were shaped by foreign exchange headwinds and competition in China, alongside a reported 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) hit in tariff costs.\"Amid a dynamic market environment, our financial results remained within our guidance, thanks to our sharp focus on efficiency, speed, and flexibility,\" Ola Källenius, chairman of the board of management at Mercedes-Benz Group, said in a statement.The results come as European car giants face a multitude of challenges, from rising production costs and supply chain disruptions to regulatory pressures and a bumpy electric vehicle transition. Shares of the Munich-listed company were off around 2% during morning deals, paring some of its earlier losses. The stock is down roughly 7% so far this year. watch nowLooking ahead, Mercedes-Benz Group said it planned further cost cuts in 2026 as well as a flurry of product launches, targeting an adjusted return on sales for Mercedes-Benz Cars of 3% to 5%, down from the 5% growth it reported in 2025.The company also said it expects revenues to come in at the prior-year level, after reporting revenues of 132.2 billion euros in 2025, while group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is expected to be \"significantly above\" the previous year's level.

Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $1.04 adjusted vs. $1.02 expected Revenue: $15.35 billion vs. $15.12 billion expectedCisco's revenue grew about 10% from $14 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income increased to $3.18 billion, or 80 cents per share, from $2.43 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The adjusted figure excludes stock-based compensation costs.For the current period, Cisco expects $1.02 to $1.04 in adjusted earnings per share and $15.4 billion to $15.6 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $1.03 per share and $15.18 billion in revenue.Investors have been looking for Cisco to play a more central role in the artificial intelligence boom, which has lifted chipmakers and providers of other data center technologies. Cisco is seeing some growth acceleration, reporting $2.1 billion in AI infrastructure orders from hyperscalers during the quarter.Cisco's core networking revenue increased 21% from a year earlier to $8.3 billion. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $7.9 billion.  During the quarter, Cisco said it would provide products for an AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia alongside Advanced Micro Devices. Cisco also announced the launch of a networking switch that contains an Nvidia chip.\"On the sovereign side, there's really no real need nor expectation for meaningful impact in FY26,\" Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said on a conference call with analysts. \"And so we don't need that to actually accelerate for the guide that we've, that we've provided. It's purely upside.\" The ramping up of revenue from neoclouds, which are cloud providers that are younger than mature entities such as Amazon and Microsoft, should start in the second half of the current fiscal year and become more pronounced in the 2027 fiscal year, Robbins said. The rising price of memory because of sharp demand for Nvidia graphics processing units has been affecting a variety of equipment companies. Cisco has announced price hikes and is adjusting contracts with channel partners, Robbins said.\"Do I think customers will try to buy ahead in some cases? Perhaps,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's going to be a big trend in the networking side of our business.\"For the 2026 fiscal year, Cisco is targeting $4.13 to $4.17 in adjusted earnings per share and $61.2 billion to $61.7 billion in revenue, which implies 8.5% growth.

He did not say which employees may have been cut as a result of the restructuring or which employees may have resigned of their own volition.\"We are hiring aggressively,\" Musk added. Earlier this week, xAI co-founders Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu announced their exits after several other founding members, including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy and Greg Yang, previously departed.Last week, Musk announced a record-setting, all-stock transaction in which SpaceX, the aerospace and defense juggernaut, acquired xAI, which owns and operates social network X and is the developer of Grok, the embattled AI chatbot and image generator. The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post merger, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The co-founder departures and the reorganization this week come as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year and while xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S.The probes are looking into whether xAI violated regional regulations after Grok enabled mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google.

Demand typically comes from large institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers seeking to match long-term liabilities.Alphabet joins a small group of sterling-denominated century bond issuers, including the University of Oxford, the Wellcome Trust, EDF Energy and the government of Mexico.The 100-year bond attracted almost 10 times orders for the £1 billion ($1.37 billion) sale on Tuesday, with the coupon reaching 120 basis points above 10-year gilts, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cites anonymous sources.'Off-the-historical scale'Bill Blain, CEO of Wind Shift Capital, said the deal is reflective of the \"off-the-historical scale\" levels of debt now being raised in both public and private markets to finance AI expansion. Alphabet said last week that its capex spend is expected to hit $185 billion this year.\"I give them full credit for taking advantage of the opportunity that existed to sell a moderately high coupon 100-year bond,\" Blain told CNBC in an interview. \"They clearly identified demand… that this was what U.K. insurance and pension funds wanted to cover their liabilities.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet.But with credit spreads at historically tight levels, long-term data center demand uncertain, and rapid technological change set to create winners and losers in the sector, Blain said the deal offers further proof of market froth around AI.\"Firms that have spotted the opportunity and been able to fill it — they've spotted the opportunity because there is froth there that's getting people excited about being involved in that,\" he said.\"I think the fact that a 100-year bond comes out, you can't get much more frothy than that. If you're looking for a signal of a top — even if it's a brilliantly-executed deal — it does look a bit like a signal of a top, absolutely.\"As rivals including Oracle, Amazon and Microsoft also scale up infrastructure spending — with tech giants' total debt issuance predicted to reach some $3 trillion over five years — strategists say the century bond also broadens Alphabet's lender base.\"It's interesting that Alphabet is lining up this GBP issuance at the very long end of the market to fund their AI capex,\" said Nachu Chockalingam, head of London credit at Federated Hermes. \"They are looking to tap into insurance and pension demand, and diversity funding sources to avoid over-saturating the USD market.\"watch nowTatjana Greil Castro, co-head of public markets at Muzinich & Co., said the issuance is a bet by investors that Alphabet can continue to reinvent itself over the next 100 years and beyond.She told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday: \"You do take a leap into that company being around to pay interest over the next 100 years. It is very rare... even governments don't really issue 100-year debt.\"'Untested waters'Simon Prior, fund manager for fixed income funds at Premier Miton, said pension funds would welcome the name diversification offered by a highly-rated issuer like Alphabet at that part of the curve, in contrast with EDF and the Mexican government.\"The fact that they are bringing sterling issuance doesn't indicate ongoing investment in the U.K. specifically, but offers more a diversification of their funding, having tapped the dollar market the day before and concurrently issuing in Swiss Francs,\" Prior told CNBC via email.\"I would expect them to hedge it back to their local currency rather than leave their liability with only a small proportion of their revenues and profits coming from [the U.K.].\"Still, Prior cautioned that 100-year issuance remains relatively \"untested waters.\"\"Buyers will be locking in just over 6% yields in a turbulent global and local political environment, when tech companies are trading at all-time highs in equities despite the ever-evolving nature of the industry,\" he said.Blain added: \"The whole point about the sheer scale of the AI hyperscaler debt-fest reminds me so much of so many situations I've seen in the past, especially around a market that gets a theme, and then follows it to the extreme, without really getting what it is they're buying.\"He also drew a sharp contrast between corporate and sovereign debt, noting that while sovereign debt is typically less likely to default, owing to governments' ability to print money, corporate borrowers by contrast are subject to similar forces as the equity market, such as missed targets and changes in technology.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday passed a resolution disapproving of President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada, a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rare Republican rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.The resolution cleared the House 219-211, with several Republicans crossing the aisle to support it. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the measure.The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., was considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.Trump warned Republicans during the vote that there would be consequences for overriding him on tariffs. \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump posted to his TRUTH social account during the vote. \"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.\"The risk was worth it for some Republicans, especially those in swing districts where tariffs are deeply unpopular. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is retiring at the end of his term and voted for the anti-tariff resolution, told reporters earlier in the day that the White House tried and failed to flip his vote. \"I voted on principle,\" Bacon said of a Tuesday procedural vote that allowed the measure to proceed. \"They were trying to do sweeteners for Nebraska, but I said what about the other 49 states?\" The Democratic side of the House chamber erupted in cheers when the resolution passed.

Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump,\" Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them.\"The measure now heads to the Senate, which approved similar resolutions last year. \"Congress has spoken with bipartisan clarity: it's time to give Americans relief and end Trump's tariff tax,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This price-spiking tariff tax is raising costs on everything from groceries prices to energy bills — all because Trump chose chaos over common sense. It's time to deliver relief.\"The vote on Trump's tariffs forced House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.\"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,\" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approves Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.\"This is life with a razor-thin majority,\" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. \"I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.\"",

    "body": "Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testifies at a U.S. Senate hearing in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 8, 2021.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesInstagram chief Adam Mosseri said Wednesday during testimony in a high-profile social media trial that he thinks there can be problematic usage of social media, but does not think it constitutes an addiction.\"I'm sure I said this, but I think it's important to differentiate between clinical addiction and problematic use,\" said Mosseri, who noted several times that he is not a medical professional.Mosseri said that sometimes the use of the word addiction can refer to something more casually, and  noted that while he may have once said he was addicted to a Netflix show, that's not an actual clinical addiction. \"So it's a personal thing, but yeah, I do think it's possible to use Instagram more than you feel good about,\" Mosseri said. \"Too much is relative, it's personal.\"Mosseri testified in Los Angeles Superior Court, where the plaintiff alleges that social media platforms Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap misled the public about the safety of their apps while knowing certain design choices and features fostered detrimental mental health effects in young users.Although TikTok and Snap were originally part of the case, the two companies are no longer involved after settling with a plaintiff involved in the lawsuit.Plaintiff attorney Mark Lanier questions Adam Mosseri, the head of Meta Platforms' Instagram, as part of a trial on what plaintiffs call \"social media addiction\" in children and young adults, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. Feb. 11, 2026 in a courtroom sketch.   Mona Edwards | Reuters\"The question for the jury in Los Angeles is whether Instagram was a substantial factor in the plaintiff's mental health struggles,\" a Meta spokesperson said.The LA trial centers around a plaintiff listed as \"KGM\" and her mother, who allege that the tech companies designed features like infinite scroll that resulted in addictive behavior and negative mental health issues.\"The evidence will show she faced many significant, difficult challenges well before she ever used social media,\" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement.Mark Lanier, the plaintiff's lawyer, questioned Mosseri about social media addiction and about certain choices that company executives made that resulted in alleged negative harm.When Lanier asked Mosseri whether there's such a thing as problematic usage of Instagram, Mosseri replied, \"I think it depends on the person.\"Lanier pressed Mosseri about his role as a \"decision maker\" for Instagram, and if he leans toward making decisions that lead to profit before testing, or if he emphasizes testing products first to protect children.\"In general, we should be focused on the protection of minors, but I believe protecting minors over the long run is good for business and for profit,\" Mosseri said.The trial, which had opening statements Monday, is one of multiple legal cases this year that center on the safety of social media platforms and what the companies knew about potential dangers to children.Plastic surgery digital filtersLanier introduced an exhibit detailing a November 2019 email exchange between company executives debating whether to ban digital filters that can alter photos of people's faces to appear as if they had plastic surgery.Mosseri said that the company ultimately decided to not allow any digital effects that would encourage plastic surgery after debating what could be permissible given the advanced capabilities of modern-day makeup.In the email chain, in which one subhead included the phrase \"PR fire on plastic surgery,\" Meta executives discussed concerns from the press and health experts on whether the digital filtering effects could lead to detrimental mental health issues.Meta tech chief Andrew Bosworth said in the email chain that he notified CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the plastic surgery digital filter, and that the Facebook co-founder \"might want to review before implementing.\"\"He is concerned about whether we have good enough data that this represents real harm,\" Bosworth said of Zuckerberg's view on the project.watch nowFormer Meta executive John Hegeman said in another email related to the chain that \"a blanket ban on things that can't be done with make-up is going to limit our ability to be competitive in Asian markets (including India).\" \"I'd much rather see us develop a nuanced framework for responsible use that still allows us to build the products that people clearly want and intentionally seek out,\" Hegeman wrote in the email.Mosseri said Wednesday that while he interpreted Hegeman's comments to mean that a blanket ban of the proposed filters would hurt the company's ability to compete in Asian markets, he didn't think that the former Meta executive was talking about money, but rather cultural relevance.He said that Meta doesn't make money from its filters and instead wants to be culturally relevant so people can enjoy the platform.Lanier then presented an email exchange between Mosseri and Meta policy executive Andy O'Connell in which the Instagram head was asked to pick one of three options before going to Zuckerberg for his executive decision on the filters.The first option included a temporary ban on plastic surgery filters under the current policy, and then a re-evaluation when there is more definitive data on wellbeing. The option listed \"pros\" of mitigating well-being concerns and leading to no PR or regulatory risks, but it had the \"cons\" of limiting growth. The second option would lift the ban on the plastic surgery filters while removing the effects from being recommended to Instagram users. The \"cons\" of that option included a still notable risk to well-being.The third option was a lift on the ban, which would have the lowest impact to growth but the highest risk to well-being and the possibility of generating bad media attention.Mosseri replied to the email that he preferred option 2, which Lanier noted was the choice that involved a notable risk to well-being.\"I respect your call on this and I'll support it, but want it to just say for the record that i don't think its the right call given the risks,\" wrote Margaret Stewart, the vice president of product design and responsible innovation at Facebook, in a reply to Mosseri. Stewart supported banning the filters.Mosseri told the courtroom repeatedly that the company ended up with a more \"focused ban\" that involved a subset of digital filters.During cross-examination, Mosseri further explained that digital filters are for a minority of users who want to make posts more fun and entertaining, but that the company doesn't make any money from the technology.\"We want to help people express themselves. But when it comes to revenue, that's based on how many ads people see on Instagram,\" Mosseri said. \"I haven't seen any data that suggests using filters drives content consumption or ads. It's not a revenue decision.\"WATCH: New Mexico AG Raul Torrez on Meta trial.Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

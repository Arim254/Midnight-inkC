    "body": "Steve Sonnenberg credits his entrepreneurial \"superpower\" with helping him turn a side hustle into a company that's now valued at $1 billion, he says.The key to his success, he says: He's not fazed by the risk of launching a new venture, or by the inevitable setbacks that follow. \"When it comes to entrepreneurship, my superpower is all about just beginning. It's very easy for me to start, because that's just who I am,\" says Sonnenberg, 44, the co-founder and CEO of employee rewards platform Awardco. And when he experiences obstacles with his business, \"I just pivot really fast, because I know it's going to work,\" Sonnenberg says. \"You just have to have that level of confidence.\"Founded in 2011, Awardco was most recently valued at $1 billion following a $165 million funding round in May. Clients like AT&T and Hertz use its platform, which gives employees reward points they can redeem for millions of items on Amazon Business' marketplace.Sonnenberg started working on Awardco after his previous company WholesaleMatch, which he'd started in college, was named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit primarily concerned one of WholesaleMatch's clients, and Sonnenberg's assets were frozen during the legal proceedings. He filed for bankruptcy, shuttered his business and \"had nothing left\" to support his family with four young kids, he says.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at workYet he already knew his next step, he says: Start building his next company, even though he didn't have a fully-formed idea for it yet. He put $5,000 he didn't have on a credit card to buy the Awardco.com domain from its previous owner, he says. \"What does any crazy entrepreneur do? You always have another [idea] on deck,\" says Sonnenberg.As he turned to other jobs to make money — first as a freelance web designer, then working for business software company Qualtrics — Sonnenberg built Awardco on the side with his cousin Mike Sonnenberg and Qualtrics colleague Tanner Runia. His idea shifted from a physical store selling trophies to wholesale rewards for corporations before landing on Awardco's current business model, he says.Amazon initially balked at partnering with the then-unknown platform, says Sonneberg. The rejection could've pushed him to give up or move onto a different idea. Instead, Sonnenberg made cold calls to sign corporate clients up anyway, and when employees placed orders on Awardco's platform, his wife manually ordered the corresponding products on Amazon for them, he says.In 2015, Amazon invited Awardco to partner with its Amazon Business marketplace, automating the ordering process, Sonnenberg says.\"Start, [then] pivot, pivot, pivot, pivot: That's the story of Awardco, with my back against the wall,\" says Sonnenberg.Successful entrepreneurs 'don't get in the way of themselves'Building something successful after suffering a major failure typically takes resilience and confidence. \"I just keep going. I don't know what it is, but anything I've ever done, it's been successful, but it's failed [first]. It's the consistency of keeping it on the track,\" Sonnenberg says.Entrepreneurs frequently discuss the importance of simply taking the jump to start a new venture — anticipating that you'll need to weather any initial setbacks, and learn from those failures to increase your chances of future success.\"Entrepreneurship is really hard. There's no instant success ... You just have to be ready to fail,\" Dayu Dara Permata, the co-founder and CEO of Indonesian property transaction platform Pinhome, told CNBC Make It in May. \"Fail fast, learn fast.\"Of course, you shouldn't try to fail simply for the sake of failing, according to Harvard Business School professor of leadership Amy C. Edmondson. Thoroughly research each new opportunity to minimize risk and ensure that any failure is an \"intelligent failure,\" Edmondson recommended in December 2023.Sonnenberg had a leg up on his Awardco research, he says: His father made awards and plaques for large organizations like McDonald's. \"I just knew the space. I knew that this industry is old school [and] ripe for disruption. I was 100% confident that we were going to find success,\" he says.His confidence is partially a result of being \"a bit [of] a naive entrepreneur,\" he adds. \"And I think that's a trait of successful entrepreneurs: They don't get in the way of themselves.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "The cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people has declined for the third straight year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.The \"classic\" meal — a 16-pound turkey and sides like stuffing, rolls, sweet potatoes, peas, cranberries and pumpkin pie ingredients — costs an average of $55.18 nationwide, new data from AFBF finds. The estimates come from the farm advocacy group's annual price survey, conducted in the first week of November and based on volunteer shoppers in all 50 states checking grocery store prices for the same Thanksgiving staples each year.The biggest cost is the turkey at an average of $21.50. Other items include 30-ounce pumpkin pie mix at an average cost of $4.16, three pounds of sweet potatoes at $4, one gallon of whole milk at $3.73 and 14 ounces of stuffing mix at $3.71, according to the data.Prices also vary by region, with the classic meal averaging a high of $61.75 in the West and a low of $50.01 in the South.The cost of the classic dinner is down 5% from 2024 and well below the record high of $64.05 reached in 2022. But it's still higher than its 2020 level, when the same meal averaged $46.90. However, with inflation factored in, 2025's price is roughly in line with what the 2020 dinner would cost today.Here's a look at the average price for the last 10 years, according to AFBF's annual survey. Figures are not adjusted for inflation.2015: $50.112016: $49.872017: $49.122018: $48.902019: $48.912020: $46.902021: $53.312022: $64.052023: $61.17 2024: $58.08 Retailers may help keep turkey prices downAt an average price of $21.50, turkey makes up nearly half the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner, according to AFBF data. But even though wholesale turkey prices are up about 75% from last year due to avian flu and higher production costs, shoppers aren't necessarily seeing that increase at the register, according to researchers at Purdue University.That's because grocers often mark down whole frozen turkeys in November, treating the bird as a \"loss leader\" to draw customers into stores for other, higher-margin items, reports industry trade publication Grocery Dive.And those discounts can be steep. Purdue's analysis shows retailers are selling birds well below typical seasonal prices. Walmart, for example, is offering whole turkeys for $0.98 per pound, less than half of Purdue's estimated average retail price for November.Prices for sides are more mixed. Wheat-based items like dinner rolls and stuffing are cheaper, on average, in 2025, while fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes rose sharply due to weather issues and regional supply disruptions, according to AFBF.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOdds of a December rate cut remained low following the release of delayed jobs data. Markets were last pricing about a 35% chance of a quarter-point cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.The target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.   Those expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. However, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it's been since October 2021. \"All those numbers suggest an economy that's still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other,\" Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don't think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other.\" To be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight. \"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate,\" wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Weak hard data and close-to-target inflation look set to drive policy going forward, despite recent hawkish noises.\" \"The setup is in place for Powell to continue his risk-management approach to the labor market before his term as Chair expires in May,\" Haigh continued.

    "body": "Sale signs inside the Bath and Body Works store in Edmonton. On Thursday, January 6, 2022, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Artur Widak | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works Inc. stock plunged Thursday after the company reported \"disappointing\" third-quarter earnings and slashed its full-year outlook, citing \"macro consumer pressures.\"Shares sank nearly 25% on Thursday and hit a new 52-week low. The stock has plunged more than 50% this year.CEO Daniel Heaf announced a turnaround plan for the company, with expectations of $250 million in cost savings by 2027, aimed at attracting younger consumers and recentering the company's focus to its core products.\"Our third quarter results were below expectations, and we are lowering our outlook for the remainder of the year reflecting current business trends and continuation of recent macro consumer pressures,\" Heaf said in a statement. \"While this is disappointing, we are acting swiftly and decisively to position the business for sustainable, long-term growth.\"Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 35 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expectedRevenue: $1.59 billion vs. $1.63 billion expectedBath & Body reported net income of $77 million, or 37 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 1 compared with $106 million, or 49 cents a share, last year. Adjusting for one-time items including pretax gains, the company reported earnings of 35 cents a share.The company also slashed its yearly guidance due to \"current business trends.\" It also expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down in the high single digits compared with Wall Street estimates of an increase of 1.5%. The guidance, pulling on \"recent negative macro consumer sentiment\" and tariff impacts, also revised net sales guidance for the full year to low single digits.Heaf said the company is reorienting its strategy to focus once again on core products like body care, fragrances and soaps. The plan, called the \"Consumer First Formula,\" includes four strategic priorities: creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting the brand, winning in the marketplace and operating with speed and efficiency.The company had previously toyed with introducing other products like laundry detergent and shampoo, but Heaf said on a call with analysts Thursday that its efforts have not delivered promising results or attracted younger consumers.Heaf said the company will be exiting certain categories like haircare and men's grooming as it refocuses its priorities.\"Over the years, consumers have evolved. They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, emotive storytelling and elevated multi-channel experiences,\" Heaf said. \"Our competitors have risen to meet those needs. We have not.\"Heaf said on the call that the company is also recruiting influencers to \"ignite social buzz\" around the company's products in an attempt to garner attention from new consumers. Bath & Body Works also plans to revamp its app and website to increase engagement and aid in product discovery. The company will also lower its free shipping threshold in early 2026.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hand with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as they meet to negotiate for an end to the war in Ukraine, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersUkraine could face some tough choices amid reports that the U.S. and Russia have secretly formulated a peace plan to end the war, potentially including significant concessions to Moscow.Senior U.S. military officials are in Ukraine on Thursday \"on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, a U.S. army spokesman said.The visit comes a day after media reports suggested Washington and Moscow had held secret talks and devised a new 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, without Kyiv's involvement.The 28-point plan — first reported by Axios but followed by other media, including the Financial Times and Reuters, citing unnamed sources — allegedly contains proposals for Ukraine to concede territory in its eastern Donbas region to Russia, abandon certain categories of weaponry and reduce the size of its armed forces by 50%, among other conditions. One report in The Telegraph newspaper suggested that Russia could take control of the Donbas region despite Ukraine maintaining legal ownership, with Moscow essentially paying rent for the land. CNBC was unable to confirm the information contained within the media reports.A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that Kyiv had received \"signals\" about a set of U.S. proposals to end the war, but that Kyiv had had no role in preparing the proposals, the unnamed source said.The Kremlin on Wednesday denied that there had been any \"innovations on possible peace proposals\" since Russian President Vladimir Putin had met U.S. President Donald Trump in August. When asked specifically about the Axios report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was nothing he could share publicly.Meanwhile, the White House has not explicitly confirmed the existence of the 28-point peace plan, reportedly modeled on the Gaza peace agreement, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that new proposals were in the works.\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Rubio posted on X overnight Wednesday. \"Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict,\" he said.Ukraine in a corner?Ukraine leadership has not publicly commented on the 28-point plan, but peace proposals are expected to form part of Thursday's talks between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. delegation of military officials.On Wednesday, Zelenskyy commented that \"only President Trump and the United States have sufficient power to make this war come to an end.\"He said Kyiv had \"supported every decisive step and the leadership of [President Trump], every strong and fair proposal aimed at ending this war,\" and added that Ukraine was \"ready to work in any other meaningful formats that could yield results.\"Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia addressed reports of the peace plan head-on, however, suggesting in a post on X that Moscow was behind a push to hype up \"a factory of unrealistic plans.\"Whether Ukraine would accept such concessions to end the war is highly uncertain, with pushback likely. However, Kyiv finds itself in a vulnerable position given its reliance on the U.S. for military aid, and although it still has staunch support from its European allies, military and financial aid are slower to materialize now than in the early days of the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the Oval Office of the White House, amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersStill, European diplomats appear unhappy at the reports of a peace plan lacking Ukrainian or regional involvement, with the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas commenting Thursday that \"for any plan to work, it needs to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"\"In this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. So far, we haven't heard of any concessions from Russia's side,\" she told reporters.Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said that if the reports are true, the 28-peace plan would amount to \"Ukraine's full capitulation and would set conditions for renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine.\"\"The reported proposed peace plan would deprive Ukraine of critical defensive positions and capabilities necessary to defend against future Russian aggression, apparently in exchange for nothing,\" the ISW analysts said Wednesday. They noted it would \"give this significant land to Russia — apparently for no specified compromise — sparing Russia the time, effort, and manpower that it could use elsewhere in Ukraine during renewed aggression.\" The ISW concluded that the plan, if verified, showed Russia's maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine had essentially not changed since the initial invasion in 2022. \"This reported peace plan is fundamentally the same as Russia's 2022 Istanbul demands, which Russia presented to Ukraine when the circumstances on the battlefield appeared to favor Russia more heavily.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on artificial intelligence at the \"Winning the AI Race\" Summit in Washington D.C., U.S., July 23, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersAn executive order that could soon be signed by President Donald Trump would thwart states' artificial intelligence laws by launching legal challenges and withholding federal funding, according to a draft of the order obtained by CNBC on Wednesday.The draft surfaced shortly after Trump publicly called for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"The draft order would give Attorney General Pam Bondi 30 days to establish an \"AI Litigation Task Force\" whose sole task is to challenge state AI laws.Those challenges would be issued \"on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General's judgment,\" the draft says.The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to notify states with contested AI laws that they are ineligible for funds under the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. BEAD is a more than $42 billion program that has allocated funding to all U.S. states and territories.The order, which was first reported by The Information, is not yet finalized. A White House official told CNBC that any discussion around it is just speculation until it is officially announced.As written, the EO would be a major win for the burgeoning AI industry, whose leaders — including Sam Altman's OpenAI, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and other Silicon Valley titans — oppose an inconsistent state-by-state policy approach.It would be just as big a blow to state lawmakers across the country who have sought to pass bills that would place guardrails on the nascent technology.New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, who co-sponsored a state AI safety bill, in a statement to CNBC called the draft EO \"a blank check to Donald Trump's tech billionaire backers who've already made a fortune on — and now stand to profit exponentially more from — allowing unconstrained AI to wipe out jobs, destroy our kids' brains, and drive electricity bills through the roof.\"Bores, a Democrat who is running for Congress, this week became the first target of a well-funded super PAC backed by AI industry leaders.GOP mulls AI moratorium The White House is also working with a group of Republican lawmakers to see if a moratorium on certain state AI laws could be included in one of the major must-pass bills that Congress is working on. That language is still being drafted, but it would likely block states' abilities to regulate on issues like how AI is developed, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. States would likely still be able to craft policy on other AI-related matters such as fraud, consumer protections and images depicting the sexual abuse of children, the sources said.A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill,\" but cut out before Trump signed it in July.The current draft proposal could have no expiration date, including to one source familiar with the discussions. \"You're seeing China move very aggressively,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"AI is the wave of the future, but we want America to be dominant in it and we want our policies to reflect that.\"There is bipartisan support for new federal AI policy — even from those supporting state-level action.\"Let's be clear: we need a federal solution. But we need one that's crafted by experts and doesn't sell you out to the highest bidder. Until then, states must act,\" Bores said in an X post Thursday.But there is also bipartisan opposition to boxing out the states.\"There should not be a moratorium on states rights for AI,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., wrote on X. \"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also shot down the idea of a state-level AI moratorium. \"That provision doesn't appear to have a lot of support amongst Democrats and Republicans in the Congress,\" he told CNBC in a brief hallway interview. \"So I don't know why Donald Trump is bringing it back up at this time.\"Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday morning that he is open to a single national pre-emption.  but it would be a mistake to block states for acting until one is ready. \"If we take away the pressure from the states, Congress will never act,\" Warner said. \"Let's look at the fact we never did anything on social media. If we make that same response on AI and don't put guardrails, I think we'll come [to] rue it.\"— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesGoogle on Thursday rolled out Nano Banana Pro, its latest image editing and generation tool, continuing the company's momentum after launching its new Gemini artificial intelligence model earlier this week.The product is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced on Tuesday and contributed to record-breaking stock highs.Alphabet's stock was up 4% Thursday.Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that the Nano Banana Pro's capabilities expand beyond its original iteration, which launched in late August. \"It's incredible at infographics. It can make slide decks. It can take up to 14 different images, or five different characters, and sort of keep that character consistency,\" he said.He added that internal users have experimented with the feature by inputting code snippets and even LinkedIn resumes to create infographics.\"I think this ability to visualize things that were previously maybe not something you would think of as a visual medium that tends to be one of the magic things people are finding with it,\" Woodward said. The original Nano Banana went viral on social media as users turned photos of themselves or their pets into hyperrealistic 3D figurines. Woodward wrote in an X post in September that the product helped add 13 million new users to the Gemini app in the span of four days.Nano Banana Pro is currently available in the Gemini app, with limited free quotas, Google's writing assistant, NotebookLM, as well as the company's developer, enterprise and advertising products. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will have access to the product in Google's search features AI Mode.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia earnings takeaways: Bubble talk, 'half a trillion' forecast and China ordersNvidia says there's 'no assurance' of final agreement with OpenAI despite $100 billion pactMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to create his own startupBlock's stock pops 9% on gross profit forecast, 3-year financial outlookThe feature will later also roll out to Ultra subscribers first in Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool.Google introduced another feature in the Gemini app that allows users to upload any image to find out if it was generated by Google AI. Images generated on free Nano Banana accounts will have a watermark, but it will be removed for Google AI Ultra tier subscribers.Google has been working to gain ground on OpenAI in the generative AI race, which ignited after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Last week, OpenAI announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \" more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. ChatGPT currently tops the list of free apps on Apple's App Store, with Gemini in the second spot.The Gemini app currently has over 650 million monthly active users per month, and Gemini-powered AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said in a release. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in October that ChatGPT had reached 800 million weekly active users.Woodward said Google AI products have had growing demand, with many users signing up for Gemini's subscription plan to have \"higher limits with some of these advanced models.\"\"We're seeing high numbers of people coming to lots of these products,\" he said. \"That's really the best problem to have, is there's a lot of demand, and we're trying to figure out actually how to serve it.\"The company is looking to continue scaling its AI offerings, Woodward said, highlighting Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool, and Genie, a \"world building\" model that is currently available as a limited research preview.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle.The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is \"barely restrictive, if at all\" when it comes to the economic impact. Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices.\"I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective,\" she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place.\"Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is \"right around a neutral rate,\" indicating it does not need to come down much further.As a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year, Hammack serves as a key policy voice. The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members.While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet.\"What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them,\" she said. \"We are in this slow,  this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $5, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them.\"Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture \"mixed\" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate. watch now",

Daniel Cole | ReutersAlphabet's Waymo on Thursday announced that it will soon begin manually driving its robotaxi vehicles in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The Google sister company will start operating test drives in that trio of towns with human drivers in hopes of launching its driverless robotaxi service there as soon as next year, the company said. If Waymo does begin operating in those markets next year, that would bring the robotaxi company's list of 2026 planned expansions to 15 cities. On Tuesday, Waymo said it plans to start operating its vehicles with no human driver in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Miami and Orlando in the coming weeks, with plans to open service to the public there next year. The company has also previously announced plans to expand to Detroit, Denver, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and London in 2026.A spokesperson said Waymo will wait until its technology is validated in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans before committing to 2026 service launches.\"2026 is very much on the table, but we'll be led by our safety framework,\" Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in an email. With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company has provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020. Last week, Waymo began offering freeway routes in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets. The company said it will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.The addition of freeway rides marked an important milestone for Waymo and the robotaxi industry due to the challenges conditions of operating at such high speeds. Next year, Waymo will set its sights on achieving another key milestone: operating in markets known for harsh winter conditions.Along with Denver and Detroit, the addition of Minneapolis means Waymo believes its nearly ready to begin serving riders in regions where its driverless vehicles would need to be ready to brave snow and frigid forecasts. \"We currently operate at freezing temperatures, including with frost and hail, and we're validating our system to navigate harsher weather conditions,\" Teicher said. \"We'll have small fleets to start that we expand over time.\"This week, Amazon-owned Zoox began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles. San Francisco is the second market where Zoox now offers a free service, after its launch in Las Vegas in September. The company plans to remove its rider waitlist for San Francisco entirely in 2026.WATCH: Waymo launches paid robotaxi rides on freewayswatch now",

The cybersecurity provider is also in the process of buying Israeli identity security firm CyberArk for $25 billion under CEO Nikesh Arora's acquisition spree.He told investors in an earnings call that Palo Alto is making this simultaneous acquisition to address the fast-moving AI cycle.\"This large surge towards building AI compute is causing a lot of the AI players to think about newer models for software stacks and infrastructure stacks in the future,\" he said. Palo Alto guided for revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.59 billion in the second quarter, the midpoint of which was in line with a $2.58 billion estimate. For the full year, the company expects $10.50 billion to $10.54 billion, versus a $10.51 billion estimate. Capital expenditures during the period were much higher than expectations at $84 million.

    "body": "watch nowImprovement in mortgage rates at the end of the summer boosted home sales, but that gain may be short-lived.Sales of previously owned homes in October rose 1.2% from September to 4.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were up 1.7% year over year. This count is based on home closings, so contracts likely signed in August and September. While contract signings would not be impacted by the government shutdown that started in October, closings, especially those requiring flood insurance or government-backed rural home loans, could be.During that contract-signing period, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage came down for a bit but then moved up again. The popular 30-year rate started August at 6.63%, fell steadily to 6.13% by mid-September, and then came back up to 6.37% by the end of the month, according to Mortgage News Daily. It now stands at 6.36%.The inventory of homes for sale has also come down. After gaining for much of this year, supply fell to 1.52 million units, down 0.7% from September, although still nearly 11% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.4-month supply, still considered lean.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.And that's why prices are still gaining. The median price of a home sold in October was $415,200, an increase of 2.1% from October 2024 and the 28th consecutive month of annual gains. \"Looking ahead, home shoppers in today's market face some advantages from falling mortgage rates and seasonally slower competition,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"At the same time, a lack of housing affordability continues to be a challenge keeping home sales in their historically low level.\"Homes are staying on the market longer, at an average of 34 days last month compared with 29 days last October. First-time buyers made a comeback in the market, representing 32% of sales, up from 27% a year ago — but not all regions are equal. \"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"Sales growth continues to be strongest on the high end of the market. Homes priced above $1 million saw sales up more than 16% from a year ago, and those priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw a gain of 10%. Meanwhile sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 were up just about 1%, and homes priced below $100,000 saw a drop in sales of nearly 3%. ",

Brian Rothmuller | Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesMajor League Baseball officially announced a new three-year media rights agreement with NBC, Netflix and ESPN on Wednesday, foreshadowing the league's more significant TV deal to come in 2028.The new deal stems from ESPN's decision to opt out of its \"Sunday Night Baseball\" package earlier this year. ESPN struck a new deal with MLB, acquiring the rights to MLB.TV and a midweek game package. NBC Sports will take over the Sunday Night games, and Netflix will be the new home for the next three Home Run Derbies. All the deals begin with the 2026 season.CNBC previously reported most of the details of the agreement in August.\"Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,\" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The new deal foreshadows MLB's quest to raise TV revenue at the end of the 2028 season, when it will get these rights back plus existing broadcast rights from Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, MLB had to take a haircut of about $300 million per year relative to what ESPN had been paying before opting out earlier this year. NBC is paying about $200 million a year for its new package, and Netflix is paying about $50 million annually for the Derby, CNBC reported in August. The two packages, together, roughly make up what ESPN had been paying for.Even so, MLB has a chance to expand its reach through the new and streaming-exclusive partners.The average ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game averaged 1.8 million viewers this past season.The loss in revenue for the Sunday Night package suggests MLB may have to get creative with the way it carves up new packages of games in 2028 to ensure it continues to grow media revenue. In aggregate, the league is now making more in overall media revenue, but it needed to sell ESPN rights and games it hadn't previously offered. ESPN is paying about $550 million for its new package, CNBC reported in August.The NBA nearly tripled its national media revenue in its most recent rights deal, and the NFL is so confident it can generate a huge increase on the deal it signed in 2021 that it's open to accelerating talks with its current media partners as early as next year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in September.New deal detailsESPN's new deal allows it sell and distribute MLB.TV, the league's out of market streaming service, through the ESPN app. ESPN will also receive a new 30-game midweek package of live games on ESPN's linear networks and the ESPN app. ESPN also will sell and distribute MLB Network and in-market games for select MLB teams via the ESPN app. Those teams are the Cleveland Guardians, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies — franchises whose games have been produced and distributed by MLB after the collapse of regional sports networks that carried those teams.NBC will now have MLB, NBA and NFL on Sunday for its broadcast network, its new cable sports channel, and its Peacock streaming service. NBC will also carry MLB's entire Wild Card round, ranging from eight to 12 games each season. In addition to three years of the Home Run Derby, Netflix will own the rights to a singular game on Opening Night for the next three seasons. Netflix will also exclusively deliver all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",

    "body": "Students are seen on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 14, 2025.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal authorities released Columbia University student Elmina Aghayeva on Thursday afternoon, hours after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered a university residential hall in New York City and took the native of Azerbaijan into custody, the school said.New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani earlier said President Donald Trump had called to tell him that Aghayeva would be released following a meeting at the White House, where the mayor had urged the president to set her free.Aghayeva was arrested by ICE agents at around 6:30 a.m. in Manhattan.Columbia University's acting president, Claire Shipman, accused ICE of entering university property under false pretenses.\"Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a 'missing person,' \" and then detained Aghayeva, Shipman said in an email obtained by CNBC.All law enforcement agents require a judicial warrant or subpoena to enter housing and other non-public campus areas, Shipman said in the email. Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, in an X post, said that ICE \"used a phony missing persons bulletin\" about a 5-year-old girl.\"They purposefully deceived campus housing/security to gain entry to the student's apartment,\" Hoylman-Sigal wrote. \"The level of civil rights violations that took place is staggering.\"The federal agents identified themselves as police looking for a missing child when entering the building, Shipman alleged in a separate email to the campus community Thursday night. Camera footage showed agents in the hallway sharing pictures of the purported child, she added.Shipman added that federal agents did not produce a warrant despite repeated requests from a Columbia University public safety officer. They also refused to allow the officer to call his boss, Shipman added.\"This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,\" Shipman said in the email.A Department of Homeland Security official told CNBC that ICE agents arrested Aghayeva, whose student visa was terminated by the Obama administration in 2016, after \"the building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.\"\"She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,\" said the official, whose agency oversees ICE.The incident comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan earlier this month said the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, sparking backlash against the White House's efforts.Columbia has been in the Trump administration's crosshairs since the president returned to office last year.The Education Department in June said the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration cut.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released in June after three months in ICE detention.",

    "body": "Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos arrives at the White House in Washington, Feb. 26, 2026.Andrew Leyden | Getty ImagesNetflix is walking away from a deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets after the WBD board on Thursday deemed a revised bid by Paramount Skydance to be a superior offer. Earlier this week, Paramount raised its bid to buy the entirety of WBD to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, all cash. It was the latest amendment to Paramount's multiple offers in recent months — and since moving forward with a hostile bid to buy the company — and it's now unseated a deal between WBD and Netflix to sell the legacy media company's studio and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share. Last week, Netflix granted WBD a seven-day waiver to reengage with Paramount, resulting in the higher bid. Paramount's offer is for the entirety of WBD, including its pay-TV networks, such as CNN, TBS and TNT. Netflix had four business days to make changes to its own proposal in light of Paramount's superior bid, the WBD board said in a statement Thursday. Instead, the decision by the streaming giant to walk away puts a pin in a drawn-out saga that saw amended offers from both bidders.\"Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement, referring to Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters and CFO Spencer Neumann. \"Once our Board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world.\"Netflix stock spiked 10% in extended trading Thursday, while Paramount stock gained 5%. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery fell 2%.\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Sarandos and Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"The latest Paramount bid included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. The company also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if that deal didn't go through. Sarandos told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an interview last week that Netflix granted WBD the waiver to reopen Paramount talks in order to give shareholders clarity. \"Paramount had been making a ton of noise, flooding the zone with confusion for shareholders ... including floating all these hypothetical offers and talking directly to the shareholders and bypassing the Warner Bros. Discovery board,\" Sarandos said at the time. \"So we've given the opportunity to get those shareholders exactly what they deserve, which is complete clarity and certainty.\"However, Sarandos had fallen short of commenting on whether Netflix would up its own offer to match a revised Paramount bid. And Thursday, Sarandos attended meetings at the White House to discuss the potential tie-up.\"Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process,\" the Netflix co-CEOs said in their statement. \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S.,\" they said. \"But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price.\" ",

Cuba's coast guard said on February 25, 2026, it shot dead four people and wounded six others traveling in a US-registered speedboat during an exchange of fire near Cuba's shores that came amid heightened tensions with Washington.Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday said that the situation in fuel-starved Cuba is intensifying after a deadly incident with a U.S.-registered speedboat off the coast of the Caribbean island. \"We see that the situation around Cuba is escalating,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.\"The most important thing is the humanitarian component. Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said. The comments come shortly after Cuba's Interior Ministry said border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters. The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island. The individuals, all of whom were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's Interior Ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as \"highly unusual\" and said the White House would \"respond appropriately\" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

The Trump administration has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching a military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.U.S. President Donald Trump has since said Cuba's government poses \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.

The United Nations has warned of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" in Cuba as the country's oil supplies dwindle.Mexico, for its part, sent a new shipment of humanitarian aid to Cuba this week. The ships set sail from the port of Veracruz on Tuesday with a total of roughly 1,200 metric tons of food supplies, according to Mexico's Foreign Ministry. \"The people of Mexico maintain their tradition of solidarity with the peoples of Latin America, and particularly with the people of Cuba. Our country has always provided assistance to our sister nations in need,\" the ministry said in a statement.The food supplies are expected to arrive in Cuba on Saturday.",

    "body": "A sign of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is seen on the top of a building in Basel, Switzerland, Sept. 9, 2025.Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesNovartis, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Genentech, a major biotech firm, say they've uncovered a \"dangerous scheme\" to import their allergy medication from Canada into the U.S. in violation of U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations.Both are suing SHARx — a so-called alternative funding program — and a Canadian pharmacy over the importation of Xolair, an injectable prescription medication for patients with severe asthma, food allergies and respiratory conditions, to an allergy and asthma center in Michigan.\"Biological medicines, like the U.S. Xolair medicine, require particular care because their complex composition and sensitivity to variation in storage and handling conditions are susceptible to contamination and degradation that could undermine their safety and efficacy,\" according to the lawsuit, filed on Feb. 2 in U.S. District Court in Michigan.The suit said the scheme circumvents FDA regulations that generally prohibit importation of unapproved medications from overseas. The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the importation of the drug. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a CNBC investigation that revealed a growing class of businesses called alternative funding programs, or AFPs, which promise to connect patients with more affordable options for accessing medications that often come at very high costs. The AFPs are able to obtain the overseas drugs at a substantially reduced price.Federal authorities told CNBC last year that importing medications from foreign markets is illegal and could pose risks to patients' health.watch nowAFPs contract with employer-sponsored health plans to offer coverage on specialty drugs. They often work with private employers, school districts, local governments and unions.CNBC's investigation revealed that in at least one case, an employer required its staff to obtain their high-cost medication through SHARx or said it wouldn't be covered. SHARx last year defended its business model, telling CNBC it provides an alternative to expensive drugs in the U.S. SHARx, which is based in St. Louis, Missouri, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment about the lawsuit.According to the complaint, the shipment of Xolair to the Michigan allergy center came from Campbell Heights Pharmacy in British Columbia, Canada. The pharmacy also did not respond to a request for comment.The suit said SHARx \"continues to brazenly deceive patients into believing they are receiving the same safe, securely supplied medicines that they would receive from a U.S. retail pharmacy.\"The drug has strict shipping and temperature controls, the suit said.Drugs not approved for the U.S. market that are shipped from overseas can result in contamination, potentially leading to \"serious patient injury and even death,\" the suit said.A separate lawsuit, filed in late 2024 by Gilead Sciences, similarly alleges that other alternative funding programs illegally import medications. The AFPs in the case, which is pending, have denied any wrongdoing.",

Retail is not behind the selling that led to a lackluster reaction to the blockbuster results, Patel said.There's a caveat: Patel said there's strong selling in addition to buying in the chipmaker. That can help explain the stock's rocky action in morning trading, he added.\"Flows have been two-way,\" Patel wrote in a Thursday note. \"Total retail turnover in [Nvidia] has been pretty epic too at the start of the session.\"Thursday's action comes on the heels of the AI darling's earnings, which beat analyst expectations and came with strong guidance.

Average daily net flow over the five-day window ahead of the release was $94 million, around half of what was seen in the runup to the prior report, Vanda said Wednesday.Nvidia has been a top stock for retail investors since 2023, Vanda data shows.

As part of the settlement, the CFPB banned the company from handling federal education loans, although it continues to play a role in the private student loan market. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.Here's what borrowers should know about the settlement compensation. Qualifying borrowers are those put in forbearanceIf you had federal student loans with Navient and your account was placed in a forbearance in 2017 or earlier, you may qualify to receive a check, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Over the years, the U.S. Department of Education has transferred many borrowers between student loan servicers, once or even multiple times. You should be able to pull up a record of the companies that have managed your debt at Studentaid.gov. Navient's federal student loan accounts were originally transferred to Mohela, and may have subsequently been switched to Aidvantage, Nelnet or EdFinancial.Asked this week about the settlement payments, Cate Fitzgerald, a spokesperson for Navient, said, \"the CFPB is responsible for administering the funds and, under our agreement, identifying the borrowers who will receive them.\"The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. On its website, the bureau directs consumers with questions about settlement compensation to call the third-party payments administrator, Rust Consulting, at 1-800-711-8418 or email navient_info@rustcfpbconsumerprotection.org. At least 100,000 borrowers may get a checkThe CFPB has not shared the number of borrowers who will be compensated under the settlement. However, Kantrowitz estimates that at least 100,000 people could get a check, based on his analysis of historical data of Navient borrowers in forbearance. The typical payment will likely be several hundred dollars, Kantrowitz said. Borrowers on Reddit have so far reported settlement payments of up to $2,000. \"I'm happy to see that debtors are already receiving these checks that they're entitled to,\" Barnard said. Financial consequences of forbearances When a borrower enters forbearance, they are not required to make payments, but interest typically continues to accrue on their loans. As the Navient settlement showed, forbearances can be costly for borrowers. While it can be tempting to put your loan payments on hold, your balance can grow much larger and, therefore, be harder to repay when the relief period ends. In March 2017, the average loan amount in forbearance by Navient was around $43,000, Kantrowitz found. That means a borrower's balance would spike by nearly $3,000 each year their bill was paused, assuming a 6.8% interest rate, he estimated. Borrowers are better off finding a repayment plan they can afford, consumer advocates say.",

    "body": "Republican lawmakers are pushing to place limits on the ability of U.S. companies to sell advanced semiconductors to China — an effort that has run afoul of some key figures in the Trump administration.The effort also pits China hawks on the Hill against Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has repeatedly made the pitch to lawmakers and government official that the more U.S. chips are used in China, the more U.S. companies will be a leader in the space. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., is at the forefront of ensuring artificial intelligence and chips are being viewed as a national security asset — and he isn't afraid to call Huang out directly.  \"The joke here is, Jensen wants us to trust the CCP,\" Mast told CNBC in an interview, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \"Anybody watching this should laugh.\"In the latest salvo, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced legislation that would allow Congress 30 days to review and block sales of advanced chips to adversarial countries — similar to the power Congress has with arms and weapons sales. It would also cancel all existing export licenses to countries like China until the government submits a detailed strategy about how the chips would impact military and intelligence. All but two members of the committee voted to advance the measure. There is already a companion bill in the Senate with bipartisan backing from Sens. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\"We are in an AI arms race, and it's important that we know where the AI arms dealers are selling,\" Mast said in the interview. He said while Congress has no right to interfere with chips being sold for video games and other commercial purposes, \"when it blends into the world of now, it's real war, real weapon systems, real casualties at the highest level of all militaries, yeah, we're going to have a say.\"Mast added that Huang \"might not like it, but that's what's going to take place.\"Nvidia said in a statement to CNBC the likelihood of China's military using American chips was low as \"it makes no sense for the Chinese military to depend on American technology.\"The company added that the \"administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America's lead in AI.\"Mast, a supporter of Trump's, said the committee was in sync with the White House, and the bill codified provisions in a recent Commerce Department regulation that permitted the sale of advanced chips to China. Both the bill and regulation ban advanced chips from being licensed in a way that could benefit the Chinese military, although the Commerce Department doesn't give lawmakers the power to block a sale. Despite strong support, the bill faces an uphill climb to get to the floor. Ahead of the vote in committee, David Sacks, the White House's AI czar, retweeted a post from the X account Wall Street Mav that slammed the bill, saying it \"handicaps Trump's ability to strategically position the USA favorably against China.\"Sacks quoted the tweet, adding \"Correct.\"Mast pushed back, saying that the talking points of the accounts Sacks boosted matched the talking points he'd heard from Nvidia. \"What he was promoting was literally mercenary influencers, about a dozen of them, telling literal lies,\" Mast said. Mast said he worked with others in the administration on the bill prior to the vote in committee. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The committee isn't done with its oversight of chips. Mast is also planning a vote on a bill requiring exported advanced chips contain a mechanism to verify their location — and would require exporters to flag the government if a chip wound up in an unauthorized location. The bill, known as the Chip Security Act, has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate",

    "body": "Nvidia H100 chips inside a server room at the Yotta Data Services Pvt. data center, in Navi Mumbai, India, March 14, 2024.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia's Yotta Data Services, which is building a $2 billion artificial intelligence hub using Nvidia's chips, said demand for graphic processing units in the country is exceeding supply as domestic AI models prepare to scale and the local user base surges.At present, India trails the U.S. and China in the race to develop a native AI foundational model and lacks large domestic AI infrastructure. That is beginning to shift.Last week, during the India AI summit, a few Indian companies launched early or limited versions of their AI models, such as Sarvam AI's Indus chatbot.\"We're gradually rolling out Indus on a limited compute capacity, so you may hit a waitlist at first. We will expand access over time,\" Pratyush Kumar, co-founder of Sarvam AI, said in a post on X.Most Indian AI models launched at the AI summit were trained on Nvidia's GPUs hosted in Yotta's facilities, Sunil Gupta, co-founder, managing director and CEO of the company told CNBC's Inside India on Thursday.The Mumbai-based data center company, which began sourcing Nvidia GPUs in 2023, now owns 60% to 70% of India's GPU capacity, Gupta said. He added that demand is also expected to come from global AI companies as their user base in India expands.watch nowPush for more data centers In recent months, U.S. tech majors such as OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have offered their AI tools at low or no cost to millions of users in India. Among hyperscalers, Google has firmed up its plans to invest $15 billion to build a data center hub in southern India, while Microsoft will invest $17.5 billion to expand its data center footprint.Last week, OpenAI became the first customer of India's Tata Consultancy Services' data center business, signing up for 100 MW of capacity, with an option to scale to 1 GW. \"Through OpenAI for India, we're working together to build the infrastructure, skills, and local partnerships needed to build AI with India, for India, and in India,\" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement on Feb. 19.As the Indian user base of leading global AI companies expands, Gupta said they will require local data centers and GPU capacity. Yotta plans to fund additional GPU purchases through a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion pre-IPO round and aims to list within the next 12 months, Gupta added. India has a total data center capacity of 1.93 gigawatt in 2025 and is projected to nearly double to 4 gigawatt  by 2028, according to a Feb. 20 report by Nomura.During the AI Summit, many companies announced plans to invest $277 billion over the next five to seven years, most of which will be directed towards building AI infrastructure in India, the brokerage said.\"Majority of these investments will flow into data centers, with domestic and US firms leading hyperscale buildouts and positioning India as a key US technology partner,\" the brokerage said.",

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive refunds of $100 on average, though State Farm says the amount will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in cost savings for customers.That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid $1 billion in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business. Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowFanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment announced fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that missed Wall Street expectations on nearly every metric. FanDuel's performance in the final quarter of 2025 was affected by bettors losing more often than usual.  When that happens, gamblers get discouraged, bet less and stop using the app as frequently, Flutter CEO Peter Jackson told CNBC in an interview.\"It's fair to say, not everything went our way in the fourth quarter,\" Jackson said. Shares of Flutter fell almost 7% in extended trading Thursday. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter, compared with Wall Street consensus: Revenue: $4.74 billion vs. $4.97 billion, according to LSEGAdjusted EPS: $1.74 vs. $1.95, according to LSEGFor the fourth quarter, Flutter reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $832 million, below the $893 million that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount. Its fourth-quarter revenue marked a year-over-year increase of 25%. And yet, Flutter's 2026 revenue guidance of $17.75 billion to $19.05 billion was lower than analysts' projection of $19.34 billion for the year. On the company's earnings call, Jackson told investors that prediction markets would likely spur more legalization of sports betting by the states. He also said the company has found no evidence that prediction markets are cannibalizing the sportsbook business. ",

The stock skyrocketed more than 24% in extended trading. \"Today we shared a difficult decision with our team,\" Jack Dorsey, Block's co-founder and CEO, wrote in a letter to shareholders. \"We're reducing Block by nearly half, from over 10,000 people to just under 6,000, which means that over 4,000 people are being asked to leave or entering into consultation.\"Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the job cuts will position the company \"for our next phase of long term growth.\"\"We are choosing to shift how we operate at a time when our business is accelerating and we see an opportunity to move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work,\" Ahuja wrote. Dorsey said he expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from \"intelligence tools.\" \"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" Dorsey said. \"I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.\" Read more CNBC tech newsEBay laying off about 800 roles, or 6% of its workforceGoogle launches Nano Banana 2, updating its viral AI image generatorNvidia still hasn't sold its U.S.-approved China AI chipsNvidia's Jensen Huang says markets 'got it wrong' on AI threat to software companiesOther companies like Pinterest, CrowdStrike and Chegg have recently announced job cuts and directly attributed the layoffs to AI reshaping their workforces. In an X post, Dorsey said he was faced with the choice of laying off staffers over several months or years \"as this shift plays out,\" or to \"act on it now.\" \"I chose the latter,\" Dorsey wrote. \"Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.\" The company had 10,205 employees worldwide as of Dec. 31, 2025, according to its annual filing.

Earlier this week, eBay reached a settlement with a Massachusetts couple who were victims of a harassment campaign waged by several former employees. David and Ina Steiner sued eBay in federal court in 2021 after they were stalked and harassed by employees who were angered by coverage on their blog, EcommerceBytes. Two former eBay executives were given prison time in 2022 over the scheme. Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed.Read more CNBC tech newsEBay laying off about 800 roles, or 6% of its workforceGoogle launches Nano Banana 2, updating its viral AI image generatorNvidia still hasn't sold its U.S.-approved China AI chipsNvidia's Jensen Huang says markets 'got it wrong' on AI threat to software companiesEBay has continued to trim its head count in recent years, while at the same time spending more on artificial intelligence. The company has implemented AI tools internally, and looked to infuse the technology across its buyer and seller experiences. It's also partnered with OpenAI on its agentic web browser.The investments come as eBay is vying to compete with larger, faster-growing rivals Amazon and Walmart, and other online marketplaces like Etsy, TikTok Shop, Temu and Shein. EBay last week announced plans to acquire Etsy's secondhand clothing marketplace Depop for about $1.2 billion in cash. The deal should give eBay a greater leg up with consumers under the age of 34, which make up about 90% of Depop's user base. CEO Jamie Iannone said Depop would also allow eBay to expand its presence in fashion, which has emerged as one of the company's fastest-growing categories. The company has leaned into its other so-called focus categories, which include collectibles, car parts and accessories, and refurbished goods.EBay said in its fourth-quarter earnings report last week that gross merchandise volume from focus categories grew more than 16% year over year.watch now",

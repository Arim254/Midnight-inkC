    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "As a relationship counselor with over 10 years of experience, I've learned that even the strongest couples face conflict. What sets emotionally intelligent couples apart is their ability to stay connected, even when disagreements arise.I'm often more concerned about couples who never fight, because avoiding conflict entirely can hide unresolved hurts. After all, the closer you are, the more likely ruptures are to happen, and how you handle them matters.Here are three things emotionally intelligent couples do differently when they are in conflict.1. They don't assume the worst about their partner's intentWe've all been there. One sharp comment can seem like an attack on your character. For example, you forget to text back and it is interpreted as not caring. A request for space could be misconstrued as abandonment.Research shows that when couples are distressed, they're more likely to interpret a partner's behavior in ways that make it feel intentional, fixed, and personal (\"you did this because you're that kind of person\"). Psychologists call this \"negative attribution bias.\"Before conflicts devolve into defensiveness and character attacks, I give my clients a simple exercise.Write down what you want to say. For example, \"Why do you shut down every time I bring something up?\" Then cross out every sentence that diagnoses your partner's motives (\"you don't care,\" \"you're trying to…,\" \"you always…\").Next, try a reframe. Write down the observable behavior, its impact on you, and one clear, workable request: \"When you go silent in moments like this, I start filling in the gaps on my own. I tell myself you don't care or that I've done something wrong, and I feel alone pretty quickly. What would really help is just hearing where you are, even if you don't know what else to say yet.\"This is a great way to protect your relationship while still naming the problem and offering something constructive.2. They take responsibility for their emotions and plan how to regulate them togetherEmotionally intelligent couples don't expect their partner to fix their feelings, but they also don't shut each other out. A partner's presence can help them stay regulated and connected, even in anger or frustration.Pausing during conflict is one of the hardest skills. It's hardest when you're triggered and least able to access your tools. I often encourage couples to plan ahead with a \"clean pause\" script, like: \"I need 20 minutes so I don't say something I'll regret. I'll come back.\" Follow-through matters as much as the pause. Couples can also use co-regulation — small ways to calm together: \"Can we sit next to each other while we talk?\" or, \"Can I get a hug first, then we keep going?\"These strategies help partners stay connected while still taking responsibility for their own emotions.3. They stay curious, even during major conflicts When people feel threatened, the brain loves shortcuts. Emotionally intelligent couples slow this process down and become, in effect, investigators of each other's inner worlds.Curiosity has been associated with greater closeness and intimacy in conversations, especially during moments of disagreement.Part of why curiosity disappears whether it's one, 10, or 20 years in is because we start living off our assumptions. We tell ourselves we already know what our partner meant, what they felt, and why they did it because the person across from you is so familiar.The problem is that once you think you already know the story, you stop learning about your partner's actual experience. Conflict then becomes two competing narratives instead of a shared inquiry into what's really happening, even when you disagree.Instead of assuming the worst, the most emotionally intelligent couples will ask questions like:\"Can you help me understand what was happening for you?\"\"What did you hear me say?\"\"What part of this feels hardest?\"\"What's been on your mind lately that I haven't asked about?\"\"What's something you want more of right now?\"The strongest, most emotionally intelligent couples genuinely see who their partner is becoming, not who they want them to be or who they once were.

    "body": "Engagement season is upon us, with December being the most popular month to propose worldwide, according to The Knot.And while traditionally men have been expected to shell out for that diamond — as Beyoncé put it in 2008, he should've \"put a ring on it\" — many women are changing their expectations around who makes the purchase. Nearly 71% (70.6%) of women say they're willing to contribute to the cost of their engagement ring, according to DatingAdvice.com's recent Holiday Engagement Survey of 1,000 partnered U.S. adults.Almost 19% said they would pay for the ring in full, about 23% said they'd partially pay and 29% said they would contribute if needed. Here's why Natassia Miller, a certified sexologist who founded the sex and relationship coaching company Wonderlust, thinks women might be changing their tune. There are more dual-income couples these daysThere are more couples earning two salaries, with or without kids, than there were a decade ago, according to the Pew Research Center.And while, on average, the gender wage gap persists, there are some metro areas in the U.S. where women under the age of 30 earn as much as or more than their male counterparts, according to Pew. \"Today, with more dual‑income couples and women delaying marriage while they build careers,\" says Miller, \"there's more openness to treating the ring as a shared investment.\"Some 'couples are more pragmatic'This piece of jewelry is expensive: The average cost of an engagement ring is $5,200, according to The Knot.And headlines abound about Americans' financial hardships. Overall prices are up 25% since January 2020, for example, according to Consumer Price Index data, and nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma.\"Against that backdrop, it makes sense that couples are more pragmatic,\" says Miller. \"Instead of one partner taking on debt to hit an arbitrary ring budget, some women would rather share the cost and keep the purchase aligned with reality.​\"It's a 'public symbol' that says 'someone committed to me'Finally, even as they consider their financial realities, women are willing to pay because the ring is symbolic.\"Even women who are financially independent often grew up on a steady diet of rom‑coms, social media proposals, and bridal marketing where the ring is framed as proof of worthiness and desirability,\" says Miller.For many women, \"an engagement ring is still a public symbol that says, 'Someone committed to me, and is willing to show that to the world.'\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

[and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945.

(Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "description": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headline",
    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 900 U.S. flights were canceled and close to 8,000 were delayed Saturday after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 136 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Only 27 U.S. flights were listed as canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said.

    "body": "QTS's data center in Cambois, North East of EnglandWhen the U.K. announced its AI Opportunities Action Plan — a grand blueprint to deploy the tech across society — in January, Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared the strategy would make the country an \"AI superpower.\" One of the key pillars of this plan was a rapid buildout of data centres capable of providing the huge compute requirements for the rollout of AI. This would be driven by \"AI growth zones\" — designated areas with relaxed planning permission and improved access to power. Nearly one year on, and Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google have all committed billions of dollars to AI infrastructure in the country. Four AI growth zones have been unveiled, and homegrown startups like Nscale have emerged as key players in the space. But critics point to heavily restricted access to energy via the national grid and slow-moving buildouts as signs the country is at risk of lagging further behind global rivals in the AI race. \"Ambition and delivery are not yet aligned,\" Ben Pritchard, CEO of data center power supplier AVK, told CNBC. \"Growth has been held back largely by constraints around power availability. Grid bottlenecks, in particular, have slowed the pace of development and mean the U.K. is not yet deploying infrastructure quickly enough to keep pace with global competitors.\"Grid connection delaysIt is still early days in the U.K.'s AI infrastructure buildout as AI growth zones are currently in their initial phases of development.A site in Oxfordshire, the first to be announced in February, has yet to begin building work and is still considering delivery partner proposals. Ground preparation work has begun at one in the North East of England, announced in September, with formal building beginning early 2026.Two more sites, in North and South Wales were unveiled in November. The former is searching for an investment partner, which the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSIT) told CNBC it expects to be confirmed in the coming months. The latter is made up of a cluster of sites, some of which are already operational with additional construction work to be done on others, DSIT said. watch nowThe U.K. government said in July it was targeting a core group of AI growth zones serving at least 500 megawatts of demand by 2030, with at least one scaling to more than one gigawatt by that time.But the most serious challenge to realising those ambitions is the U.K.'s limited grid capacity, said Pritchard.\"Developers expect grid connection delays of eight to ten years, and the volume of outstanding connection requests, especially around London, is unprecedented,\" he told CNBC. AI workloads are also \"dramatically increasing energy demand\" as businesses and consumers begin to use the tech, putting additional pressure on a stretched energy system, Pritchard added. \"They are no longer isolated risks; they are actively slowing down or blocking developments across the country.\"The open call for applications for the AI growth zone initiative created a situation where landowners with pylons or powercables running across their land applied for the designation, said Kao Data's Spencer Lamb.\"This resulted in the national grid being inundated with power grid applications from speculative sources,\" with no realistic chance of success, he told CNBC.Laying the groundworkThe National Energy System Operator (Neso) — The U.K.'s public body responsible for managing the national grid — has made moves to fix the situation. Earlier this month it announced plans to prioritise hundreds of projects for faster access to the grid. Neso declined to comment on whether AI infrastructure projects were among those prioritised when asked by CNBC, but did say a significant portion were data centers.There have also been big money commitments from tech giants, many of which were paraded by the U.K. government in September.Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, CoreWeave and others announced billions of dollars of AI investment during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, which involved plans to deploy the latest chips in the country and open new data centers. Homegrown startup Nscale, which provides access to AI compute and is building data centers, also announced deals to deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia chips at an AI factory just outside London by early 2027.Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip is displayed at the company's GTC conference in San Jose, California, on March 19, 2025.Max A. Cherney | Reuters\"Investment from major private players has laid important groundwork,\" Puneet Gupta, general manager for the U.K. and Ireland at data infrastructure company NetApp, told CNBC. \"Momentum is also building around national research supercomputers and plans for new compute capacity, with commitments to build AI 'gigafactories' in the UK.\"But the \"real test\" will be how quickly those plans translate into usable compute for U.K. organisations, said Gupta.Avoiding an AI infrastructure 'sugar rush'The long-term success of the country's AI infrastructure buildout will require it to invest in the \"full stack,\" including data pipelines, storage, energy sourcing, security, talent and skills, Stuart Abbott, U.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST Data, told CNBC. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"Stuart AbbottU.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST DataThat means \"developing an operational fabric that lets real institutions deploy AI safely at scale,\" he added. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"The challenges are significant. The value of data center deals in Europe pales in comparison to sums funneled into projects in the U.S. The U.K. also currently has the costliest energy in Europe, which is around 75% higher than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and legacy grid infrastructure which can take many years to connect to new sites.One potential solution for projects that are unable to secure access to the national grid are microgrids, AVK's Pritchard said. Microgrids are self-contained power networks from sources like engines, renewables and batteries. AVK is currently designing two microgrids for partners building cloud compute, though not for AI, in the U.K. They can take around three years to build and cost around 10% more than energy from the grid at the moment, according to Pritchard. Co-locating compute where power already exists, rather than \"forcing everything to be greenfield\" — the term for undeveloped sites — is also a way to get AI infrastructure up and running faster, VAST Data's Abbot said.The pace of implementation will be critical, Kao Data's Lamb told CNBC. \"Unless fundamental issues around energy availability and pricing, AI copyright and funding for AI developments are solved quickly, the U.K. will miss out on one of the most remarkable economic opportunities of our time and ultimately risks becoming an international AI backwater.\"",

    "body": "This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of salesGuillaume Payen | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIt has been a monumental year for the video game industry, marked by new devices and billion-dollar deals.Further consolidation occurred within the sector when a consortium led by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, alongside Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake, announced plans to take Electronic Arts private. The $55 billion deal, which includes $20 billion in debt financing, is the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.The move could have major implications for EA, according to Omdia analysts. They said the question now is whether the PIF plans to run EA as a \"PR project\" or \"to extract maximum returns\" from the company. French game developer Ubisoft looked to turn its fortunes around this year, although it started 2025 with a second delay to the latest entry in its flagship Assassin's Creed series, Shadows.Ubisoft's shares received a boost in March after announcing the creation of a new gaming subsidiary with Chinese tech giant Tencent called Vantage Studios. The new developer, which will be part-owned by Tencent, will focus on Ubisoft's key IP — Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.watch nowDespite Ubisoft's efforts, shares have lost just over half of their value year to date, and the stock is down over 90% from its 2021 high.In contrast, Take-Two Interactive's shares continued to climb throughout 2025, as anticipation mounted for the next Grand Theft Auto title. It's been 12 years since the previous edition, GTA 5, was released on Xbox 360 and PS3.However, with radio silence on GTA 6 for most of the year, fans speculated that an additional delay from the May 26, 2026, release date was on the cards, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick telling CNBC in May that he had a \"very, very high conviction\" the scheduled date would be achievable. In November this year, the game was pushed back to Nov. 19, 2026, with shares in Take-Two tumbling on the news.The game will launch in the twilight window for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S — six years after both consoles were released. As focus shifts to the next generation of consoles, this past generation has seen a change in strategy for both brands. Console strategies shiftXbox has moved away from exclusive games, with titles such as Indiana Jones, Forza Horizon, and more releasing on PS5, while PlayStation continues to experiment further with releasing titles on PC. Take-Two's Zelnick argued that the shifting strategies will see the video game industry become more open. When asked whether the console will be in business within the next five to 10 years, he said the consoles will still be around, with the devices moving towards PC as \"business is moving towards open rather than closed.\"\"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours, that you play on a big screen, that's never going away,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in November.Consoles still have a huge role to play in the market, according to George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst for Games at Omdia. He told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the devices are still \"the go-to place for premium games.\"Data from Omdia shows that consoles are the second-largest category when it comes to total consumer spend, with mobile spend contributing 60%, consoles reaching 23%, and PCs hitting 16%. While others mostly abandoned exclusive titles, Nintendo has continued to pursue the strategy, releasing several exclusive titles for its new Switch 2 console – including an open-world reimaging of Mario Kart and a brand-new Donkey Kong game. This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of sales.Not all are convinced by Nintendo's strategy. Christopher Dring, founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business, told CNBC's \"Built for Billions\" in November that Nintendo faces a challenge in maintaining demand for its systems.\"Unlike PlayStation and Xbox and other platforms, the people buying Nintendo machines are buying it for Nintendo games.

    "body": "Mixmike | E+ | Getty ImagesMany student loan borrowers have hit a repayment obstacle: the U.S. Department of Education denied their application to switch into a new payment plan.The department rejected 327,955 borrower requests to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan in August alone, according to a Dec. 15 court filing. The denials mean many of these borrowers may remain stuck in their prior repayment plan with a higher monthly payment, or in an interest-accruing forbearance. As of the end of November, another 802,730 IDR plan applications remain pending with the Education Department. Millions of student loan holders rely on IDR plans to afford their payments and eventually, to emerge from their debt. The plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, and lead to debt cancellation after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. Those pursuing the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which leads to debt erasure for public servants after a decade, also typically need to be enrolled in an IDR plan. Consumer advocates said they were alarmed by the number of denials.\"This could cause further delays — losing out on qualifying months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and IDR cancellation — and many of these borrowers will wind up paying a higher amount each month,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The teacher's union, which represents nearly 2 million members, filed a lawsuit against the administration in March, accusing it of depriving student loan borrowers of their rights. Protect Borrowers served as AFT's legal counsel.Here's what to know about the recent IDR plan application denials — and what to do next if it happened to you. Why some IDR applications were rejected The Education Department said in the court filing that it rejected the hundreds of thousands of IDR applications because of an \"unforeseen ambiguity\" about which repayment plan the borrowers should have been enrolled in.  These federal student loan holders had requested to be put in the plan with \"the lowest monthly payment,\" according to the filing. But Trump officials said two plans result in an equal monthly bill. \"In response, ED opted to procedurally deny such applications,\" the agency said in the court document.Yu said the Trump administration's reasoning did not follow established guidelines. \"The IDR application anticipated two possible repayment plans with equal payment amounts and provided a plan for such a case,\" Yu said. In these situations, there is a ranking of IDR plans the Education Department is supposed to follow, she added. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz also said he questioned the Trump officials' explanation. \"The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak,\" Kantrowitz said. What borrowers should do next The difficulty accessing an affordable student loan repayment plan comes at an already trying time for borrowers. More than 5 million student loan holders are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Education Department confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that it will begin garnishing the wages of borrowers in default on student loans in early January. The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak.Mark Kantrowitz higher education expertIf your application for an IDR plan was rejected, file a new request as soon as possible, said Kantrowitz.Borrowers should select a specific plan on their application, \"partly because the borrower should make an informed decision,\" Kantrowitz said, and also because of the recent denials related to ambiguity over which plan has the lowest monthly payment. The Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan is now defunct, after a court blocked the program. And President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out some other IDR plans.As a result, the best current option for many borrowers is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, Kantrowitz said. Under the terms of IBR, borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income each month — though that share rises to 15% for certain borrowers with older loans.There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans.You can submit a request for an IDR plan at StudentAid.gov.",

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, artificial intelligence model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised more than $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an initial public offering in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesIt's been two days since news broke that Nvidia was spending $20 billion to acquire top talent from Groq in what the chip startup called a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, hasn't issued a press release or regulatory filing and, according to a spokesperson, is only confirming the contents of Groq's 90-word blog post published after the close of holiday-shortened trading on Wednesday. \"They're so big now that they can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release and nobody bats an eye,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, in a Friday interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" While neither company confirmed the price tag, CNBC learned from Groq lead investor Alex Davis on Wednesday that Nvidia had agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash.

Its biggest prior purchase happened in 2019, when Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion.But Nvidia is instead following a playbook used by other tech giants over the last couple years, spending billions of dollars to hire top talent in AI and to get access to key technology through licensing agreements. It's a strategy that's been employed by Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Nvidia itself previously used the tactic, shelling out more than $900 million in September to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.By avoiding traditional acquisitions, tech companies have been able to skirt some level of antitrust scrutiny and quickly close deals to bring in the people they most covet. \"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive,\" Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. His firm recommends buying Nvidia shares and has a $275 price target on the stock.Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% on Friday to $190.53. The stock has gained 42% this year and is up thirteenfold since the end of 2022, when generative AI started taking off following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Nvidia has been using its expanding cash pile to spread capital across the AI ecosystem, including through recent investments in OpenAI and Intel. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.Widening the 'competitive moat'Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, the search giant's custom chips that are being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Groq's specialty is on the inference side of the market, which refers to the the use of AI to make decisions based on new information. Nvidia dominates the training piece of the market, which involves teaching AI models to learn from patterns in large amounts of data. Analysts at Cantor said in a report Friday that Nvidia is \"playing both offense and defense\" by snapping up Groq's assets, keeping them from potentially landing in the hands of a competitor. \"We think this acquisition only enhances Nvidia's full system stack and overall leadership in the AI market (and only widens its competitive moat),\" wrote the analysts, who kept their buy rating and $300 price target. BofA Securities analysts also maintained their buy recommendation and $275 target following the announcement. In a note Friday, they characterized the deal as \"surprising, expensive but strategic,\" and said it shows Nvidia recognizes that \"while GPU dominated AI training, the rapid shift towards inference could require more specialized chips.\"The analysts said that key questions remain, such as who will own Groq's language processing unit intellectual property, whether it can be licensed to Nvidia competitors and whether what's left of Groq — its nascent cloud business — could possibly \"undercut NVDA's LPU-based service with lower pricing.\"Nvidia isn't commenting on any of those details for now. The first opportunity analysts and investors will likely get to hear from the company will be Jan. 5, when CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to speak at CES in Las Vegas. — CNBCs David Faber contributed to this reportWATCH: Nvidia GPUs to Google TPUs — Breaking down all the AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk speaks at a Q&A session following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | Pool | ReutersThree months ago Oracle named Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as its new CEOs. They're off to a rough start.Oracle shares have plummeted 30% so far this quarter. With four trading days remaining in the period, the stock is on pace for its sharpest decline since 2001 and the dot-com bust. Investors have grown skeptical about the database software vendor's ability to open more server farms for ChatGPT operator OpenAI, which agreed in September to spend more than $300 billion with Oracle.Earlier this month, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and free cash flow. On the earnings call, newly appointed finance leader Doug Kehring called for $50 billion in fiscal 2026 capital expenditures, 43% higher than the plan in September and double the total from a year earlier. Additionally, Oracle is plotting $248 billion in leases to boost cloud capacity, on top of building data centers.Such growth will require boatloads of debt. In September, Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. Kehring committed on the earnings call to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. But some skeptical investors are betting otherwise, pushing up the prices of Oracle's credit default swaps.\"Considering Oracle is already barely hanging on to an investment grade rating, we would be concerned about Oracle's ability to live up to these obligations without restructuring its OpenAI contract,\" analysts at D.A. Davidson wrote in a note to clients on Dec. 12. They have the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. Oracle declined to comment.watch nowMagouyrk and Sicilia's tenure began at a time of historic optimism. About two weeks before they took the reins from Safra Catz, Oracle reported a 359% revenue backlog tied heavily to OpenAI's commitment. That deal represented a major endorsement for Oracle, which was left off Gartner's list of top five cloud infrastructure providers by revenue for 2024.Following reports about the OpenAI agreement on Sept. 10, Oracle's stock shot up almost 36%, the third-sharpest rally since the company's 1986 IPO. The shares reached an intraday record of $345.72.\"We think $340 was terrifying,\" said Zachary Lountzis, vice president at Lountzis Asset Management, in an interview. Lountzis held $25 million in Oracle shares as of Sept. 30, according to a filing.The stock has since lost 43% of its value, closing on Wednesday at $197.49, though it got a bump last Friday after TikTok said it had agreed to sell part of its U.S. business to Oracle and other investors. Oracle has for years delivered cloud services to TikTok.Not 'betting against Larry'Lountzis said his team first bought Oracle shares in 2020, when the stock was below $60. It's held onto it stake through the recent highs and lows, picking up another roughly 30,000 shares in the first quarter of this year.\"Our philosophy is that we're OK with short-term overvaluation if the economics of the business have not changed, and that was the case with Oracle,\" Lountzis said. \"We didn't feel the economics of the business changed with all the largely positive news that came out. And I think what we've seen from $340 down to $180 is actually a very healthy correction.\" For Lountzis, much of his trust in the company comes down to Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977 and is now the world's second-richest person, according to Bloomberg.\"You would have gone bankrupt 40 times betting against Larry over the last 50 years,\" Lountzis said. \"He sees the future.\"watch nowIn October, Sicilia, Magouyrk and Kehring laid out a vision for a much faster-growing Oracle, with revenue set to step up to $225 billion in the 2030 fiscal year from $57 billion in fiscal 2025. Most of that growth will come from artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Nvidia's graphics processing units at the center of it. But while Magouryk was telling analysts to prepare for \"hypergrowth,\" such expansion would come at the expense of profitability, because Oracle's core software business commands much higher margins.  In fiscal 2021, Oracle's gross margin was 77%. Analysts polled by FactSet see it falling to about 49% in 2030, with about $34 billion in total negative free cash flow over the next five years before that figure turns positive in 2029.Eric Lynch, managing director at Florida's Suncoast Equity Management, said it's hard as an investor to get comfortable with Oracle's plans. \"Four or five years is a long time,\" Lynch said. \"That's just not within our investment discipline.\"Lynch also said he's worried about such heavy dependance on OpenAI, which is burning cash at a rapid rate and has committed to more than $1.4 trillion in total AI build-outs and investments. \"Will the demand be there from OpenAI?\" Lynch said.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin launched coverage of Oracle earlier this month with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $280 price target. He said the industry's perception will likely improve if Oracle follows through with OpenAI, which could account for more than one-third of the company's revenue by 2029, according to Turrin's estimate. \"They're kind of shifting away from more of a value-oriented business to a more growth-oriented business,\" Turrin said.A big challenge for Oracle remains picking up market share in cloud infrastructure, where the company badly trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google even though its customer roster includes names like Meta, Uber and Elon Musk's xAI.Databricks, which was just valued at $134 billion in a funding round, doesn't make its popular data processing software available on Oracle's cloud. That will happen \"when customers start banging on my door, saying, 'You need to run on Oracle,'\" Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview. \"Maybe it's getting there, but we just haven't heard that.\"Databricks rival Snowflake hasn't brought its services to Oracle either.Turrin said that Oracle's credibility in the market will hinge on the success of its AI build-out. \"Then customers start to look at this and say, wow, this company was trusted to build some of the largest training clusters in the world, and they're delivering on them,\" Turrin said. \"We should take a look at that too and figure out what's happening here.\" WATCH: How the massive power draw of generative AI is overtaxing our gridwatch now",

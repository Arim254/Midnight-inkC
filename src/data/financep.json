    "body": "Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, is known for her healthy habits and discipline when it comes to wellness.Since entering the spotlight three decades ago, the fashion designer's daily practices for peak health have evolved. While her diet remains consistent—fresh fish, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—her exercise routine and priorities have shifted now that she is in her 50s.Here are four ways Beckham's wellness routine has changed from the early 2000's to now.4 ways Victoria Beckham's wellness routine has changed1. She's more flexible with her diet\"I do try to be quite disciplined in the way that I eat,\" Beckham said on the BBC Radio program \"Gordon Ramsay's Perfect Christmas Lunch\" in 2006 at age 32.At the time, she prioritized a \"really healthy\" diet of fish, vegetables and fruit — and still does, she said. But these days Beckham is less rigid.\"I'm flexible with regards to food,\" Beckham told Net-a-Porter in 2020. \"My treat is a few glasses of red wine, and I also love tequila, and I do eat carbs. I have lots of avocado and really good fats, like salmon.\"2. She added weight training to her workoutsOver a decade ago, Beckham set a new year's resolution to start going to the gym, she told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never stopped. Once I get into something, I do it properly,\" she said.Back then, she would exercise for 90 minutes with a trainer, attend SoulCycle classes and run often, sometimes for eight miles. By 2023, her workout routine looked much different.\"I usually workout every morning prior to beginning my day and recently incorporated strength training into my routine which has been a fun way to switch up my regime,\" Beckham said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar.The following year, she shared that weight training at 50 made her feel \"stronger than I did when I was 20.\"3. Sleep is key for her self care nowIn 2013, Beckham's three sons were still in school and her daughter was just one. Beckham started her days between 6:15 and 6:30 a.m., and would fall asleep sometime between midnight and 1 a.m., she told Harper's Bazaar that year.At the time, she was getting between five and six hours of sleep a night. \"I like to get as much sleep as I can. But when you're a mummy, you kind of—well, it would be nice,\" Beckham said.Ten years later, she told the publication that her best advice for self care was developing a healthy sleep routine.\"Creating healthy sleep habits is incredibly important; it's become a key part of my self-care practice,\" she said.\"I've been working on incorporating less screen time and more mindfulness into my routine, which means putting my phone away before bedtime.\"4. Wellness shots and green smoothies are a staple in her routineBeckham also gets plenty of nutrients and vitamins from her daily beverages.Earlier this year, Vogue covered Beckham's morning routine based on stories shared to her personal Instagram account. The first thing she consumes every morning is apple cider vinegar, \"a couple of tablespoons on an empty tummy,\" she said.Then, she and her husband David Beckham have their green smoothies which include:BroccoliSpinachCucumberCeleryAvocadoAppleGingerLemonAfter a workout, Beckham has another smoothie with berries, bananas, apples and almonds. She rounds out her morning with a wellness shot of lemon, black pepper, fresh ginger and turmeric. \"One shot a day!!\" she said.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Cambridge Dictionary named \"parasocial\" as Word of the Year for 2025.Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesAI chatbots, Taylor Swift, and social media influencers all played a part in deciding Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, 2025: \"parasocial.\" Parasocial — revealed by the global dictionary on Tuesday as its word of the year — refers to the connection a person feels to an online personality ranging from celebrities to podcasters, and even artificial intelligence. \"Parasocial relationship is when we think we know someone, or we feel very close to someone who's in fact, a person we've never met, like a celebrity, an influencer, or somebody in public life who's famous for some reason,\" Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC Make It. \"In reality, of course, it's only a one-sided, so-called relationship,\" she added. The term originated in 1956 when University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl found that people who watched television were treating the actors on-screen like friends or family. Schnall explained that the \"phenomenon\" is well-known in our culture, but it's only now that people are using the term more commonly. \"It's been there forever, but I think in our culture, we now see parasocials on steroids, simply because there are so many opportunities for it. There are so many people who, for whatever reason, we can be interested in and fascinated by, inspired by,\" she said. One example is singer and billionaire Taylor Swift who has an intense global fanbase due to her relatable songs. Many of her fan report having a deep, emotional connection with her and keep up with her personal life and romantic relationships. Other examples include social media influencer and Youtuber Logan Paul who has around 27 million followers on Instagram and 23 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, Paul posted a video showing a deceased person in Japan's Aokigahara \"suicide forest,\" sparking global outrage. Many of his die‑hard fans defended him, showing fierce loyalty despite the seriousness of the content. Paul later apologized for the video. Schnall warned there are \"dangers\" in following celebrities and social media influencers who might share incorrect medical advice, sell bad products, or promote unethical behaviour.  \"They [influencers] could do some serious harm to their followers. The people who feel they're in that parasocial relationship, they could really be harmed by that,\" Schnall warned. AI chatbots and loneliness culture Cambridge Dictionary referenced that part of the increasing popularity of the word \"parasocial\" stems from relationships being formed with AI chatbots. A 2025 report by Common Sense Media, which surveyed 1,060 U.S. teens, found that 72% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had used an AI companion at least once. This was for a range of reasons from emotional or mental health support or as a friend or best friend. \"They're called chatbots because we feel like we're chatting with someone already,\" Schnall said. \"People can develop certain relationships, like a friendship or even romantic relationship, or at least, that's how they feel about it, when of course in reality, there is no one else involved.\" And it's not just teens. A recent survey by Vantage Point Counselling of over 1,000 American adults found that 28% said they have had a romantic or intimate relationship with an AI. Schnall offered two reasons why people are turning to parasocial relationships: a global loneliness epidemic and increased screentime. On phones and screens, parasocial relationships are \"just a click away\" so it's easier to get immediate social approval. Meanwhile, chatbots are designed to flatter you, per Schnall. \"People tend to be more lonely than in previous generations, and they spend so much time on their screens where these parasocial relationships are very easy to establish,\" she said.The antidote, Schnall said is investing in real-life relationships because the more time you spend online, the less time you spend pursuing in-person connections. \"The more time I spend chatting with a chatbot, the less time I probably spent chatting with a real life person,\" she added.

    "body": "Living alone with a $2,000 housing budget may be nearly impossible in some major cities — but in others you may be able to afford up to three bedrooms.Across the U.S., the average rent for a studio apartment listed on Apartments.com in October was $1,699 a month, and a two-bedroom space had an average rent of $1,887 per month, according to data collected and analyzed by Apartments.com in a November report. Of the 25 most populous cities in the U.S., New York, Boston and California cities San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose were the most expensive. Average rent for a studio apartment in these cities was over $2,000 in October, according to data from Apartments.com shared with CNBC Make It.With $2,000, you could get an average of 267 square feet in New York City, or one-third the size of a pickleball court, according to a normalized estimate from October listings. Compare that with Oklahoma City, the most affordable of the most populous cities, where $2,000 is worth about 1,900 square feet — more than two pickleball courts. While this data offers a useful benchmark for comparison across cities, it isn't necessarily indicative of the size of any single apartment a renter is likely to encounter. In reality, apartment sizes and prices can differ within the same city due to various factors, and renters should keep that in mind, the authors of the report said.Here's where $2,000 in rent would get you the least space in the 25 most populous cities in America:New York, N.Y.: 267 square feetBoston, Mass.: 336 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.: 340 square feetSan Diego, Calif.: 458 square feetSan Jose, Calif.: 427 square feetHere's where $2,000 in rent would get you the most space in the 25 most populous cities in America: Oklahoma City, Okla.: 1,900 square feetEl Paso, Texas: 1,762 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.: 1,676 square feetColumbus, Ohio: 1,633 square feetSan Antonio, Texas: 1,517 square feetHere's how much space you could get for $2,000 a month in all 25 of the most populous U.S. cities as of October.New York, N.Y.Unit type: N/A Average size for $2,000: 267 square feetLos Angeles, Calif.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 530 square feetChicago, Ill.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 679 square feetHouston, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,443 square feetPhoenix, Ariz.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,230 square feetPhiladelphia, Pa.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 772 square feetSan Antonio, TexasUnit type: Three BedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,517 square feetSan Diego, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 458 square feetDallas, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,154 square feetJacksonville, Fla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,453 square feetFort Worth, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,305 square feetSan Jose, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 427 square feetAustin, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,186 square feetCharlotte, N.C.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,235 square feetColumbus, OhioUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,633 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,676 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 340 square feetSeattle, Wash.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 534 square feetDenver, Colo.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 852 square feetOklahoma City, Okla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,900 square feetNashville, Tenn.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 863 square feetWashington, D.C.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 512 square feetEl Paso, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,762 square feetLas Vegas, Nev.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,354 square feetBoston, Mass.",

    "body": "Short of a cash windfall, saving for a down payment on a home can take years — and in some U.S. states, it may take decades.A new analysis from ConsumerAffairs estimates how long it would take to save a 10% down payment in every state by comparing each state's median household income with its median home price, along with median tax burdens and essential living costs.In Iowa, it would take about 8.7 years to save enough for a 10% down payment, the fastest of any state. In California, the estimate is 25.1 years — longer than any other state. Across all 50 states, the average timeline is 14.4 years, according to the study.These timelines rely on what the study calls \"fractional saving,\" which assumes a household sets aside 10% of its discretionary income each year. That approach was chosen because \"that's how people really save,\" Dayna Edens, media relations manager at ConsumerAffairs, tells CNBC Make It. \"Nobody's setting aside every spare penny for a down payment on a house they're not even shopping for yet.\"A 10% down payment was also chosen over the commonly recommended 20% as a more realistic target for first-time buyers, says Edens.Here's a look at the 10 states where it would take the least amount of time to save up a 10% down payment on a home, based on each state's median income, median home price and estimated household savings.1. IowaTime to save: 8.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,501Median home price: $247,4002. OhioTime to save: 9.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $72,212Median home price: $261,7003. TexasTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $79,721Median home price: $339,4004. MarylandTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $102,905Median home price: $439,3005. North DakotaTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $77,871Median home price: $298,2006. KansasTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,514Median home price: $292,6007. OklahomaTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $66,148Median home price: $252,9008. IllinoisTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $83,211Median home price: $303,3009. AlaskaTime to save: 10.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $95,665Median home price: $402,80010. IndianaTime to save: 11.0 yearsMedian annual household income: $71,959Median home price: $276,000The key factor in affordability is home price. All but one of these states have median home prices below the national median of $410,800, per U.S. Census data.In eight of the 10 states, median household income is roughly in line with the national median of $83,730, per U.S. Census data. The shorter timelines largely reflect lower home prices, not unusually high earnings.That pattern holds in many higher-income states as well. In places where median household income exceeds six figures, such as California and Hawaii, the timelines tend to run longer than in states with lower-cost homes. In those states, high living costs, especially housing, can offset the advantage of higher wages.Annual taxes and essential expenses also influence how much discretionary income households can save. Tax burdens vary by roughly $15,000 from state to state, and the annual cost of necessities ranges from the mid-$20,000s to the low-$40,000s, according to the study.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

    "body": "My wife and I recently celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary. In honor of the occasion, I asked couples who had been married 40, 50, or even 60 years a simple question: What relationship advice would you give to your younger selves? The participants ranged from a mid-60s couple who had just celebrated their 40th anniversary to a 99-year-old who had just celebrated 66 years of happiness with his bride. The advice captured more than 500 years of earned wisdom from these beautiful relationships. Here are 25 pieces of relationship advice that everyone needs to hear: Tell your partner you love them every night before falling asleep. Someday you'll find the other side of the bed empty and wish you could. Never keep score in love. Scoreboards are for sports games, not marriages. Laugh until you cry. Laughing together goes a long way to smooth the inevitable bumps in the road. Maintain interests and passions separate from your partner's. Marriage should not be the end of individuality. It can't always be 50/50. Sometimes it will be 90/10; sometimes it will be 10/90. All that matters is that it adds up to 100.One man said, \"Never stop dating. I'm 99 and still courting my wife!\" Marriages don't get boring; you stop trying. Keep doing the little things. A note under the pillow, a surprise bouquet, a peck on the cheek. Romance never goes out of style. Don't fear sadness, as it tends to sit right next to love.No one has ever argued their way to a happy marriage. When facing a challenge, face it together. Your spouse should always take priority over your birth family. Remember that when the two feel in conflict. Is it more important to be right or to be married? Stubborn pride is the downfall of relationships. Never raise your voice with your partner. Be quick to say, \"I'm sorry.\"Don't sweat the small stuff. If there's something bothering you, ask whether it will matter in one month. If not, let it go right now. Do one act of service for your partner every day, but never tell them about it. You cannot take care of your partner if you aren't taking care of yourself. Make a list of your daily needs to feel good and have your partner do the same. Make sure you and your partner are able to do the things on that list. Never involve non-professional third parties (parents, friends, siblings, coworkers) in disagreements. You'll forget about it, but they won't. Time doesn't heal when it comes to relationships. Don't delay difficult conversations. If your relationship has a minor issue, repair it. Minor issues become major issues over time. Every relationship is a work in progress. The mutual desire for improvement is what builds a lifelong bond.Complementarity is just as important as compatibility. Allow each other the space to lead within different domains in your relationship. Start every day with a hug or a kiss. It's a simple reminder of your love that goes a long way. Love is a muscle. Know that your love will be tested, but that each test has the potential to leave it stronger. It doesn't have to be perfect for it to be wonderful. There has never been a perfect relationship, but there have been many wonderful ones. Your love is yours. Forget the approval of others. You won't be able to make everyone happy. Accept that and embrace each other. In a separate but related series of conversations, I asked a 94-year-old woman what advice she would give to her younger self. She delivered this beautiful insight I'll close with: \"When in doubt, love. The world can always use more love.\"Sahil Bloom is an entrepreneur, investor, and inspirational writer and content creator who writes the biweekly newsletter, The Curiosity Chronicle.

    "body": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal Federal agency responsible for measuring labor market activity, working conditions, and price changes in the economy.Bill Clark | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was canceling the release of the October consumer price index, leaving the Federal Reserve without a key piece of inflation data to ponder when it next decides on interest rates on Dec. 10.The CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Nov. 7, was canceled because the government shutdown made it impossible for the BLS to \"retroactively collect\" certain parts of survey data, the agency said on its website.November's CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Dec. 10, will now be released on Dec. 18 after the Fed decision, the BLS said.Bureau data collectors compile the index through several methods, including personal visits and phone calls that were not possible during the shutdown. The BLS also uses online data and household surveys that also would make it difficult to retroactively collect information. In addition to the Fed announcement, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said another key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, \"is to be rescheduled\" though no firm date has been announced. The Fed uses the PCE price index as its main inflation forecasting tool. The gauge had been set for release Nov. 26.Fed officials have voiced concerns about being in a data fog as they try to formulate monetary policy. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter percentage point rate cut in late October, but minutes from the meeting reflected worries over getting an incomplete picture.\"This is a temporary state of affairs. And we're going to do our jobs, we're going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it, and think carefully about it,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the October meeting. \"What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down. ... There's a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving.\"However, New York Fed President John Williams said Friday he thinks the Fed probably has \"room for a further adjustment in the near term,\" implying the likelihood of a cut sometime soon.Other Fed officials, such as Governor Christopher Waller, have said policymakers still have enough information to make informed decisions, even with the data drought from the shutdown.",

    "body": "John Williams, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during an Economic Club of New York (ECNY) event in New York, US, on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.David Dee Delgado | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCommunication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.Messages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.That's why a speech Friday from the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed's leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.So when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a \"further adjustment in the near term\" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\"There is some ambiguity in the phrase 'near term' – but its most obvious reading is at the next meeting,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note. \"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other members of the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell's sign-off,\" he added.Williams' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.The policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself suddenly divided. On one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.While Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.That's particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over Fed monetary policy.Stocks rallied Friday, with futures turning around after Williams' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.Williams likely saved the market Friday from a potential sell-off that appeared to be taking shape, with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming Friday. Major averages vacillated through the morning but were at session highs heading into afternoon trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 5 days\"Williams intervention came after several other Fed speakers indicated reservations about [December] but drew back from categorical statements, perhaps indicating they recognize the [December] struggle was turning into a crisis of governance at the Fed and see the need to give Powell space to make the call,\" Guha said. To be sure, other speakers weren't as enthusiastic as Williams.Regional Fed Presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Lorie Logan of Dallas both voiced hesitation about further cuts. In a CNBC interview, Collins expressed concern about inflation. Logan was even more hawkish, saying she wasn't even sure she would have voted for the previous two cuts. Collins votes this year on the FOMC, while Logan gets to vote in 2026.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump offered praise for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday after the two men met for the first time at the White House to discuss the growing issue of affordability.While the Republican president and the Democratic mayor-elect have hurled searing attacks at each other in the recent past, they repeatedly shrugged off those words while appearing side by side in the Oval Office. At one point, when Mamdani was asked for the second time about having called Trump a \"fascist,\" the president gave him cover.\"That's OK, you can just say yes,\" Trump said after Mamdani began to respond. \"It's easier than explaining it.\"Trump also appeared to backtrack on his prior threat to withhold federal funding for New York City if Mamdani became its mayor. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Trump said.Instead of rehashing their feud, they talked up their areas of agreement on broad issues, especially focusing on lowering the cost of living.But they also found common ground on some more specific matters, such as getting NYC-based energy giant Con Edison to lower prices. \"We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison, and we're going to have to talk to them ... to start lowering the rates,\" Trump said. \"Absolutely,\" Mamdani added.U.S. President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media as they meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 21, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersTrump gave more praise than Mamdani returned, but the two did trade some compliments.\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"\"I appreciated the meeting with the president,\" said Mamdani, who stood while Trump sat at the Resolute Desk. \"And as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.\"The conciliatory tone was brand new. Mamdani had laced into the president on the campaign trail and in his electoral victory speech, saying, \"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.\"And just two days earlier, Trump had called Mamdani the \"Communist Mayor of New York City.\" The mayor-elect is a self-described democratic socialist who denies being a communist.The Oval Office meeting was requested by Mamdani, the 34-year-old whose stunning triumph in the mayoral race over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has put him at the center of American politics.\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight-and-a-half million people who call the city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.Mamdani and other Democrats who won a bevy of elections this month had focused relentlessly on affordability — a word that Trump has chafed at, while insisting that prices are broadly down already.Meanwhile, the president's approval ratings have fallen precipitously in numerous polls, with respondents consistently pointing to the high cost of living as a main concern.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.     ",

    "body": "An operator for Baker Hughes conducts a wireline survey on a Chesapeake Energy natural gas rig in the North Texas Barnett Shale near Burleson, Texas.Matt Nager | Getty ImagesCompany: Baker Hughes (BKR)Business: Baker Hughes is an energy technology company with a portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. The company operates in two segments: oilfield services and equipment and industrial and energy technology. The OFSE segment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: well construction; completions, intervention and seasurements; production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems. The IET segment provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors.Stock Market Value: $47.84 billion ($48.48 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to resort to a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital announced that they have taken a position in Baker Hughes and are calling on the company to spin out its oilfield services and equipment business, arguing such a step could help push up the stock price by at least 60%.Behind the scenesBaker Hughes is a leading provider of energy and industrial technology services. The company was formed through the 2017 merger of legacy Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, combining best-in-class intellectual property shared by GE spinoff assets and the technical expertise from both organizations. The company operates through two primary segments: industrial and energy technologies and oilfield services and Equipment. The IET unit (55% of projected 2025 revenue and 60% of projected 2025 EBITDA) is a long-cycle industrial and energy business focused on gas technology equipment, including turbines and compressors, and aftermarket services, including new energy applications. The OFSE unit (45%/40%) is a short-cycle oilfield equipment and production services business with an end-to-end portfolio of oilfield services and equipment for well construction and production.Management has built up a strong track record of effective execution, and that success has been reflected in the share price, with the company delivering strong returns of 28.26%, 75.29% and 232.98% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Within IET, the company has taken advantage of its leading position in LNG, in which Baker now has 95% global footprint for the turbomachinery required in plant construction, a market that is expected to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2030. Additionally, the company has a strong position in power generation, as Baker is one of few original equipment manufacturers supplying smaller-scale turbines and complete behind-the-meter power solutions. These offerings have allowed the company to play a pivotal role in helping to address rapidly growing data center demand, as its data center orders have gone from $0 to $550 million in just two quarters. As such, management is heavily investing in this opportunity — developing larger-scale power systems to support mega-data center deployments. Furthermore, Baker's pending acquisition of Chart Industries is expected to further strengthen IET's position in power, LNG, and industrials. As a result, IET is approaching a 20% EBITDA margin, with further margin expansion expected as the business mix continues to shift toward aftermarket services, which generate long-term recurring revenue streams supported by contracts exceeding 10 years and margins of 35% or more. For OFSE, management has taken steps to meaningfully improve the segment's earnings mix and reduce its cyclical commodity exposure. This includes exiting or downsizing non-core ventures and low-margin product lines, such as its surface pressure control joint venture with Cactus; prioritizing the Middle East and international markets (now 75% of OFSE revenue), which are less correlated to commodity prices; and implementing strong pricing discipline and cost cutting measures by enforcing minimum margin thresholds on new contracts, consolidating product lines and simplifying reporting. However, despite these efforts, OFSE remains highly subject to commodity volatility, affecting both the segment's performance and the company's overall valuation. Currently valued at about 9x EBITDA, Baker trades more closely with oilfield services peers (6–7x EBITDA), than its industrial and energy technology peers (16–18x), despite IET being the majority of the company's revenue and EBITDA. An implied sum-of-the-parts multiple for Baker would put the company at approximately 13x. It is for this reason that Ananym has launched a campaign at Baker calling for the company to either continue growing IET relative to OFSE or to pursue a sale or spin of OFSE. Ananym believes that a potential separation could result in an about 51% immediate upside through realizing Baker's sum of parts valuation, even when assuming $100 million dis-synergies from separation. Moreover, this upside does not reflect much of the potential long-term growth tailwinds and margin expansion expected from these ongoing operational initiatives — value drivers that shareholders should also be better positioned to realize through such a move.Founded in September 2024, this is Ananym's third public activist campaign. Knowing Charlie Penner and Alex Silver as we do, we would expect them to strive to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders. As such, they have already expressed full confidence in management to choose the optimal path forward, and the company's strong operational track record fully supports that confidence. Moreover, on Oct. 6, the company announced a review of its capital allocation, business, cost structure, and operations. With all signs pointing towards alignment between the two parties, we do not expect that they will insist on, or even ask for, board representation or continue to engage in much more of a public campaign. Rather, we expect them to work amicably with Baker behind the scenes to unlock meaningful shareholder value. However, this cooperative approach should not be confused for weakness, as they are fiduciaries to their own investors and will do whatever is necessary to create value at their portfolio companies. Thus, should management fail to act decisively, Ananym could quickly shift to a more assertive stance.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "An airplane takes off from New York's Laguardia Airport after the FAA ordered flight cuts at 40 major airports amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., November 7, 2025. Ryan Murphy | ReutersAir traffic controllers and technicians with perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses, the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration said this week.The bonuses will go to 776 controllers and technicians, who will receive notification next week with payments going out by Dec. 9, the FAA and DOT said. There are about 11,000 fully certified air traffic controllers in the U.S., according to their union.\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a release late Thursday.The DOT and FAA didn't immediately say whether preplanned vacation time or fatigue calls would disqualify controllers and technicians from the bonus.An increase in absences of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular paychecks during the more than 40-day shutdown, the longest ever, forced airlines to slow or cancel flights. The shutdown ended Nov. 12 with a bill to fund the government through January.The shutdown's disruptions and additional strain on air traffic controllers, many of whom are already required to work six-day weeks, sparked an outcry from the aviation industry, which urged lawmakers to ensure critical workers aren't left without pay if there's another shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

    "body": "Startup Figure AI is developing general-purpose humanoid robots.Figure AIFigure AI, an Nvidia-backed developer of humanoid robots, was sued by the startup's former head of product safety who alleged that he was wrongfully terminated after warning top executives that the company's robots \"were powerful enough to fracture a human skull.\"Robert Gruendel, a principal robotic safety engineer, is the plaintiff in the suit filed Friday in a federal court in the Northern District of California. Gruendel's attorneys describe their client as a whistleblower who was fired in September, days after lodging his \"most direct and documented safety complaints.\"The suit lands two months after Figure was valued at $39 billion in a funding round led by Parkway Venture Capital. That's a 15-fold increase in valuation from early 2024, when the company raised a round from investors including Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and Microsoft.In the complaint, Gruendel's lawyers say the plaintiff warned Figure CEO Brett Adcock and Kyle Edelberg, chief engineer, about the robot's lethal capabilities, and said one \"had already carved a ¼-inch gash into a steel refrigerator door during a malfunction.\"The complaint also says Gruendel warned company leaders not to \"downgrade\" a \"safety road map\" that he had been asked to present to two prospective investors who ended up funding the company.Gruendel worried that a \"product safety plan which contributed to their decision to invest\" had been \"gutted\" the same month Figure closed the investment round, a move that \"could be interpreted as fraudulent,\" the suit says. The plaintiff's concerns were \"treated as obstacles, not obligations,\" and the company cited a \"vague 'change in business direction' as the pretext\" for his termination, according to the suit.Gruendel is seeking economic, compensatory and punitive damages and demanding a jury trial.A Figure spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Gruendel was \"terminated for poor performance,\" and that his \"allegations are falsehoods that Figure will thoroughly discredit in court.\"Robert Ottinger, Gruendel's attorney, told CNBC in a statement that, \"California law protects employees who report unsafe practices.\" \"This case involves important and emerging issues, and may be among the first whistleblower cases related to the safety of humanoid robots,\" Ottinger said. \"Mr. Gruendel looks forward to the judicial process exposing the clear danger this rush to market approach presents to the public.\"The humanoid robot market remains nascent today, with companies like Tesla and Boston Dynamics pursuing futuristic offerings, alongside Figure, while China's Unitree Robotics is preparing for an IPO. Morgan Stanley said in a report in May that adoption is \"likely to accelerate in the 2030s\" and could top $5 trillion by 2050.Read the filing here:watch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the McDonald's Impact Summit at the Westin Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 17, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is \"laying siege on the minimum wage.\" Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass.Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. \"I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted,\" said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. \"If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages.\" California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot.For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it. A scramble for franchiseesA McDonald's worker prepares to deliver an order at a McDonald's restaurant on May 8, 2024 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesBroadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending.\"What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now,\" said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter.\"For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money,\" said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation.Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food \"unaffordable for many.\"Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said.To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers.\"The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it,\" he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. \"Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified,\" Harper-Howie said. \"That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers.\"Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's.But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said.For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are \"significantly more profitable\" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity.Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves.Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.A lifeline for workersAn employee hands items to a customer at the drive-thru of a Jack in the Box restaurant in Los Angeles, California, US, on Monday, April 1, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the mandated pay hike brings another challenge for restaurant operators, workers see it as a win, even if it means fewer scheduled hours.For Zane Marte, 28, the pay bump meant that he could offer more support to his family and buy some of his own groceries, rather than leaning on his parents.Marte worked for Jack in the Box in the San Jose area for seven years. When he started, he earned $12 an hour. Over time, his pay crept up, lifted by raises and eventually a promotion to a management position. Still, until the $20 fast-food wage went into effect, his hourly pay was still several dollars below the new pay floor. His experience aligns with research from the University of California Berkeley's Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy found that the average pre-policy wage for fast-food workers in California was $17.13 an hour, suggesting that the average hourly pay hike after the $20 minimum took effect was about 17%. A separate report from the University of Kentucky published in April found that hiring for fast-food jobs fell after the new pay floor was implemented. However, turnover shrank as the higher wages encouraged workers to stick around. That decline in turnover offset a slowdown in hiring for fast-food workers in California, according to the report.Historically, turnover has been a major problem for the fast-food industry. Hiring and training new workers is expensive and time consuming for operators. For his part, Marte left Jack in the Box months after receiving the raise after he said he grew \"fed up\" with his manager. He has since left California and found employment using his college degree.Before the higher minimum wage went into effect, one concern from operators and trade groups was that other restaurants not included in the policy would have to raise their own wages to stay competitive — which critics said could be particularly hard for small businesses. But that fear largely doesn't seem to have been realized.The Berkeley study did not find any evidence of a spillover into the wages of workers at full-service restaurants chains such as Denny's, Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin and Outback Steakhouse. And more broadly, the researchers from the University of Kentucky did not find evidence that other non-food, low-wage employers raised their pay. The slowdown in fast-food hiring meant that other employers didn't have to worry much about their workers leaving for those jobs. Research from the Shift Project, a partnership between Harvard and the University of California San Francisco, found that the wage hike did not result in employers cutting scheduled hours or lead to understaffing in the immediate aftermath of the policy. Anecdotally, however, some fast-food restaurants have cut back their hours. For example, Julia Gonzalez, 21, lives in Los Angeles and works at Pizza Hut and Yoshinoya, a Japanese fast-food chain with roughly 100 locations in California. She told CNBC that she's been scheduled for fewer hours, but the increased wages still mean that she's able to save more money. (Gonzalez is affiliated with the California Fast Food Workers Union, which was a proponent of the industry's higher minimum wage.)Harper-Howie also told CNBC that her restaurants cut the number of overall labor hours because of slumping sales, as higher menu prices scared away diners.Meanwhile, the number of fast-food job losses caused by the policy is still hotly debated.Analysis of BLS data by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes minimum wage hikes, found that roughly 16,000 fast-food jobs in California have been eliminated since Newsom signed the law in September 2024. However, Reich and Sosinskiy reported no related job losses using employment data that was adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, citing California's more temperate climate than the rest of the country.For his part, Newsom, widely believed to be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election, still includes it in lists of his policy wins as California governor.\"After raising the minimum wage for workers, California now has 750,500 fast food jobs — the MOST in state history! California's fast food industry continues to boom every single month with workers finally receiving the wages they deserve,\" he wrote in a post on X in August last year.",

    "description": "watch nowParamount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first",
    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first-round offers, according to people familiar with the matter. Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, bid solely for the film and streaming assets, which consists of the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max, the people said. The offer would see NBCUniversal become the parent of the WBD assets, one of the people said, and would not involve a spinout of NBCUniversal as some in the industry had speculated. Comcast is currently in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, which includes CNBC, but will retain NBCUniversal. As of January, that business unit will consist only of the broadcast network NBC, streaming service Peacock, Universal film studio and theme parks. Comcast's offer included a clause that would allow WBD to spin out its own cable networks, including CNN and TNT Sports, at any point before the proposed acquisition closes, the person said. Comcast President and soon-to-be co-CEO Mike Cavanagh recently telegraphed in an earnings call that an acquisition of studio and streaming assets would be complementary to NBCUniversal. Cavanagh also said the company believes a deal would be \"viable\" in the context of the current regulatory environment. Like Comcast, Netflix, also bid solely for the film and streaming assets, according to the people familiar. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance once again submitted, its fourth to date. In recent days, Paramount Skydance and its advisors had been weighing whether to submit a higher bid than its previous $23.50-per-share offer that WBD rejected, some of the people said. Netflix's offer was expected to be \"disciplined\" with its bid, one of the people said. Details on the size of all three offers weren't immediately clear. Warner Bros. Discovery alerted the bidders that it had received the offers and would be back in touch with them soon, one of the people said. Representatives for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast declined to comment. Warner Bros. Discovery is aiming to have its sale process wrapped up by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported. Another round of bids is expected to occur in the coming weeks, some of the people said. Last month Warner Bros. Discovery said it was expanding a strategic review of its business to include a potential sale — even as it carries on with a plan to split into two separate entities: Warner Bros., made up of the film studio and streaming platform, and Discovery Global, which would include the company's pay TV networks. While Warner Bros. Discovery's split has been underway, takeover interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance led WBD CEO David Zaslav and top brass to open up to a formal sale process. If an offer for the studio and streaming assets were to be successful, Discovery Global would move forward with its spinout and current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels would become CEO. The Warner Bros. logo is displayed on a water tower at Warner Bros. Studio on September 12, 2025 in Burbank, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesParamount has already sent multiple letters to WBD's board explaining why its offer of $23.50 per share for all of WBD's assets is in the best interest of shareholders and the company itself. WBD's stock gained 1% Friday to close at $23.19 per share. The company's share price has increased more than 20% since announcing it was up for sale in October. Paramount CEO David Ellison recently met with Saudi-backed sovereign funds about financing a potential transaction, although the conversations were only preliminary and Ellison and his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, are prepared to fully finance a transaction, people familiar with the matter said. While Paramount is interested in a deal for the entirety of WBD, the formal sale process has opened up the possibility of a buyer for only part of the legacy media company. — CNBC's David Faber contributed to this report.

    "body": "A worker repairs a power line in Austin, Texas, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2021.Thomas Ryan Allison | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe rapid expansion of data centers in Texas is driving electricity demand higher during the winter, compounding the risk of supply shortfalls that could lead to blackouts during freezing temperatures. The Lone Star state is attracting a huge amount of data center requests, driven by its abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources as well as its business friendly environment. OpenAI, for example, is developing its flagship Stargate campus in Abilene, about 150 miles west of Dallas-Forth Worth. The campus could require up to 1.2 gigawatts of power, the equivalent of a large nuclear plant. The North American Electric Relibaility Corporation warned this week that data centers' round-the-clock energy consumption will make it more difficult to sustain sufficient electricity supply under extreme demand conditions during freezing temperatures like catastropic Winter Storm Uri in 2021. \"Strong load growth from new data centers and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls,\" NERC said of Texas in an analysis published Tuesday. Texas faces elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the state's grid is reliable during normal peak demand, NERC said. During Uri, demand spiked for home heating in response to the freezing temperatures at the same time power plants failed in large numbers due to the same weather. Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 gigawatts of rolling blackouts to prevent the system from collapsing, according to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report. The majority of the power plants went offline ran on natural gas. It was the \"largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history\" resulting 4.5 million people losing power for several days. At least 210 people died during the storm. Most of the fatalities were connected to the outages and included cases of hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and medical conditions exacerbated by freezing termperatures, according to FERC. Data center requests surgeIn the years since Uri, Texas has received a staggering amount of requests from data centers, crypto mining facilities and industrial customers seeking a grid conenction. More than 220 gigawatts of projects have requested connection as of this month, a 170% increase over the 83 gigawatts of project requests back in January, according to data published Wednesday by ERCOT. About 73% of the projects requesting connection are data centers, according to ERCOT. If all of those projects were actually built, they would be equivalent to the average annual power consumption of nearly 154 million homes in Texas, according to a CNBC analysis based on 2024 household electricity data. But the Lone Star state only has a population of about 30 million people.Beth Garza, a former head of ERCOT's watchdog, said she is very skeptical these projects will all get built, describing the scale of the numbers as \"crazy big.\" More than half the projects have not submitted planning studies, according to ERCOT.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, who served as director of ERCOT's Independent Market Monitor from 2014 through 2019. \"There's just so much stuff in the world to make those kinds of numbers work.\" Phantom data centers are showing up in grid connection requests across the U.S. as developers shop the same projects around to mutliple jurisdictions, said John Moura, the director of NERC's reliability assessments. This makes it difficult for utilities to forecast future demand conditions. watch nowReliability at riskThe projects that ERCOT has approved to actually connect to the grid is much smaller at 7.5 gigawatts, but this is still a subsantial amount of new demand. By comparison, the six county region in southeastern Pennsylvania that includes Philadelphia, with a population of 1.7 million people, had a peak demand of about 8.6 gigwatts in 2024, according to the state utility board. Texas' supply and demand balance can become tight during winter and potentially fall into deficit. The state has 92.6 gigawatts of available resources and peak demand in an extreme Uri-like scenario could reach about 85.3 gigawatts, according to NERC. But avalaible power could fall to around 69.7 gigawatts in extreme winter weather, leaving a supply deficit of more than 15 gigawatts. This is due to typical power plant maintainence and forced plant outages as well as reductions in power capacity due to winter conditions.\"What's important to understand is the tightness we're seeing,\" Moura said. NERC's winter assessment only included data center facilities that have reached certain milestones to filter out speculative projects, he said.\"I can't stress enough how much of a monumental change this is for the electric industry,\" Moura said of the data center requests. One solution is for data centers to show flexibility in their electricity consumption to help keep demand and supply in balance during extreme winter scenarios, he said. In the case of Uri, natural gas plants made up 58% of all the unplanned outages in Texas, according to FERC. Freezing tempartures reduced gas production, led to challenges delivering fuel and problems transmitting electricity as power lines fell. Texas has adopted rules to harden natural gas infrastructure for extreme winters in the wake of the storm. When gas plants go out in such a large way, solar and battery storage also face challenges, according to NERC. Peak demand in winter is in the early morning hours when sunlight is lower and batteries may not have had enough time recharge, Moura said. With data centers running around the clock, \"maintaining sufficient battery state of charge will become increasingly challenging for extended periods of high loads, such as a severe multi-day storm like Winter Storm Uri,\" NERC said in its analysis. \"Power shortfalls and rolling outages really could happen in the next few years in certain regions\" of the U.S. as demand from facilities like data centers outstrips supply, said Rob Gramlich, president of power consulting firm Grid Strategies. \"Those are unacceptable to everybody in the United States.\" Garza said she's confident that the reliable demand from data centers will bring new supply. \"Plants love that kind of of opportunity,\" she said. \"My expectation is that then attracts additional private capital investment to meet those supply needs.\"",

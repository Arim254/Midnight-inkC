Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.Trump said he believes China is committing an \"Economically Hostile Act\" by \"purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers.\"Ending business with China on cooking oil and \"other elements of Trade\" are possible forms of \"retribution\" Trump is weighing, he said in a Truth Social post.\"As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don't need to purchase it from China,\" he wrote.The president's latest criticism follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.The S&P 500 stock index fell immediately after Trump's post, ending the trading day in the red after a volatile session.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, D.C., on March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market are a sign that corporate lending standards grew too lax in the past decade-plus.Dimon, the longtime leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, was speaking about the recent collapse of auto parts firm First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor Holdings.\"We've had a credit bull market now for the better part of what, since 2010 or 2012? That's like 14 years,\" Dimon told CNBC on a call with reporters.\"These are early signs there might be some excess out there because of it,\" Dimon said. \"If we ever have a downturn, you're going to see quite a bit more credit issues.\"Dimon used more colorful language about the Tricolor failure later Tuesday.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" Dimon told analyst Mike Mayo during the bank's earnings conference call. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"The pair of bankruptcies have sparked concerns about the hidden risks involved when banks like JPMorgan, Jefferies and Fifth Third provide financing for private companies. In a quarter where JPMorgan handily topped expectations, thanks to booming activity in institutional trading, questions from reporters and analysts around credit losses took center stage.'Not our finest moment'While JPMorgan managed to dodge losses from First Brands, it did lend to Tricolor, causing $170 million in charge-offs in the quarter, said CFO Jeremy Barnum. Charge-offs happen when a bank recognizes it won't get repaid for loans it made.\"It is not our finest moment,\" Dimon said of the Tricolor episode. \"When something like that happens, you could assume that we scour every issue. ... You can never completely avoid these things, but the discipline is to look at it in cold light and go through every single little thing.\"The credit metrics watched by JPMorgan, including early stage delinquencies, are stable and actually better than expected, Barnum said. The company is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness that could flow into consumer credit, which hasn't happened yet, he said.The automotive company failures, which came amid pressure on international supply chains due in part to President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, have ensnared a constellation of banks.This month, the investment bank Jefferies said that funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies that bought First Brand inventory, while UBS said that its funds had about $500 million in exposure.Last month, regional bank Fifth Third disclosed that it expected up to $200 million in impairments from alleged fraudulent activity at a borrower; the client was Tricolor, Bloomberg reported.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday.\"A lot depends on what the Chinese do,\" Greer told CNBC in an interview. \"They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation.\"China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented.Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week,  saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.\"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains,\" the U.S. trade representative said.Trump, Xi scheduled to meetThe restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.\"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese,\" Greer said of the meeting. \"But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can.\"U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.\"We think we'll be able to work through it,\" Greer said of the trade dispute.'We want to work with the Chinese'The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.\"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information,\" Greer said. \"You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese.\"Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

Violeta Santos Moura | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of trying to weaken the global economy by slapping export controls on resources vital for technology.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent said the moves over rare earths and minerals are an attempt by China \"to pull everyone else down with them.\"\"If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most,\" he said.The move by China comes just ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. In an Oct. 9 announcement Beijing said it won't allow the export of rare earths materials for military use, the first time it has targeted that specific use. The U.S. uses rare earths magnets for many of its most important weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Tomahawk missiles and smart bombs.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 and has threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi. Markets have been volatile since the dispute escalated, with Wall Street stock averages down sharply to start the day Tuesday.\"They are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they're exacerbating their standing in the world,\" Bessent told the FT.",

The companies said more markets outside of the U.S. are in the pipeline.\"This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\" Spotify's Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller said in a statement. \"Together with Netflix, we're expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences, and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.\"Lauren Smith, Netflix's vice president of content licensing and programming strategy, said the curated selection \"adds fresh voices and new perspectives to Netflix.\"The shows coming to Netflix include \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables\" and \"Serial Killers,\" with more expected after the initial launch.Spotify said the move is the next step in evolving the company into a multimedia experience, with more initiatives planned in the future to \"bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators.\"Tuesday's announcement comes as media companies have turned to video podcasts as the next big thing among their audiences. In particular, video podcasts have soared in popularity on Google's YouTube, which is increasingly nabbing a bigger share of viewership.This has led traditional media and streaming companies to lean into the medium.At this year's Upfront advertising presentations, some companies, including Amazon's Prime Video, noted the recent success of podcast content as creators sign multimillion dollar deals and garner millions of followers and views.On an April earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is \"constantly looking at all different types of content.\" Sarandos added that the line between podcasts and talk shows is becoming increasingly blurred. \"We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love,\" Sarandos said. \"Podcasts ... have become a lot more video-forward.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, but gave no long-run indication of where interest rates are heading.Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with \"quantitative tightening,\" or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet.While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications the Fed is nearing its goal of \"ample\" reserves available for banks.\"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,\" Powell said in prepared remarks. \"We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.\"Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets.When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for \"abundant\" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for \"ample\" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system.During the Covid pandemic, the central bank had aggressively purchased Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the balance sheet to close to $9 trillion.Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. The question had been how far the Fed needed to go, and Powell's comments indicate that the end is close.He noted that \"some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening\" and could be signaling that reducing reserves further would hinder growth. However, he also said the Fed has no plans to go back to its pre-Covid balance sheet size, which was closer to $4 trillion.On a related matter, Powell noted concerns over the Fed continuing to pay interest on bank reserves.The Fed normally remits interest it earns from its holdings to the Treasury general fund. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have suggested terminating the payments on reserves.However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy.\"While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history,\" he said. \"If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates.\"Views on the economyOn the larger issue of interest rates, Powell generally stuck to the recent script, namely that policymakers are concerned that the labor market is tightening and skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation.\"While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation,\" he said. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\"Powell noted that the Federal Open Market Committee responded in September to the situation with a quarter percentage point reduction on the federal funds rate. While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal.\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" he said.The Fed has been hampered somewhat by the government shutdown and the impact it has had on economic data releases. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions.Powell said the Fed is continuing to analyze conditions based on the data that is available.\"Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,\" Powell said. \"Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week.Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.",

Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmericans have vastly different views of the economy — and the divergence is being driven in part by income bracket, data shows.Higher-income consumers were more likely to report stronger economic confidence readings when asked to look over the next year given changes that have come since the presidential election, according to JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey.This release adds to a growing body of qualitative and quantitative evidence showing the U.S. economy is in a \"K-shape,\" a term used by economists to describe the deviation in economic experiences by income. In other words, it can explain why well-off Americans are continuing to spend while lower earners buckle under inflationary pressures.\"Survey results indicated a notable bifurcation,\" JPMorgan's Matthew Boss, a widely followed and respected consumer analyst, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10, underscoring their rosy financial outlooks.On the other hand, low income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Less than a quarter of participants in this category provided a score between 7 and 10, which Boss pointed out creates a 30-point delta between these groups.Across income brackets, the average respondent rated their confidence at a 4.9 out of 10 rating.This income-based division was once again prevalent when consumers were asked about their confidence for covering monthly bills compared with six to 12 months ago.Nearly six out of 10 high-income consumers said covering these bills were or becoming easier to cover. But just 37% and 30% of middle- and lower-income groups, respectively, said the same.Higher-income respondents were also more likely to say they were planning to increase spending on non-essential items over the next year than other brackets, according to JPMorgan's survey.JPMorgan isn't the only organization seeing a disparity between income classes when it comes to their economic outlooks.The top third of earners have reported an average consumer sentiment rating that's around 25% higher than the lowest third over the last two years, according to the University of Michigan.",

    "body": "2026 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepDETROIT – Jeep is overhauling its top-end Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year under a yearslong turnaround plan for the quintessential American SUV brand.The changes include updating exterior styling, introducing a new forthcoming extended-range powertrain and creating a simplified, less expensive model lineup all under the \"Grand Wagoneer\" name. Jeep will also kill off the standalone \"Wagoneer\" nameplate.\"This marks a significant portfolio moment in refining our flagship SUV to reach a broader audience,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said during a media event.Since launching in 2021, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer have not lived up to expectations. Initial production of the vehicles was riddled with problems and the dual nameplates for the same-looking vehicles confused consumers.2022 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepThe initial pricing for those vehicles also could top $111,000 — which had been unexplored territory for the brand known for rugged SUVs — and they featured a host of tiered trim levels that complicated ordering.\"We confused our buyers. We confused our dealers,\" Broderdorf said. \"I'm here to tell you we got the message. We're fixing it.\"The 2026 Grand Wagoneer will start under $65,000, including mandatory destination charges. That is similar to where the Wagoneer currently starts in pricing, but Jeep said it includes additional features and is more in line with competitors' pricing.\"I'm here to win,\" Broderdorf said. \"I want to come out very, very fast and see what we can do to really gain some share and continue to grow the brand … that was the mission for me.\"2026 Jeep Grand Wagoneer JeepJeep, owned by French-Italian-American automaker Stellantis, said it expects to the Grand Wagoneer to be the first SUV with a plug-in technology known as a range-extender, or EREV. It can operate as a zero-emissions EV until its battery dies and an electric onboard generator — powered by a 27-gallon, 3.6-liter V6 engine — kicks on to power the vehicle.Stellantis' Ram Trucks brand was expected to be the first to launch an EREV model, but after several delays and the brand conducting its own turnaround plan, the Jeep model is expected to be the first EREV available beginning next year.Jeep is one of the most crucial of Stellantis' 14 brands — if not the most important in North America. The revamped Grand Wagoneer is the second of four major product announcements that began this summer with the reveal of its new Jeep Cherokee SUV.The turnaround plan also has included reworking pricing of Jeep SUVs, which inflated in recent years above market norms, and re-engaging with its alienated dealer network amid a lack of new products and declining sales.So far, Jeep's U.S. sales are moving in the right direction. The brand is on track to report its first year-over-year sales gain since 2018, when it recorded all-time high sales of more than 973,000 vehicles. That compares to 587,725 units sold last year, a 40% drop from Jeep's sales peak.\"Quite frankly, my only interest is growing this brand and doing so in a very fun, historical Jeep way,\" said Broderdorf, who succeeded now-Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in leading Jeep in February.",

Kent Nishimura | Getty ImagesMajor U.S. airports from New York to Washington state are refusing to air a video showing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats in Congress for the ongoing federal government shutdown.Some of those airports cited the political nature of Noem's message for not showing the video, saying that it violated their policies.The Transportation Security Administration sent requests to airports nationwide to air the video on screens near passenger screening lines.Noem, in the video, says, \"It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,\" according to MSNBC.\"However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,\" says Noem, whose department oversees the TSA.Noem's message is consistent with comments by President Donald Trump and other top administration officials, who since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 have blamed congressional Democrats for not joining Republicans to pass a stopgap funding bill to resume normal government operations.Democrats refuse to budge on their demand that any funding deal extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of this year. Republicans, in turn, refuse to include that provision.Air traffic controllers resume operations a day after Hollywood Burbank Airport operated for hours without a staffed control tower due to staffing shortages amid the U.S. government shutdown, in Burbank, California, U.S., Oct. 7, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersThe airports that refused to show Noem's video include the three major airports in the New York City area: John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in Queens, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.\"The Port Authority's longstanding policies prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities, so airports are not airing the video on airport-controlled screens,\" said a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates those three airports.The Chicago Department of Aviation, which operates O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway International Airport, also declined DHS's request.\"Advertising at Chicago's airports, including promotional materials and public service announcements, must comply with CDA's Advertising Guidelines, which prohibit content that endorses or opposes any named political party,\" the department said in an email. \"These guidelines help ensure the airports remain welcoming and neutral spaces for all travelers.\"Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Portland International Airport in Oregon also refused to show the video.The Portland airport \"did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,\" Molly Prescott, aviation communications manager for the Port of Portland, which operates the airport, told CNBC by email.The Hatch Act prohibits certain political activities by federal government employees and aims to protect federal employees from political coercion at work.\"Additionally, Oregon law states no public employee can promote or oppose any political committee, party, or affiliation,\" Prescott said. \" We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law.\"A spokesperson for Charlotte Douglas International Airport said that showing the video would violate local laws and airport policies.\"Additionally, TSA does not own any monitors at the airport's checkpoints,\" the Charlotte airport spokesperson said. \"The limited digital screens owned by CLT are designated for static content that supports wayfinding, provides essential travel information and promotes CLT's revenue-generating services.\"Spokespeople for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas said those facilities declined to post the video because of policies barring political content.A spokesperson for the Las Vegas airport said that \"as a facility that hosts federal operations, we remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions on political activity in government workplaces.\"Cleveland Hopkins International Airport has reportedly refused to show Noem's video.CNBC reached out to various airports across the U.S. seeking comment on whether they are airing the video.A representative for the Detroit Metro Airport said that Noem's video is being shown on monitors in TSA-leased areas. A spokesperson for Austin–Bergstrom International Airport said the TSA checkpoints at the airport are not equipped with video monitors, so they are unable to show any video or digital content.In a statement to CNBC, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, reiterated comments that Noem made on the video.\"While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time,\" McLaughlin added. \"It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,\" she said.\"Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.\"A shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown has caused flight delays and disruptions, CNBC reported last week.On Friday, airlines told travelers to brace for delays over the Columbus Day holiday weekend due to staffing shortages.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesLast week, air traffic controller shortages contributed to delays at airports including Burbank, California, and Nashville, Tennessee.Air travel was snarled during the more than month-long government shutdown that ended in January 2019, hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights in the New York area.Before that, some airport security checkpoints were closed due to elevated sick calls from Transportation Security Administration screeners who are also working without pay.On Tuesday, air traffic controllers received their first partial paycheck.

    "body": "A Chevrolet Silverado EV and a Chevrolet Brightdrop, which is assembled in Canada, are seen on display at the Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February 13, 2025. Carlos Osorio | ReutersDETROIT — General Motors' third-quarter results next week will include a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated. The Detroit automaker Tuesday morning in a public filing said $1.2 billion of the impact will be noncash, special charges as a result of adjustments to its EV capacity. The other $400 million in cash is primarily related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments, according to the filing. The automaker said its reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint is \"ongoing,\" signaling additional charges could be announced for future quarters.The charges will be reported as special items when GM announces its third-quarter results on Oct. 21. That means they will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings, or EBIT-adjusted, which are closely watched by Wall Street.GM was among the earliest to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that didn't culminate. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion by this year in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.The charges come amid changing regulations regarding EVs — particularly the end of $7,500 in federal tax credits — under the Trump administration as compared with President Joe Biden, who championed the vehicles. watch now\"Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,\" GM said in the filing.John Murphy, a longtime analyst with Bank of America, warned earlier this year of such write-downs for automakers that invested heavily in EVs.\"There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,\" Murphy, who's now with Haig Partners, said in June during an event for Bank of America's \"Car Wars\" report. \"Based on the study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.\"GM's EV pullback charges come more than a year after crosstown rival Ford Motor announced a $1.9 billion impact from its EV plans. Ford's included about $400 million for the write-down of manufacturing assets, as well as additional expenses and cash expenditures of up to $1.5 billion that included canceling a large, electric three-row SUV that was already far in development and delaying production of its next-generation electric full-size pickup truck.GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year in EV sales, but the size of the market is niche compared with expectations at the beginning of this decade.Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share in all-electric vehicles to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. It still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla, which was estimated to have a 43.1% market share through September.",

    "body": "watch nowSam Altman didn't set out to compete with Nvidia. OpenAI began with a simple bet that better ideas, not better infrastructure, would unlock artificial general intelligence. But that view shifted years ago, as Altman realized that more compute, or processing power, meant more capability — and ultimately, more dominance. On Monday morning, he unveiled his latest blockbuster deal, one that moves OpenAI squarely into the chipmaking business and further into competition with the hyperscalers.OpenAI is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop racks of custom AI accelerators, purpose-built for its own models. It's a big shift for a company that once believed intelligence would come from smarter algorithms, not bigger machines.\"In 2017, the thing that we found was that we were getting the best results out of scale,\" the OpenAI CEO said in a company podcast on Monday. \"It wasn't something we set out to prove. It was something we really discovered empirically because of everything else that didn't work nearly as well.\"That insight — that the key was scale, not cleverness — fundamentally reshaped OpenAI. Now, the company is expanding that logic even further, teaming up with Broadcom to design and deploy racks of custom silicon optimized for OpenAI's workloads.The deal gives OpenAI deeper control over its stack, from training frontier models to owning the infrastructure, distribution, and developer ecosystem that turns those models into lasting platforms.Altman's rapid series of deals and product launches is assembling a complete AI ecosystem, much like Apple did for smartphones and Microsoft did for PCs, with infrastructure, hardware, and developers at its core.watch nowHardwareThrough its partnership with Broadcom, OpenAI is co-developing custom AI accelerators, optimized for inference and tailored specifically to its own models.Unlike Nvidia and AMD chips, which are designed for broader commercial use, the new silicon is built for vertically integrated systems, tightly coupling compute, memory, and networking into full rack-level infrastructure. OpenAI plans to begin deploying them in late 2026.The Broadcom deal is similar to what Apple did with its M-series chips: control the semiconductors, control the experience.But OpenAI is going even further and engineering every layer of the hardware stack, not just the chip.The Broadcom systems are built on its Ethernet stack and designed to accelerate OpenAI's core workloads, giving the company a physical advantage that's deeply entangled with its software edge.At the same time, OpenAI is pushing into consumer hardware, a rare move for a model-first company.Its $6.4 billion all-stock acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, brought the legendary Apple designer into its inner circle. It was a sign that OpenAI doesn't just want to power AI experiences, it wants to own them.Ive and his team are exploring a new class of AI-native devices designed to reshape how people interact with intelligence, moving beyond screens and keyboards toward more intuitive, engaging experiences.Reports of early concepts include a screenless, wearable device that uses voice input and subtle haptics, envisioned more as an ambient companion than a traditional gadget.OpenAI's twin bet on custom silicon and emotionally resonant consumer hardware adds two more powerful branches over which it has direct control.watch nowBlockbuster dealsOpenAI's chips, datacenters and power fold into one coordinated campaign called Stargate that provides the physical backbone of AI.In the past three weeks, that campaign has gone into overdrive with several major deals:OpenAI and Nvidia have agreed to a framework for deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, backed by a proposed $100 billion investment.AMD will supply OpenAI with multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs under a 6-gigawatt deal. OpenAI can acquire up to 10% of AMD if certain deployment milestones are met.Broadcom's custom inference chips and racks are slated to begin deployment in late 2026, as part of Stargate's first 10‑gigawatt phase.Taken together, it is OpenAI's push to root the future of AI in infrastructure it can call its own.\"We are able to think from etching the transistors all the way up to the token that comes out when you ask ChatGPT a question, and design the whole system,\" Altman said. \"We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that.\"Whether or not OpenAI can deliver on every promise, the scale and speed of Stargate is already reshaping the market, adding hundreds of billions in market cap for its partners, and establishing OpenAI as the de facto market leader in AI infrastructure.None of its rivals appears able to match the pace or ambition. And that perception alone is proving a powerful advantage.DevelopersOpenAI's DevDay made it clear that the company isn't just focused on building the best models — it's betting on the people who build with them.\"OpenAI is trying to compete on several fronts,\" said Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at D.A. Davidson, pointing to its frontier model, consumer-facing chat product, and enterprise API platform. \"It is competing with some combination of all the large technology companies in one or more of these markets.\"Developer Day, he said, was aimed at helping companies incorporate OpenAI models into their own tools.\"The tools they presented were very impressive — OpenAI has been terrific at commercializing their products in a compelling and easy-to-use manner,\" he added. \"Having said that, they are fighting an uphill battle, since the companies they are competing with have significantly more resources — at least for now.\"The main competition, Luria said, is primarily Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud.Developer Day signaled just how aggressively OpenAI is leaning in.The company rolled out AgentKit for developers, new API bundles for enterprise, and a new App Store that offers direct distribution inside ChatGPT — which now reaches 800 million weekly active users, according to OpenAI.\"It's the Apple playbook: own the ecosystem and become a platform,\" said Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.watch nowUntil now, most companies treated OpenAI as a tool in their stack. But with new features for publishing, monetizing, and deploying apps directly inside ChatGPT, OpenAI is pushing for tighter integration — and making it harder for developers to walk away.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pursued a similar strategy after taking over from Steve Ballmer.To build trust with developers, Nadella leaned into open source and acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, a move that signaled Microsoft's return to the developer community.GitHub later became the launchpad for tools like Copilot, anchoring Microsoft back at the center of the modern developer stack.\"OpenAI and all the big hyperscalers are going for vertical integration,\" said Ben van Roo, CEO of Legion, a startup building secure agent frameworks for defense and intelligence use cases.\"Use our models and our compute, and build the next-gen agents and workflows with our tools. The market is massive. We're talking about replaying SaaS, big systems of record, and literally part of the labor force,\" said van Roo.SaaS stands for software as a service, a group of companies specializing in enterprise software and services, of which Salesforce, Oracle and Adobe are part.Legion's strategy is to stay model-agnostic and focus on secure, interoperable agentic workflows that span multiple systems. The company is already deploying inside classified Department of Defense environments and embedding across platforms like NetSuite and Salesforce.But that same shift also introduces risk for the model makers.\"Agents and workflows make some of the massive LLMs both powerful and maybe less necessary,\" he noted. \"You can build reasoning agents with smaller and specific workflows without GPT-5.\"The tools and agents built with leading LLMs have the potential to replace legacy software products from companies like Microsoft and Salesforce.That's why OpenAI is racing to build the infrastructure around its models. It's not just to make them more powerful, but harder to replace.The real bet isn't that the best model will win, but that the company with the most complete developer loop will define the next platform era.And that's the vision for ChatGPT now: Not just a chatbot, but an operating system for AI.watch now",

    "body": "An airplane takes off the control tower at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Oct. 8, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. air traffic controllers have received partial paychecks, their union said Tuesday, and they could miss their next paychecks altogether if the government shutdown lasts another two weeks.\"The job is stressful enough as it is. Now you're adding this factor of, 'Hey, when am I going to get this next paycheck?'\" said Raymond Dahlstrom, an air traffic controller.Dahlstrom and some of his colleagues handed out leaflets outside of LaGuardia Airport in New York on Tuesday to urge the public to ask lawmakers to end the shutdown. Air traffic controllers were also scheduled to hand out informational pamphlets at other airports in Washington, D.C., and Chicago on Tuesday.The government shut down on Oct. 1, as the Senate has failed to pass a bill to fund the government. Air traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the thousands of government employees who are required to work despite not getting paid during the impasse.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsLast week, shortages of air traffic controllers caused delays at airports, including in Nashville, Tennessee, and Burbank, California, though most facilities were sufficiently staffed.\"We're still showing up, nobody is calling out sick … other than they're sick,\" Dahlstrom said. He said some controllers are taking second jobs like driving for ride-hailing companies to help make ends meet while they're going without pay.A more-than-monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Even outside of the shutdown, the U.S. has been dealing with a shortage of trained air traffic controllers, which has periodically disrupted flights. Airline executives have pushed for more training initiatives and more modern technology for years.But the government shutdown has also put additional focus on U.S. aviation.Some airports including Las Vegas, the three major New York City airports and others are refusing to air a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames the shutdown on Democrats, airport officials told CNBC on Tuesday.",

    "body": "There's a sharp divide between what Gen Z values and what hiring managers are actually looking for.My team at Becoming You Labs recently conducted a study using our values-assessment tool, The Values Bridge, which ranks 16 values using 100 behavioral questions. Since May, over 77,000 people have taken it. We then cross-referenced the study with a national survey of 2,100 hiring managers across industries like tech, consulting, banking, and professional services. (Read more about our research here.)The disconnect was clear — and pretty stark: Gen Z's top three values are self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people. The people hiring them, on the other hand, are looking for employees who value achievement, learning, and hard work. When you cross-reference the two studies, only 2% of Gen Z shares their bosses' priorities.In response to the findings, one CEO said: \"This explains exactly why we can't hire.\" A hospital executive put it more bluntly: \"We are now hiring two or three new docs to replace a retiring one. They tell us we should not be expecting them to work hard because life as a cardiologist isn't what it used to be.\"One head of HR summed all the comments up with the line: \"This is crazy. And confirming.\"Gen Z's response? Starkly different. One recent grad on TikTok: \"Why would we want to live by Boomer values when their values ruined the world?\" Another added: \"Old people hate young people because our lives prove theirs were wasted. I'm not going to wish I worked more on my deathbed.\"The intensity of the debate didn't shock me. I've watched this clash build for years — in classrooms and in boardrooms. Companies are frustrated. Young people are frustrated. And looming over it all? AI, threatening to replace the few entry-level jobs Gen Z already struggles to land.Given this context, what's an \"unemployable\" (as one WSJ headline put it) Gen Zer supposed to do? Nobody wants to suppress their values, and that's understandable. But most people can't go without work. Is there a way forward for the 98% of Gen Zers who put self-care, authenticity, and altruism above company success and career propulsion?Here's my advice for the vast majority of Gen Zers stuck in what probably feels like a very untenable place.1. Come to terms with the value you place on wealthWhen I teach my class \"Becoming You\" at NYU Stern School of Business, I don't let students self-report when it comes to their desire for wealth. The reason is simple: People rarely tell the truth about their relationship with money — to themselves and others — because there's thought to be a faint stink off of wanting to be rich.But you cannot make any sustainable career decisions without getting very honest about the number in your head. That is, the amount of money you want and need to feel, \"That's enough.\" It could be \"one good vacation a year,\" as a student once put it, it could be as another admitted, \"one private helicopter per kid.\"My research shows that 42% of Gen Z has affluence in their top five values, 35% consider it a moderate value, and 23% have it in their bottom five values.Once you know where affluence ranks for you, you can make more thoughtful choices about whether to nudge yourself toward the 2% or not. After all, even with self-care as a top value, if wealth is close behind, something has to give. On the other hand, if wealth ranks No. 10 or even No. 16, a whole different world of work enters your realm of possibilities.2. Join or start a company that accommodates your valuesIf you do not want to suppress your values, your best strategy is to find a company that supports the ones you already have.Keep your eyes open for the published lists of businesses that are said to support employee well-being, authenticity, and giving back. Just know that these companies are often magnets for job-seekers. If you end up applying to one, make sure to level up with an excellent cover letter and top-notch resume.Then there's entrepreneurship. As a two-time founder myself, I know how grueling it can be. But if you have the right idea, with market fit and the stamina to match, creating your own workplace culture is the surest way to be able to live by your values.3. Make a decade-long deal with yourselfI rarely suggest people try to change their values. It's like changing your personality; it usually doesn't stick. But if landing a job is an urgent priority, and affluence is a long-range one, you may choose to suppress your desire for wellbeing, balance, and authentic self-expression for a period of time and embrace achievement and workcentrism.In other words, make like the Boomers and say hello to delayed gratification.My word of warning, however, is if you follow this strategy, don't dabble and don't relitigate your decision daily. Instead, commit. And commit for long enough to see results. I recommend a full decade. Overnight success is a myth, even for those in the 2%.How much you live by your values is one of the most personal, consequential choices you'll ever make. That choice can shape your income, your sense of purpose, and the arc of your career. Approach it not with panic or resignation, but with the wisdom of your years — both the ones you've already lived and the many still ahead.Suzy Welch is an award-winning NYU Stern School of Business professor, acclaimed researcher, popular podcaster and three-time NYT best-selling author, most recently with \"Becoming You: A Proven Method for Crafting Your Authentic Life and Career.\" A graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, Dr. Welch is a frequent guest of the Today Show and an op-ed contributor to the Wall Street Journal.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at the White House, following his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 10, 2025. Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has vowed to target only \"Democrat Agencies\" for permanent staffing cuts amid the government shutdown — but the administration's layoffs so far have affected programs and services that cut across party lines.The White House on Friday issued thousands of reduction-in-force notices, known as RIFs.Around 4,200 federal employees from at least eight departments and agencies were affected.The department sustaining the largest cuts was the Treasury Department, where nearly 1,450 staffers received RIF notices.The RIFs there included cutting the entire 83-person staff of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which invests in public-private partnerships to support lower-income communities, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.The CDFI has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress. In March, after Trump signed an executive order targeting the fund for cuts, a group of 23 senators wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to reaffirm \"the critical role it plays in the communities it serves.\"The letter noted that every dollar provided to CDFI \"generates at least eight more dollars from private-sector investment.\" The signatories included a group of Republican senators: Mike Crapo of Idaho, Montana's Tim Sheehy, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mississippi's Cindy Hyde-Smith, and Jim Justice of West Virginia.In late July, a longer list of Republican and Democratic senators urged White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought to swiftly give CDFI the funding that Congress appropriated for it.CDFI employees who received RIF notices on Friday were told that their service would end Dec. 13, the Journal reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesThe second-largest number of RIFs was issued to employees at the Health and Human Services Department, where more than 1,300 employees were reportedly affected.But the terminations of about 700 staffers at DHS, who work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were reportedly reversed the next day.But other fired employees, including those from the CDC's Washington field office, its Injury Center and its Division of Violence Prevention, will not be rehired, The New York Times reported.At the Education Department, 466 employees received RIFs.Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, wrote on social media on Friday that the hundreds of Education Department impacting special education services, school grants and more.\"Special education oversight. Grants to high-need schools. Protection of civil rights. Gone,\" she Pringle wrote. \"This administration is destroying our education system from the inside out.\"The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, where some of the cuts reportedly took place, is among the offices targeted in Project 2025, the right-wing manual for a major government overhaul.Some Republican senators have spoken out against the firings by the Trump administration.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Friday that she \"strongly oppose[s]\" Vought's attempt to permanently lay off furloughed workers, even as she blamed the shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in an X post Friday, \"There is no question this is poorly timed and yet another example of this administration's punitive actions toward the federal workforce.\"\"The termination of federal employees in a shutdown will further hurt hard-working Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service and jeopardize agency missions once we finally re-open the government,\" she wrote.The Trump administration, which blames Democrats for the shutdown that hit Day 14 on Tuesday, has argued that the firings are an unavoidable consequence of the federal funding lapse, though that has not been the case in prior shutdowns.At the same time, Trump has touted the prospect of mass cuts as an \"unprecedented opportunity\" to eliminate parts of the government that his Republican Party dislikes.His administration has already made clear through its Department of Government Efficiency that slashing the federal bureaucracy is a major priority, though that group's cuts have fallen short of its initial goals.The president's latest firing threats are explicitly partisan.On the second day of the shutdown, Trump said he was considering cutting \"Democrat Agencies\" on either a temporary or permanent basis.During a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, he said, \"We're only cutting Democrat programs.\"Democrats will \"get a little taste of their own medicine,\" he added.What that meant was unclear, as federal agencies and programs are not divided by party. Trump, at the meeting, described them as \"very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly.\"",

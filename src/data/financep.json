    "body": "You may have heard of the September Surge. With summer vacations ending, kids back in school, and end-of-year goals coming back into focus, some employers go on a hiring spree. Even in the rockier job market this year, delayed Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, far more than expected. On the other side of the equation, job seekers are often busy applying left and right in September. But around the holidays, many press pause on their job search.\"People assume that companies aren't hiring or that they just stop hiring from Thanksgiving through New Year's, and that is not true,\" Vicki Salemi, career expert at Monster, tells CNBC Make It.\"Some job seekers may say, 'It's Thanksgiving and then the holidays; I'll wait until January,'\" she adds. But \"if the majority of people do that, then you actually have more opportunity to stand out because there's less competition.\"Behind the scenesKarolina Severova, a senior talent acquisition specialist in higher education, says the fourth quarter was always one of her strongest when she was an agency recruiter, filling positions across businesses and industries.\"Some companies have to spend the remainder of their budget, or they will lose it going into next year,\" she says. Teams could be rushing to fill spots that have already been guaranteed for this year, since they don't know what they'll get next year.If an employer has a big project kicking off in the new year or just wants to start the year strong, they might want to onboard talent now so they can hit the ground running in January.A good time to connectThe end of the year can also be fruitful for networking.\"The holidays just present a very natural opening for reconnecting with others,\" career expert Amanda Augustine previously told Make It.Industry or vocational groups often have year-end parties, and the added festivity around the holidays can alleviate some of the usual pressure of networking events.Outside of events, you can send a quick note to check in with people in your network, share an update from your work and life, and wish them happy holidays and a wonderful year ahead; even a short message can help bring you to mind for job openings. Since November and December are slower at work for many people, you may also be able to schedule time to catch up.Of course, there are many reasons people might want to scale back their job search around the holidays. It's often a time for family, celebrations, and rest. Job seekers may also want a break from this tough job market. But if your holdup is that you think hiring has ended for the year, think again. If a team needs to fill a position before the end of the year, Severova says, \"they will make sure to do everything in their power to pursue a new hire.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "TSMC on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against a former senior vice president it accused of leaking \"confidential information\" to Intel.Wei-Jen Lo joined Intel after 21 years at TSMC, having left in July, the Taiwanese chip maker said in a statement, announcing the lawsuit.The lawsuit is based on Lo's employment contract and non-compete agreement with TSMC, and regulations such as the Trade Secrets Act, the statement said. \"There is a high probability that Lo uses, leaks, discloses, delivers, or transfers TSMC's trade secrets and confidential information to Intel,\" it said. TSMC's share price fell on Tuesday and was last seen over 3% lower. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.It follows earlier reports by local media and later by Reuters, which stated Lo may have taken TSMC's technology data to Intel. Taiwan's High Prosecutors opened an investigation into the allegations. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan told Bloomberg News last week that his \"company respects intellectual property rights\" and denied any wrongdoing. The U.S. firm's stock price moved 1.5% lower in mid-morning trade.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump walks as workers react at U.S. Steel Corporation–Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, U.S., May 30, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has appointed two Department of Commerce officials to oversee U.S. Steel under the golden share agreement reached with Japan's Nippon, according to a letter posted Monday in the Federal Register. Trump approved U.S. Steel's controversial acquisition by Nippon in June after securing veto rights over key business decisions under a golden share arrangement. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange that same month after the acquisition was completed. Trump holds the veto powers covered by the golden share as U.S. president, but he can also designate someone else to wield those authorities as his representative if he wants. The president appointed William Kimmitt, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as his designee in a letter to U.S. Steel.\"I, President Donald J. Trump, hold the Class G Preferred Stock (Golden Share) in U.S. Steel, pursuant to the National Security Agreement (Agreement) between the United States Government, Nippon Steel Corporation, and U.S. Steel,\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 letter to U.S. Steel executive Scot Duncan.\"The Golden Share provides the President with the ability to oversee U.S. Steel's activities and to ensure the company continues operating its United States-based production facilities,\" Trump said. The golden share allows Trump or his designee to veto decisions that include changing U.S. Steel's name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh, relocating the company outside the U.S., or closing production facilities.  Trump also appointed David Shapiro, a chief counsel at Commerce, as a director on U.S. Steel's board representing the U.S. government, according to the letter. The golden share goes to future U.S. presidents or their designee after Trump leaves office. ",

    "body": "An Abercrombie & Fitch store stands in midtown Manhattan in New York City on Oct. 24, 2024.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesShares of Abercrombie & Fitch soared 20% in morning trading on Tuesday after the company posted 7% growth in quarterly sales and issued its holiday guidance. Abercrombie, which runs its namesake brand and Hollister, is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to climb between 4% and 6%, which is largely below Wall Street expectations of 5.6% growth, according to LSEG. It anticipates earnings per share will be between $3.40 and $3.70, roughly in line with expectations of $3.55 per share. Abercrombie beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines in the fiscal third quarter. Here's how the apparel retailer did in the period ended Nov. 1 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.36 vs. $2.16 expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.28 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the quarter was $113 million, or $2.36 per share, compared with $131.98 million, or $2.50 per share, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $1.29 billion, up about 7% from $1.21 billion a year earlier.  During the quarter, sales at the Abercrombie brand fell 2% to $617.35 million, well below the $631.8 million analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales declined by a staggering 7%. For at least the third quarter in a row, Hollister saved the retailer, as sales climbed 16% to $673.27 million, well above the $649.7 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales rose 15%.The company's namesake banner has fueled its comeback in recent years, but now that the Abercrombie brand's growth has started to moderate, Hollister has picked up the baton. CEO Fran Horowitz said sales at Abercrombie are expected to be flat in the current quarter, indicating growth at Hollister is set to drive the company's holiday shopping season. Last quarter, Horowitz said the slowdown at Abercrombie was related to old inventory the company needed to mark down to sell. She said she expected the brand to be back to growth by the end of the year, but that no longer seems to be the case. During Abercrombie's conference call, investors will be looking out for details about the company's plan to reignite growth at its namesake brand. ",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025. Alexander Drago | ReutersUkraine has reportedly agreed to the framework of a peace deal brokered by the U.S., which could be a significant first step toward ending the almost four-year war. Ukraine reportedly agreed to an amended peace agreement during talks that U.S. officials held with a Ukrainian delegation in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. A Russian delegation was also in the UAE capital, although it's uncertain whether joint talks were held. Reports of an agreement emerged when an unnamed U.S. official told ABC News that \"minor details\" still need to be resolved but that \"the Ukrainians have agreed to the peace deal.\"\"There are some minor details to be sorted out but they have agreed to a peace deal,\" the U.S. official told the news outlet.A Ukrainian official told Reuters that Ukraine supports the \"essence\" of a peace deal framework following talks in Geneva last weekend. The official, who was not named, added that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump would discuss the \"most sensitive issues\" of the framework.Neither Russia nor Ukraine has publicly commented on the deal, however, and CNBC was unable to confirm the ABC News and Reuters reports. It's uncertain whether Moscow will agree to any amended deal. The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place in Abu Dhabi, with Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov telling reporters, \"we still have nothing to say\" and that the Kremlin was \"monitoring media reports.\"\"We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information. For now, we have no new information.\"Amended plansUkraine has come under sustained pressure in the last week to agree to a peace plan with Russia after it emerged that the U.S. and Moscow had held secret talks and devised a 28-point peace plan that largely favored Moscow's demands.The plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces. The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"While media reports about the \"peace plan\" were initially met with a grim silence by Ukraine's Zelenskyy and his European allies, some analysts said it amounted to a capitulation to Russia's maximalist territorial demands.Meanwhile, Trump issued an ultimatum to Kyiv to respond to the plan by Thursday. Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled his approval of the plan, saying it formed the \"basis of a final peace settlement.\"Breaking his silence on the proposals last Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history and was essentially facing a choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.",

Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesConsumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday.The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2.In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2 while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points.\"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\"A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration.The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no-hire no-fire\" current job climate show in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point.Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers.For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago.The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December.In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups.\"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\"Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year.Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.",

    "body": "A 'Now Hiring' sign sits in the window of a Denny's restaurant on Nov. 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday.Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That's an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago.With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative data like ADP's has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. Government agencies such as the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis have released revised schedules, but critical reports such as the monthly nonfarm payrolls count won't come out until December.Policymakers at the Federal Reserve won't have much of the usual data they use to make forecasts when they meet again Dec. 9-10. However, in recent days, several officials have advocated for additional interest rate cuts, causing the market to recalibrate expectations to now expecting a reduction at next month's meeting.\"With the next jobs report now scheduled for December 16 and CPI for December 18, there is little on the calendar to derail a cut on December 10,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a client note Sunday.When the releases do start rolling out, Hatzius said he expects that \"alternative indicators show renewed job losses in October\" even though the BLS last week reported better-than-expected 119,000 growth in payrolls for September.The Goldman team expects the Fed to react with a cut in December and two more quarter percentage points reductions in 2026.",

    "body": "A Best Buy store in Pinole, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 24, 2025. Best Buy Co. is expected to release earnings figures on November 25. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBest Buy hiked its full-year forecast Tuesday, as it topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations and customers turned to the retailer to upgrade laptops and splurge on new gaming consoles and smartphones. The consumer electronics retailer said it now expects revenue of between $41.65 billion to $41.95 billion for the full year, higher than its previous range of $41.1 billion to $41.9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.35, compared with its prior range of $6.15 to $6.30.Best Buy said it expects full-year comparable sales, a metric that tracks sales online and at stores open at least 14 months, to range between a 0.5% rise to a 1.2% increase, compared with its previous expectations for a 1% decline and a 1% climb.On the company's earnings call, CEO Corie Barry said Best Buy saw \"better-than-expected\" sales in the quarter because of strong results across computing, gaming and mobile phones, as well as growth in wearables and headphones. She said sales rose across both its website and stores. She said customer shopping behavior in the most recent three-month period was about the same as what Best Buy has seen for the past several quarters. \"Customers remain resilient, but deal focused and attracted to more predictable sales moments,\" such as back-to-school sales and Best Buy's October sale that coincided with Amazon's Prime Day event, she said.And she said, \"while customers continued to be thoughtful about big ticket purchases in the current environment, they are willing to spend on high priced point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation.\"Here's how the retailer did for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.40 adjusted vs. $1.31 expectedRevenue: $9.67 billion vs. $9.59 billion expected Shares were up about 5% in morning trading on Tuesday. As of Monday's close, Best Buy's stock has dropped by about 12% this year. That compares with the 14% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.Best Buy has been waiting for some of the key catalysts that tend to drive its business, such as higher housing turnover that leads to appliance purchases, the tech innovations that spark demand for devices and expert advice, and the increased willingness by inflation-weary consumers to splurge on discretionary items. Some of that tech innovation appears to be gaining momentum with sales of the Nintendo Switch 2, new iPhones and AI-enabled laptops. The company called out those merchandise categories as strengths in the most recent three-month period.Best Buy's net income for the fiscal third quarter fell to $140 million, or 66 cents per share, from net income of $273 million, or $1.26 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, including stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, Best Buy reported earnings of $1.40.Revenue rose from $9.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Best Buy's comparable sales increased 2.7% year over year. That was the company's highest comparable sales growth in four years, Barry said.In the U.S., the metric jumped 2.4%, as shoppers bought computers, gaming systems and mobile phones, but purchased fewer appliances and home theaters. Getting ready for the holidaysBest Buy's annual revenue has dropped for the past three years. With the updated guidance, the company expects annual revenue to be slightly higher than last year's total of $41.53 billion.Still, like other retailers, Best Buy said it's continuing to see shoppers spend selectively and seek out value, and anticipates that will carry into the holiday season, Barry said on a call with reporters.\"We absolutely are seeing people make trade offs,\" she said. For instance, she said, some customers are buying TVs in the middle or lower tier of its price range rather than premium TVs. However, she said Best Buy's reputation as a specialty retailer with many different brands and price points is helping it attract more low-income and younger customers.As the holiday season heats up, Barry said the company is ready for key sales days like Black Friday and Cyber Monday and will have \"deals across the spectrum for whenever people want to shop.\"Even so, the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter, saying it expects sales trends to decelerate from the previous quarter. Bilunas said the company expects comparable sales during the period to range from a 1% decline to a 1% increase.On the company's earnings call, he said Best Buy is seeing \"positive growth\" in the fourth quarter and a roughly similar trend to the third quarter, but faces tougher year over year comparisons and may see waning trends in some categories like gaming and wearables. In gaming, Nintendo Switch 2 sales haven't been as strong as they were closer to the June launch.\"Obviously, the holiday is never easy to predict,\" he said.\" What we do believe is that we have a range of scenarios and the range we've provided gives us a great place to plan and plan our business operationally.\" Higher tariffs will be a complicating factor for the rest of the year, both in how they affect the company's costs and consumer spending. On the company's earnings call, Bilunas said higher tariffs so far haven't had a meaningful impact on Best Buy's prices or its sales. He said growth is coming from more unit sales. Compared to other industries, he said, consumer electronics are a very promotional category and that's muted the impact on average selling prices, he said. Trying out Meta glasses, Sharkninja appliancesAt Best Buy's stores, the company has tried to give customers more reasons to try products by adding more vendor demos, Barry said on the company's earnings call. For example, she said more than 50 of its locations have immersive showcase areas for Meta's latest AI-enabled glasses, and demand for in-person demos has outpaced available appointments. It has launched most of its pilot showrooms with Ikea, which it is testing in 10 stores across Texas and Florida. And other vendors, including Breville and Sharkninja, are also showing off items for home baristas and chefs or customers looking for health and beauty devices in its stores, she said. Barry said \"very early reads are positive and we are excited to monitor customer response during the holidays.\"To help drive growth, Best Buy also launched a third-party marketplace in mid-August to expand the brands and the items that it sells. About three months into the launch, the company has more than 1,000 sellers and 11 times more individual items available for online customers than it did before, Barry said on the earnings call.So far, she said the company is seeing higher sales in categories like accessories and small appliances. She said customer return rates for marketplace items have run lower than first-party purchases, and more than 80% of marketplace product returns by customers have been at stores. As the marketplace grows, she said it's driving higher profits and creating new opportunities for Best Buy to sell online ads.Despite the positive signs, some of Best Buy's categories, including appliances, continue to lag.Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said the appliance category is \"probably the most difficult one that we have in the market today.\" He said historically, the company has sold new premium appliances and sets of appliances. With the slower housing market, he said the company is seeing more shoppers replace a product that's broken rather than buy a washer and dryer pair, and promotions haven't been as effective. To speed up sales, Best Buy plans to increase its labor in the department, speed up deliveries to better compete with rivals and even make some items available same day, he said.\"And hopefully as housing and different things change, then the market starts to swing back to something that might be a little bit more normal,\" he said.",

    "body": "Andrew Toth | FilmMagic | Getty ImagesThe fight between Nvidia and one of its loudest naysayers, investor Michael Burry, is escalating.Following the \"Big Short\" investor's series of social media posts arguing that the artificial intelligence investment boom is replaying the dotcom bubble from the 1990s, with Nvidia at the center of it, the chipmaker quietly circulated a private memo to analysts that explicitly namechecked Burry to push back on many of his claims.\"Nvidia emailed a memo to Wall Street sell side analysts to push back on my arguments on SBC and Depreciation. I stand by my analysis,\" Burry said in a post on Substack, referring to stock-based compensation. \"I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron. It is clearly Cisco.\"Burry has repeatedly warned that today's AI infrastructure frenzy mirrors the late-1990s telecom buildout far more than the dot-com wipeouts investors remember. He pointed to massive capex plans, extended depreciation schedules and soaring valuations as evidence that markets are again mistaking a supply boom for durable demand. The Nvidia memo, first reported by Barron's, disputed Burry's claims around depreciation life. To Burry's charge that customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units in order to justify runaway capex, Nvidia counters that its customers depreciate GPUs over four to six years based on real-world longevity and utilization patterns. Nvidia added that older GPUs such as A100s (released in 2020) continue to run at high utilization rates and retain meaningful economic value well beyond the two to three years claimed by critics.The memo also rejects Burry's suggestion of \"circular financing,\" saying Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small fraction of revenue and that AI start-ups raise capital predominantly from outside investors.Today's CiscoBurry believes Nvidia now occupies the exact same position as Cisco, the key hardware supplier that powered a massive capital investment cycle, held in 1999–2000. Just as telecommunication companies spent tens of billions of dollars laying fiber optic cable and buying Cisco gear based on forecasts that \"internet traffic doubles every 100 days,\" today's hyperscalers are promising nearly $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years, Burry said in a Substack newsletter.The heart of his Cisco analogy is overbuilt supply meeting far less demand than expected. In the early 2000s, less than 5% of U.S. fiber capacity was operational, Burry said. Today, he believes the industry's belief in boundless AI demand rests on similarly optimistic assumptions about data center power and GPU longevity. \"And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it. Its name is Nvidia,\" Burry wrote.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation next month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.The deadline for allocation is the end of day on Tuesday, with the round expected to close on Dec. 19, the sources said.This confirms earlier CNBC reporting that the company was raising $15 billion. The Tesla CEO later called the report on the round \"False\" in a post on the social media platform X.At the time, sources told CNBC that xAI would use a large portion of the money for funding graphics processing units responsible for powering large language models. CNBC had previously reported in September that the startup was looking to raise $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation.The funding round is yet another sign of the insatiable demand for AI tools. Companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have raised billions and reached sky-high valuations as investors pour more money into companies building foundational AI models. Sam Altman's OpenAI finalized a $6.6 billion-share sale at a $500 billion valuation last month, and Reuters recently reported that the ChatGPT maker was eying a $1 trillion initial public offering.Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round in September that roughly tripled its valuation from March.Musk's xAI is responsible for creating the Grok chatbot that has come under fire for disseminating hate speech, including antisemitic content. The company recently debuted Grokipedia, an AI-powered competitor to Wikipedia. In March, Musk announced the merger of xAI with X in a deal valuing the social media platform at $33 billion.",

    "body": "A Dick's Sporting Goods store in Pleasant Hill, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 24, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDick's Sporting Goods is planning to close a slew of Foot Locker stores now that its acquisition of the sneaker company is complete, the company said Tuesday when announcing fiscal third-quarter earnings.  It's unclear how many stores Dick's plans to shutter, but the closures are part of a larger restructuring it's implementing so Foot Locker isn't a drag on its profits come fiscal 2026, Dick's Executive Chairman Ed Stack told CNBC's Courtney Reagan. \"We need to clean out the garage,\" said Stack. \"We've taken pretty aggressive markdowns to clean out old merchandise. We're impairing some store assets. We'll close some stores … everything we're doing is there to protect 2026 and just kind of do this one time.\" The company declined to say how many stores would be impacted and whether the restructuring will include layoffs. As a result, Foot Locker's comparable sales are expected to be down in the mid- to high-single digits in the current quarter with margins projected to fall between 10 and 15 percentage points.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods fell roughly 3% in early trading Tuesday. Beyond the Foot Locker business, Dick's stores saw comparable sales rise 5.7% during the quarter, well ahead of the 3.6% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. For its namesake banner, the company is now expecting comparable sales to rise between 3.5% and 4%, up from its prior range of 2% to 3.5%. That's ahead of expectations for 3.6% growth, according to StreetAccount. Dick's is also now expecting full-year earnings per share to be between $14.25 and $14.55, up from a previous forecast of $13.90 to $14.50 and in line with expectations of $14.44 per share, according to LSEG. Here's how the big-box sporting goods store performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.71 expectedRevenue: $4.17 billion vs. $3.59 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 was $75.2 million, or 86 cents per share, compared with $227.8 million, or $2.75 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including the impact of the Foot Locker acquisition, Dick's posted earnings per share of $2.78.Dick's has been a standout performer across the retail industry and now has the challenge of fixing Foot Locker's business so it doesn't weigh on its typically pristine results. Dick's $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker gave it a massive competitive edge in the wholesale sneaker market, most importantly for Nike products, and access to both an international and urban consumer. It's also supercharging the company's growth. Thanks to Foot Locker's revenue, almost $931 million during the quarter, Dick's sales rose a staggering 36% to $4.17 billion from $3.06 billion a year earlier.However, it also acquired some risks. Foot Locker has about 2,400 stores globally and has underperformed for years. Its consumer tends to skew lower income than Dick's' and hasn't held up as well in a softening economy. Under CEO Mary Dillon, Foot Locker had worked to refresh its stores and change the way it merchandises sneakers. Since its acquisition, it began testing changes in 11 stores in North America to see if the fixes improve sales, including cutting products by more than 20%, bringing back apparel and changing Foot Locker's \"footwear wall.\" \"If you'd walked into a Foot Locker store before and you looked at the footwear wall … it was nothing but a run on sentence,\" said Stack. \"It was just a whole bunch of shoes thrown up on the wall, and we took all of that down, we re-merchandised it, focused on shoes we really wanted to sell. ... It's early on, but we're pretty enthusiastic about what we've done.\" — CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "watch nowMichael Burry — the investor known for predicting the housing meltdown ahead of 2008 — has turned his attention to one of the market's most beloved themes: artificial intelligence.Burry recently deregistered his hedge-fund firm, Scion Asset Management, removing it from routine regulatory disclosures. But he remains actively investing, and he is doubling down on what he sees as the next major mispricing in markets.Central to that view is Phil Clifton, Scion's former associate portfolio manager, whose research underpins the skepticism. Clifton argues that while generative AI adoption is accelerating, the economics behind the industry's massive infrastructure buildout have yet to justify the cost.In his farewell letter to Scion investors in late October, Burry called Clifton \"the most prodigious thinker\" he's ever encountered. CNBC obtained several of Clifton's research notes from earlier this year, written before he launched his own firm, Pomerium Capital, that help outline Scion's bearish thesis on AI.The investment world is \"expecting far more economic importance out of this technology than is likely to be provided,\" Clifton wrote. \"Just because a technology is good for society or revolutionizes the world doesn't mean that it's a good business proposition.\"Low marginsOn the surface, AI usage appears ubiquitous. More than 60% of U.S. adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, according to Pew Research Center. Yet Clifton said the economics on the demand side are \"surprisingly small.\" OpenAI — market leader and cultural phenomenon — is set to surpass $20 billion in annualized revenue this year, but that figure is tiny compared with the size of the AI build-out. Hyperscalers have quadrupled their capex spend in recent years to almost $400 billion annually, with expectations of $3 trillion over the next five years, according to Man Group.\"We assume other generative AI services in aggregate are insufficient to justify the sums being spent on infrastructure,\" Clifton wrote.History's warningsScion sees a clear historical parallel with the early-2000s telecom boom, when heavy investment in fiber-optic networks far outpaced actual usage. U.S. capacity utilization fell to about 5%, and wholesale telecom pricing collapsed roughly 70% in a single year, Scion noted.Clifton argues the cloud giants are now in a comparable race, expanding AI infrastructure on the assumption that future demand will catch up eventually. But if mass AI adoption takes longer than expected, the economics on these massive data center deals could become untenable.Some Big Tech companies are starting to wobble on commitments already, he noted. Microsoft has canceled data center projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe, citing an oversupply. Alibaba's chairman has warned a bubble is forming in AI infrastructure. The Nvidia ExposureNo company has benefited more from AI spending than Nvidia. The stock has surged alongside unprecedented GPU orders from cloud providers. But Scion questions whether those customers will ever generate economic returns on that investment.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia one yearA key element here is depreciation policy. Tech giants have lengthened server lifespans on the books to six years. Yet Nvidia's product cycles run every year now, making older chips functionally obsolete and less energy-efficient, long before they've been written down, Scion claims.Nvidia has pushed back at this claim, saying its hardware remains productive far longer than critics say, thanks to efficiencies driven by the company's CUDA software system.Still, Burry and other critics are seizing on a contradiction. Nvidia says the newest chips are superior in performance, efficiency and capability, at the same time as it promises that older chips remain economically viable. One of those defenses, they say, has to give.Burry has launched a new Substack newsletter to lay out his bearish thesis on AI. Whether generative AI ultimately proves to be a bubble remains to be seen, but for now, Burry is again positioning himself on the cautious side of a fast-moving story.",

    "body": "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice holds up his dog Babydog as he comes to the end of his State of the State speech in the House chambers, at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, W.Va., Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022.Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette | APThe U.S. government on Monday sued Sen. Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican, and his wife for more than $5 million in unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest dating to the 2009 tax filing year.\"Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments ...James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States,\" the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, alleged.The lawsuit, filed by the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, asks a judge to enter a judgment in favor of the U.S. against the couple in the amount of $5,164,739.75, the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service as of Aug. 4, according to the filing.Hours after the suit was docketed, a lawyer for the Justices and the DOJ filed a joint motion asking a judge to enter a consent judgment in favor of the U.S. for the amount requested.The motion, which still requires a judge's approval, indicates that the couple agreed to resolve their case by being ordered to pay the amount requested. But it does not say when they would or could pay that money.The suit was filed nearly two months after the IRS filed notices of tax liens for more than $8 million against Justice, who is the former governor of West Virginia, in Greenbrier County.One of the notices referenced a federal income tax assessment of more than $3 million for the tax year 2009, which was assessed on Nov. 25, 2015 — the same date as the assessment referenced in the lawsuit filed Monday.The second federal income tax assessment, for nearly $5 million, was for the tax filing year 2017. A third such assessment, for the 2024 tax year, was for nearly $11,000./ Politico, which first broke the news of the tax lien on Oct. 10, noted then that the IRS website says \"generally the IRS can pursue collection of a tax liability up to 10 years from the date it was assessed. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed any time within that 10-year period.\"Tuesday is the end of a 10-year period that would have begun on Nov. 25, 2015.Justice was elected to the Senate in November 2024, replacing Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent who quit the Democratic caucus earlier that year. The coal mining heir previously served as West Virginia's governor from 2017 until he entered the Senate in January.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday he expects President Donald Trump to make a decision on the new Federal Reserve chair by the holiday season.In a CNBC interview, Bessent, who has been heading the search for a successor to current Chair Jerome Powell, said he still has one interview to go and was not ready to speculate on who might get the job.\"I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,\" he said. \"But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.\"Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and recently said he'd \"love\" to fire Powell and encouraged Bessent to \"work on\" the chair to get the central bank to lower its key interest rate. Referring to Bessent, Trump even joked that \"if you don't get it fixed fast, I'm gonna fire your ass.\"\"If you were in the room, he was joking,\" Bessent said. \"We've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it's more than just cutting rates.\"Powell's term expires in May 2026, and before then he is expected to have his hands full with a suddenly divided Federal Open Market Committee that is split over the need for further cuts. Based on a recent statement from New York Fed President John Williams, markets largely expect the FOMC to approve a third consecutive cut at the December meeting.In the meantime, Bessent is continuing to interview chair candidates. The slate of finalists is believed to include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Governor Kevin Warsh, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, and current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Bessent said he envisions a different role for the Fed from the dominating position it has had since the financial crisis over the economy and financial markets.\"I think we've got to kind of simplify things,\" he said. \"I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.\"watch now",

    "body": "Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, N.J.Google EarthThat's one big deli bill to skip out of paying.A federal judge is hotter than a newly brewed pot of coffee over the failure of Peter Coker Sr. and his son, Peter Coker Jr., to pay millions of dollars in restitution for their leading roles in the notorious $100 million New Jersey deli stock fraud.The Coker convicts owe a total of $5.56 million to victims of their scam, which involved illegally inflating the stock prices of two publicly traded companies to make them attractive candidates for mergers.The scheme led to one of the companies, then-known as Hometown International, having a market capitalization of more than $100 million despite owning only one small, money-losing delicatessen in the hardscrabble south Jersey town of Paulsboro. Shares of the other company, then known as E-Waste, were worth even more on paper at one point despite owning no appreciable assets. Judge Christine O'Hearn, in a scathing order about the Cokers on Monday, said, \"It appears ... that, despite having substantial liquid assets at the time the sentence was imposed, neither Defendant has complied with the restitution deadlines set by the Court.\"\"It appears to the Court that Defendants have purposefully failed to make payment, perhaps in an effort to avoid doing so and/or dissipating or transferring assets,\" O'Hearn wrote in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.Peter Coker Sr. and his wife Susan Coker at U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, March 15, 2023.Dan Mangan | CNBCPeter Coker Sr., who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, owed his first installment of $2.5 million in restitution within 30 days of Aug. 11, according to an order by O'Hearn in August. Coker Jr., a businessman who previously lived in Hong Kong, owed his first installment of $1.5 million within 30 days of the same date.The Cokers and a third defendant who pleaded guilty in the case, James Patten, are jointly liable for the $5.56 million in total restitution. Patten has yet to be sentenced; because of that, he is not currently required to start paying restitution.Retail investors are owed $178,849 in total restitution. And investment arms of Duke and Vanderbilt universities are owed $3.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in restitution.In her Monday order, O'Hearn demanded answers from prosecutors and the Cokers' lawyers within two weeks on questions related to the failure to pay restitution so far.The judge told them \"to take all necessary steps forthwith to secure payment of the restitution amounts previously ordered.\"One potential hurdle to getting money from Peter Coker Jr. is the fact that the 57-year-old is no longer in prison — or even the United States. Coker Jr. renounced his U.S. citizenship years ago.On Oct. 16, a day after his release from prison, he was deported to the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, where he has citizenship, according to a letter to O'Hearn from his lawyer.Peter Coker Jr., left, is issued search warrants from police at his villa on the southern resort island of Phuket, Thailand, Jan. 11, 2023.Crime Suppression Division, Royal Thai Police | APHis father, Peter Coker Sr., 83, is slated to be released on Dec. 8 from a residential reentry facility in North Carolina maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, having been released from a prison in Butner, North Carolina, on Tuesday.Coker Sr.'s lawyer, Zach Intrater, in a letter last week to O'Hearn, disputed the idea that he owed any payments toward restitution while he was still locked up in prison.Intrater, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, in that letter said that \"Mr. Coker, Sr., is not looking to avoid his responsibilities under the amended judgment,\" and that he \"will begin making the required payments toward restitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

In May, O'Hearn sentenced the elder Coker to six months in jail, and Coker Jr. to 40 months in prison. The younger Coker was released last month because he received credit for the more than two years he spent locked up in a New Jersey jail before his sentencing.John Azzarello, a lawyer for Coker Jr., in a letter to the judge on Thursday, said his representation of Coker Jr. ended with his sentencing, that he has no contact with the fraudster since his sentencing, and \"we do not know Mr. Coker Jr.'s current whereabouts.\"\"Mr. Coker Jr. also has an outstanding invoice for legal services rendered which remains unpaid to date,\" Azzarello wrote. Azzarello did not respond to requests for comment.CNBC has also requested comment from the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey, which prosecuted the Cokers and Patten.",

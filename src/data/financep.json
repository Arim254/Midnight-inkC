Brendan McDermid | ReutersGreg Abel, the newly minted Chief Executive of Berkshire Hathaway, is getting a bump in salary as he takes over from the legendary investor Warren Buffett.Abel, who began his new role at the conglomerate on Jan. 1, will see his annual cash salary rise to $25 million, according to a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The raise took effect on the same date.Buffett has championed Abel in his new position. The investor told CNBC's Becky Quick in May that he would rather have Abel handle his money \"than any of the top investment advisers or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"\"It is a huge endorsement, but it's an endorsement we've made,\" Buffett told Quick.Prior to taking the helm at Berkshire, Abel was vice chairman of the company's non-insurance operations. In that post, he earned a salary of $21 million back in 2024, along with \"other compensation\" of $17,250, according to a 2025 regulatory filing.Buffett, who was leading Berkshire at the time, had an annual salary of $100,000, plus $305,111 in \"other compensation\" in 2024.",

Kennedy Jr. attend a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission event, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 22, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Tuesday said it was freezing $10 billion in federal grant funds for certain child care and family assistance programs in five states because of \"serious concerns about widespread fraud\" in state-administered programs.All five states targeted by the freeze — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York — are led by Democrats.The action applies to three programs overseen by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Children and Families: Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Social Services Block Grant.The move comes a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for a third term amid political fallout from widespread fraud in social service programs in the state, including child-care services, which a federal prosecutor has estimated cost more than $9 billion.\"Families who rely on child care and family assistance programs deserve confidence that these resources are used lawfully and for their intended purpose,\" said Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O'Neill in a statement.\"This action reflects our commitment to program integrity, fiscal responsibility, and compliance with federal requirements,\" O'Neill said.More than $7.3 billion in TANF funds have been frozen, and nearly $2.4 billion in CCDF funds have been frozen. Nearly $840 million in Social Services Block Grant funding was frozen.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump for the freeze.\"Rather than making it more affordable for families, Trump is stripping away child care from those just trying to go to work,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on X. \"Thousands depend on these programs, and now their livelihoods are at risk,\" Pritzker wrote. \"It's wrong and cruel — we'll take every step possible to defend Illinoisians.\"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a tweet, wrote, \"Trump is threatening to freeze $10 billion in child care funding in blue states to make life harder and more expensive for kids and families. It's vindictive. It's cruel. And we'll fight it with every fiber of our being.\"HHS on Monday announced that it was rescinding a series of child-care rules implemented under the Biden administration \"that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.\"\"The change will roll back provisions in the 2024 Child Care and Development Fund rule that weakened oversight and increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse in federally-funded state child care — including programs now under investigation in Minnesota,\" HHS said in a statement on Monday.The department last week froze all federal child care funding for Minnesota, which totals about $185 million annually.",

    "body": "A view of houses in the old town of Nuuk, Greenland, March 27, 2025.Leonhard Foeger | ReutersDonald Trump is interested in annexing Greenland, an Arctic island offering a wealth of untapped mineral resources. But as the U.S. president dialed up the rhetoric about America annexing the self-governing Danish territory, sparking a backlash from international leaders, a report detailed the challenges facing its economy.Published Tuesday, a report by Søren Bjerregaard, head of securities and balance of payments at Danmarks Nationalbank, warned that there were \"major challenges ahead\" for Greenland's economy. The Arctic island's economy — largely driven by the fishing industry — expanded by 0.8% in 2025 and is expected to grow a further 0.8% this year, down from 2% in 2022. According to the Danish central bank, the slowdown is likely to continue.\"The Greenlandic economy is slowing down, with modest growth and serious challenges for public finances,\" Bjerregaard wrote.\"This is partly because the expansion of infrastructure in the form of airports is nearing completion, and planned major projects in energy supply and other areas have not yet begun.\"He added that at the same time, vital shrimp stocks were declining, while public finances \"deteriorated surprisingly sharply in 2025.\" Part of the pressure on public finances was arising from a decrease in dividends from government-owned firms. \"Liquidity in the Greenland Treasury fell to a critically low level in the second half of the year,\" Bjerregaard said, noting that legislation set to be rolled out this year contains urgent fiscal tightening measures. \"More fiscal challenges lie ahead, with a declining and ageing population putting further pressure on the economy,\" he added.Greenland's population, which stood at 56,699 in the final quarter of 2025, is expected to shrink 20% by 2050, as the territory struggles to attract migrants to replace emigrating residents. Trump 'very serious' about acquiring GreenlandIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said he was \"very serious\" about acquiring the Arctic island. A day earlier, he told reporters that the U.S. needs Greenland to bolster its national security.He was speaking after Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.Trump later told The Atlantic that America \"absolutely\" needs Greenland, with the president telling the magazine that countries aside from Venezuela could be subject to U.S. intervention.Trump has long floated the idea of taking Greenland. In early 2025, he said the U.S. would assume control \"one way or the other.\"Officials in Greenland, Denmark and across the European continent have rejected the notion that the U.S. can make any claim on Greenland.Read moreOn Monday, Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, rebuked parallels between the territory and Venezuela. \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,\" Nielsen told a news conference. \"Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela. We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years.\"",

    "body": "An American flag flies at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California, on Sept. 12, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board on Wednesday once again unanimously recommended that WBD shareholders reject a hostile takeover offer from Paramount Skydance. The board said it continued to believe the Paramount bid is \"inferior\" to a previously announced deal with Netflix to buy WBD's studio and streaming business for $72 billion. \"We have a signed merger agreement with Netflix, it's a compelling value, a clear path to closing and protections for our shareholders if something stops the close, whatever that might be,\" WBD board chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber on \"Squawk Box\" Wednesday morning. In the days following the announcement of that deal, Paramount launched its hostile bid, taking directly to shareholders an offer of $30 per share, all-cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its TV networks. WBD's board made an initial recommendation to reject the offer, and Paramount subsequently made another push for the coveted assets. In late December Paramount guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, as a clear response to questions raised by WBD's board. Di Piazza previously told CNBC that the board had concerns about the backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In an amended offer late last year, Paramount said Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. However, Paramount Skydance stopped short of upping the amount of its bid.  \"PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,\" the WBD board said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday. \"The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its 'best and final' proposal,\" the board continued. Paramount first showed interest in acquiring all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets in September. The company made three takeover offers before Warner Bros. Discovery kicked off a formal sale process, inviting other bidders into the fold. Representatives for Paramount didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

    "body": "A startup in the clean-water space is making a curious bet on beer. Curious, because the beer is made from recycled shower and laundry water. San Francisco-based Epic Cleantec launched in 2015 as a wastewater recycling company using its proprietary technology to clean and reuse water in office and apartment buildings. At the time, CEO Aaron Tartakovsky said, \"We need to overhaul our flush and forget society.\" Now, he's taking it to the next level. \"A lot of it was psychology,\" he said. \"It is getting people comfortable with the concept of recycled water. And we found that if you tell people that the water is clean, maybe they trust you, maybe they don't. But you take those exact same molecules of recycled water, put them into a beautiful beer can, all of a sudden, people love it.\"For the beer, Epic's systems collect water just from showers and laundries and then run it through several treatment steps, including filters, biological treatment, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis and disinfection, according to the company. The resulting clean water is then taken to Devil's Canyon Brewing Co., where it's made into beer. The beer is available for online orders in California, Virginia, Oregon, Ohio, Kentucky, Vermont, New Hampshire, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Alaska and Washington, D.C., and in retail locations in California.It takes about 10 gallons of water to make a gallon of beer, so using recycled water has a huge impact on the water supply. Epic's IPA is also made with drought-resistant and energy-efficient hops, grain and yeast — emphasizing environmental impact from grain to glass. But, again, it's not about the beer. \"Buildings use about 15% of all the fresh water on this planet,\" Tartakovsky said. \"We need to do things differently, and that means we need to tell the story differently. We need to engage people differently.\"Jordan Langer, CEO of events company Non Plus Ultra, was an original investor in Epic when it was just about buildings. Now, he serves the beer at his events.\"I was a little bit skeptical. I'm not a believer in gimmicks,\" Langer said. \"But I was wrong. It blew up like crazy. It has given a lot of spotlight onto Epic Cleantec, which has made it really, quite, quite interesting.\"In addition to three family offices, Epic Cleantec is backed by J-Ventures, J-Impact and Echo River Capital. Total funding to date is $25 million. Epic currently has two beer offerings, Shower Hour IPA and Laundry Club Kölsch. Tartakovsky said the company is also considering making a nonalcoholic beer.— CNBC producer Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 6, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday said that the company is seeing \"very high\" customer demand in China for its H200 AI chips, which the U.S. government recently signaled that it would approve for export. Huang added that Nvidia has started producing the chips again and is working out the final details about export licenses with the U.S. government. Nvidia's chips are critical for companies developing artificial intelligence models. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas. Investors see the Chinese market as a massive opportunity for Nvidia as the country's tech companies develop their own AI models. Huang has previously said that the market could be worth $50 billion per year, and none of those sales are currently included in Nvidia's forecasts.In December, President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could export its H200 chip to China as long as the company paid 25% of those sales to the U.S. government. The H200 is a generation or two behind the latest Nvidia models, but unlike previous chips that Nvidia was approved to export to China, this model has not been slowed down on purpose to comply with export restrictions.China must also approve the import of Nvidia's chips. Huang on Tuesday said that he is not expecting China to make an announcement that imports have been approved and that Nvidia would know the regulatory status as purchase orders come in. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Huang added that any H200 sales would be in addition to the $500 billion two-year forecast the company provided last year. \"It appears that we're going to be going back to China,\" Huang said.WATCH: Nvidia is clearly the chips leader in AI trade, says Silvant Capital's Sansoterrawatch now",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's xAI said it raised $20 billion in a funding round, exceeding its prior target of $15 billion. CNBC reported in November that a financing would value the artificial intelligence startup at about $230 billion. After an initial report that xAI was raising $15 billion, Musk called the story \"False\" in a post on X.Investors included Nvidia and Cisco Investments as well as long-time Musk company backers Valor Equity Partners, Stepstone Group, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi's MGX and Baron Capital Group. Both Nvidia and Cisco work with xAI as vendors and strategic partners.AI startups reached sky-high valuations in 2025, raising massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for their foundational models. In October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation, and a month later Anthropic was valued at around $350 billion, with capital coming from Microsoft and Nvidia. Musk's AI venture now owns and operates his social network X after merging with the company, formerly known as Twitter, in March. The company faces a new flurry of regulatory probes by authorities in Europe, India and Malaysia after its Grok chatbot generated sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults, mostly women. Users shared the images widely on X.Musk is centering xAI's infrastructure buildout in Memphis, Tennessee. The data centers, which use natural gas-burning turbines as a power source, have drawn consternation from many nearby residents, as emissions have contributed to air quality problems in the area, according to local researchers.Despite its controversies, xAI landed a deal with the Department of Defense, which recently added Grok to its AI agents platform. Grok is also the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi.WATCH: xAI raises $20 billion watch now",

    "body": "Sermitsiaq Mountain looms behind a row of houses in Nuuk, Greenland, on March 4, 2025.Odd Andersen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump is fixated on taking control of Greenland, a vast, sparsely populated and mineral-rich island situated between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. \"It's so strategic,\" Trump told reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday. \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.\" His comments, which came hot on the heels of an audacious military operation in Venezuela, sounded the alarm across Europe, with Denmark warning that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of the NATO military alliance.The U.S. president, however, is yet to waver. Indeed, the White House ramped up transatlantic tensions even further on Tuesday, saying that Trump and his team are considering \"a range of options\" to make the self-governing Danish territory a part of the United States — including \"utilizing the U.S. Military.\" Positioned between the U.S. and Russia, Greenland has long been viewed as an area of high strategic importance, particularly when it comes to Arctic security.  The territory of nearly 57,000 people is in close proximity to emerging Arctic shipping routes, with the rapid melting of ice creating opportunities to substantially reduce Asia-Europe travel time when compared to the Suez Canal.Greenland also sits astride the so-called GIUK gap, a naval choke point between Greenland, Iceland and the U.K. that links the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean. Alongside its strategic geopolitical position, Greenland is known for an abundance of untapped raw materials, from oil and gas reserves to critical mineral deposits and a treasure trove of rare earth elements. AFP | Getty ImagesThese critical minerals and rare earth elements are vital components in emerging technologies, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, energy storage technologies, and national security applications. China repeatedly sought to leverage its near monopoly of rare earths to exert pressure on the U.S. last year.\"Trump is a real estate guy,\" Clayton Allen, head of practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, told CNBC by video call.\"Greenland is sitting on some of the most valuable real estate in terms of economic advantage and strategic defense for the next three to five decades.\" Shipping routes To be sure, the U.S. already has a presence in Greenland. The Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, is located in the northwest of Greenland, just across the Baffin Bay from Nunavut, Canada.It is estimated that around 150 U.S. service members are permanently stationed there, down from around 6,000 during the Cold War era.watch now\"For good reasons, the U.S. has an early warning air base in northwestern Greenland because the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach the continental United States is via Greenland and the North Pole,\" said Otto Svendsen, associate fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. The base, which also has an active airfield and is home to the world's northernmost deep-water port, has traditionally been pivotal to the monitoring of Russian submarines traversing the GIUK gap, Svendsen said. \"A more recent and emerging threat or factor is the fact that Greenland straddles two potential shipping routes through the Arctic, the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route,\" Svendsen told CNBC by telephone. \"And as climate change continues to render those routes more viable, there are commercial interests there as well that add to the national security value of the island,\" he added.A fishing boat navigates around icebergs that broke off from the Jakobshavn Glacier and are floating in Disko Bay on March 10, 2025, in Ilulissat, Greenland.Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. 'Golden Dome' Analysts say that Greenland could prove useful to the U.S. as a staging ground for a greater defensive presence and as a location for U.S. missile interceptors — particularly in the context of one of the Trump administration's key policies: a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.The multibillion-dollar initiative, rolled out in May last year and often compared to Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system, is a visionary plan designed to shield the U.S. from all missile attacks. Read more\"The U.S. needs access to the Arctic and it doesn't really have that much direct access today. Greenland has a tremendous amount. The U.S. needs air defenses deployed closer and closer to Russia to combat next generation weapons that are not currently defensible with what we have available. Greenland provides that,\" Eurasia Group's Allen said. \"Trump wants to build a 'Golden Dome' over the U.S.,\" he continued. \"Part of that is going to have to depend on Greenland.\" National or economic security? For some, Trump's assertion that annexing Greenland is a core part of U.S. national security has raised eyebrows. The declaration marks a notable shift in tone from almost a year ago, when the then president-elect cited \"economic security\" as a primary factor for annexing the island. Marion Messmer, director of the International Security Programme at London's Chatham House think tank, acknowledged that it is true to say that both Russia and China have increased their military activities in the Arctic in recent years — and, if Moscow launched missiles at the U.S., they would likely fly over Greenland.  \"However, what is not clear is why Washington needs full control over Greenland to defend itself,\" Messmer said in a written analysis published Tuesday. watch nowShe cited the fact that the U.S. already has a presence at Pituffik Space Base, as well as a decades-old defense agreement with Denmark that allows Washington to continue to use it. \"During the Cold War, the US stationed up to 6,000 troops across a range of camps across the island,\" Messmer said. \"It could presumably surge troop presence again if it felt it needed a greater presence in the region – without disputing Danish sovereignty.\"",

    "body": "Two employees in pharmaceutical industry wearing protective gloves, mask, cap and white suit seen standing by the machine that is the part of the medicaments production during the working hours in a pharmaceutical manufacturing.Extreme-photographer | E+ | Getty ImagesA multitude of factors are coming together to bring a big burst in biotech M&A.The high-profile bidding war between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over Metsera and its leading weight loss drug candidate shows just how competitive some pockets of the sector have become, as Big Pharma frantically works to fill the looming revenue hole.Some of the best-selling drugs in the world are facing a loss of exclusivity in key jurisdictions in what the sector calls \"the patent cliff.\" By 2032, losses of exclusivity for best-selling brands are worth at least $173.9 billion in annual sales, according to CNBC calculations. Estimates vary on the total amount of revenue at risk when factoring in smaller brands, with some analysts putting the number between $200 billion and $350 billion.That poses a real threat to their makers' top lines — unless they manage to replenish their pipelines with new, revenue-bearing innovations.The need for pharma to top up their pipelines coincides with the broader biotech sector coming back to life after years of depressed valuations following a boom in healthcare investing during the Covid-19 pandemic.M&A in the sector picked up dramatically in September and October 2025, following a terrible start to the year. The lifting of overhangs from Trump's war on high drug prices for Americans and threats of triple-digit pharma sector tariffs, as well as the beginning of an interest-rate cutting cycle, has further encouraged dealmaking.Now, companies are facing a situation where they need to fill their pipelines, while also navigating a competitive environment for the best assets.Filling the revenue holeThe biopharma sector is unique in that companies face a loss of patent for lead assets every decade or so. That lifecycle of assets requires companies to constantly come up with new innovations – or buy those who do.\"Biotech, being the innovation kind of engine of healthcare, is where pharmaceutical companies have come historically to build their biopharma businesses,\" Linden Thomson, senior portfolio manager at Candriam, told CNBC.Pharmaceutical firms, many of which started as chemical companies, typically built their businesses on simpler, small molecule drugs, while biotechs use living organisms to make medicines like antibodies and mRNA. Over time, the distinction between the two has blurred as pharma invested heavily in biotech and many of the drugs on the market today were instead discovered by biotech companies or involved with biotech manufacturing, Thomson said.The looming patent cliff, which includes the loss of exclusivity on Bristol Myers Squibb's Eliquis, Merck's Keytruda, and Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, is a driving force behind M&A and a key part of many large-cap pharma companies' business strategy.watch nowAccording to analysis by healthcare market researcher and consultant Joanna Sadowska, about half of the blockbuster drugs approved between 2014 and 2023 were bought, as opposed to being developed internally. The two most successful drugmakers in terms of the number of blockbusters approved over those years were Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca, which acquired eight and five medicines out of a total of 13, respectively.European heavyweights GSK and Novartis are among those clear about the need to add to their pipelines through deals. Both are looking for what they call \"bolt-on deals\" that fit in with their key therapeutic and technology areas.During an investor event in London in November, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan emphasized the company's strong cash generation \"that really allows us to invest in the business.\"While Novartis doesn't put a size on these bolt-on deals, having done deals of up to $12 billion, GSK is more specific.Chris Sheldon, global head of business development at GSK, calls it the \"sweet spot\": going after validated biology, often in mid-stage development in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, where the outcome of a drug candidate isn't yet obvious. Many acquisitions of late-stage assets end up becoming a maths problem, Sheldon told CNBC, particularly if it's a listed company that has reached fair value.\"BD [Business development] I always describe as a contact sport. If an asset is good enough, there's multiple suitors,\" he added.Deals can range from partnerships and licensing and royalties agreements to clear-cut buyouts.\"We would do licensing every day of the week versus M&A if we could, because you can manage risk and reward the partner as value is unlocked and risk is discharged,\" Sheldon said.However, an acquisition with a big price tag paid up front may at times be the only option, and it can have some attractive benefits, such as taking total control of the development plans and acquiring talent as well as the molecules. \"The reality is actually the seller often dictates that, a lot of people don't realize that,\" Sheldon said.A competitive environmentAs biotech M&A became hot again, November saw arguably the sector's most dramatic event of the year take place: the public bidding war between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over clinical-stage weight loss drug maker Metsera, ultimately won by Pfizer in a deal worth up to $10 billion.It's rare for bidding to take place in the public eye, said Stefan Loren, managing director at Oppenheimer. \"It's a very public thing to chase a company, and so you have to worry about the reputational damage: A, if you lose; B: if you get too exuberant and go to buy,\" he told CNBC.\"That definitely says something about the biotech market and companies wanting to play catch-up,\" Loren added. \"They are responding to what their situation is, their situation is that they're about to have a lot of things come off patent.\"[Business development] I always describe as a contact sport. If an asset is good enough, there's multiple suitors.Chris SheldonGlobal head of business development at GSKTypically, pharma shopping sprees tend to last up to a year and a half before pulling back, Loren added.The GLP-1 market for weight loss drugs has become one of the most competitive segments in global pharma as major players race to secure next-generation assets through both internal development and acquisitions, noted PitchBook researchers in their 2026 Healthcare outlook published early December. More than 120 metabolic assets are currently in development across 60 companies, creating a deep pool of potential M&A targets, they added.\"The high-profile battle between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk for Metsera underscores the escalating strategic urgency in this space,\" they said. \"We expect competition to intensify as differentiation windows narrow and policy tailwinds expand reimbursement and regulatory support.\"While the obesity space lends itself well to illustrate current competitive dynamics, the biotech boom isn't confined to one single therapeutic area. Neurology, oncology, immunology, and inflammation are other key areas of activity.\"It's idiosyncratic what's popular at any given point,\" said Loren. \"They [companies] are going for what can fill the pipelines as quickly as possible.\"A boom, dip and another boomDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, biotech sailed to the top of investors' wishlists. Amid increased attention, investors' optimism, and low interest rates, the sector flourished, valuations skyrocketed, and many biotech companies went public or were bought by larger peers.As the biopharma industry is a cost-intensive research business, raising money is critical for drug discovery. Early-stage biotechs operate with high stakes, often making them early casualties of a risk-off market like the one following the pandemic boom.Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration also clouded the outlook for biopharma with threats of high sector tariffs, cuts to federal health agencies, and lower drug prices. But as companies have made deals with Trump on pricing and the president has made clear that if they invest in U.S. manufacturing, they would be exempt from additional tariffs — two big overhangs for the sector have cleared.A flurry of good data readouts has also boosted biotech valuations, said Loren. Only a year ago, even good data sent stocks down, he said. \"People were using everything as an event just to get out.\"By late spring, the market started to shift and now, investors take good data and run with it. \"There's a point at which these things get so low that at the end of the day, what's the risk?\" Loren said. \"And now, when we saw the acceleration of M&A, the good news is that that play became very real.\"More deals in 2026In 2026, deals could pick up even further, analysts say.\"We see 2026 as providing one of the best investing opportunities we have seen in decades,\" the PitchBook analysts said, driven by the clearing of U.S. healthcare policy overhangs and additional rate cuts spurring more speculative investing postures.Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, similarly expects a \"big ramp up of deal flows\" in the year ahead now that the noise around drug pricing has settled.\"The market's margin expectations beyond [2026] might be a bit more optimistic than it should be, but nonetheless, the companies are deploying capital in the U.S., manufacturing is happening, clarity is there, and that is a great environment for actually doing biotech deals and early stage biotech funding,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowOther developments in the pharma sector could make for another year of significant headwinds – potentially adding to the urgency for drugmakers to make deals.Prices for certain bestselling drugs will start to come down under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act in 2026, which appears to treat the active ingredient of drugs by the same manufacturer as the same, limiting life cycle management options in some cases, HSBC analysts said. Biosimilars in the U.S. might also become easier to launch if a recent Food and Drug Administration draft guidance is implemented. \"All these factors might mean that the fade beyond the patent cliffs, especially for biologics, might be more aggressive than in the past,\" the analysts said.",

    "body": "Packages in a United States Postal Service (USPS) truck near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 24, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon has angered some online retailers that say they didn't consent to have their products scraped and listed on the e-commerce giant's sprawling marketplace.In February, the company announced \"Shop Direct,\" a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled \"Buy for Me,\" an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf.Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers. In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to posts on Reddit and Instagram. Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock.\"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in an Instagram post in late December. The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address. Bobo Design Studio CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its Shopify website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California.Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in an FAQ on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\"\"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory.watch nowMore than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce, Wix and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said. An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\" \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing branddirect@amazon.com, and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right. Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company said the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000.It's all part of Amazon's push into e-commerce agents, a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI, Google and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window. Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company sued Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf. In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\" In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.

Odd Andersen | Afp | Getty ImagesLONDON — European stocks were in mixed territory on Wednesday morning, as regional market jitters grow over U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to annex Greenland. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was little changed in early trade, with sectors and major regional bourses in mixed territory. European defense stocks moved higher, with the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index adding around 0.3% — paring an earlier bigger rise, but putting it on course for its fourth consecutive day of gains. Global market attention is turning to President Trump's intention regarding Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, following the U.S. military operation that led to the capture and arrest of Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro.The president and his team are considering \"a range of options\" to acquire Greenland — including \"utilizing the U.S. Military,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC on Tuesday.Trump has insisted that the U.S. needs the Arctic island for national security purposes and, this week, pointed to Russian and Chinese activities in the region.watch nowGreenland and Denmark have both repeatedly said that the country is not up for grabs, and European leaders on Tuesday issued a statement that said, \"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"In a separate statement on Tuesday evening, Danish Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Denmark would spend 88 billion Danish kroner ($13.8 billion) on rearming Greenland given \"the serious security situation we find ourselves in.\"\"I hope that the United States also recognizes that fact and is ready to cooperate on our common interest in Arctic security,\" he said. \"Because Denmark would like to continue to be an ally of the United States. But that requires a mutual willingness to show respect and cooperation.\"Read moreLooking at individual stocks in Europe, logistics firm InPost shed 5.8% to tumble to the bottom of the Stoxx 600 in early trade. The stock gained 28% in Tuesday's session after the company said it had received an indicative proposal for an acquisition of all its shares. Elsewhere, Bayer shares rose 1.1% after the company announced it was suing Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna, alleging the companies had used its mRNA technology in their own immunizations for the virus. In lawsuits filed in Delaware federal court on Tuesday, Bayer accused the companies of patent infringement. \"Moderna is aware of the litigation and will defend ourselves against these claims,\" a spokesperson for Moderna said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Beyond that, we do not have a comment.\"Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Data releases on Wednesday include flash euro zone inflation data for December, with economists polled by Reuters expecting a rate of 2%, in line with the European Central Bank's target.",

Xny/star Max | Gc Images | Getty ImagesSeven U.S. service members were injured during Saturday's U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a Pentagon official told MS Now on Wednesday.Two of the seven are still recovering, while five have recovered from their injuries sustained in the operation dubbed \"Absolute Resolve.\"\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the official said.The official said an assessment of casualties on the ground was still ongoing and is being led by the U.S. intelligence community.Venezuelan officials previously told MS Now that more than 70 people were killed in the raid. Special operations forces from multiple service branches and more than 150 military aircraft were involved in the capture of Maduro.U.S. President Donald Trump said the military action was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, according to a post on Truth Social on Saturday.Cuba said on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed during the operation, adding that those individuals were carrying out missions for Cuba's armed forces and interior ministry. The statement was posted by Cuba's presidential office on Facebook.The U.S. strikes followed weeks of military buildup in the region and repeated threats by Trump against Maduro.The deposed leader appeared in a New York court on Monday, where he said he had been \"kidnapped\" with his wife by U.S. forces from his home in Caracas and described himself as a \"prisoner of war.\" He pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.— CNBC's Lim Hui Jie and MS Now's Julia Jester contributed to this report.watch now",

John Lamparski | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe statement was posted hours after a tweet by the conservative independent journalist Nick Sortor, which contained a video of him visiting the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeview Minneapolis on Monday night — hours after Everpeak issued its apology — and trying to book 10 rooms for what Sortor said were DHS employees.\"So, we're not accepting people from Immigration, ICE agents, DHS into our property,\" the clerk said. \"That's just our management, ownership.\"When Sortor said he thought the policy had changed \"today\" — Monday — the clerk replied, \"I just talked to the owner of the building, and he didn't say there had been any changes.\"\"Yeah, it's just policy,\" the clerk said. The clerk, who also said \"I'm new here,\" then repeated that he had not been informed of any policy changes, and he offered to speak to the owner. When the clerk returned, he said he had been unable to reach anyone in authority because of the late hour.Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement officers question a man's status on Lake Street near a Somali mall called the Karmel Mall in Minnesota, United States on December 10, 2025.

    "body": "watch nowPrediction market traders ramped up bets that more international shake-ups may lie ahead in the wake of President Donald Trump's raid on Venezuela.Traders on the burgeoning platforms have recently committed money based on where the White House might turn its focus next. The amped-up bets come as Wall Street and Main Street note the Trump administration's shift toward quick and forceful international strikes.\"The big takeaway for investors is Trump is growing much more comfortable with, and confident in, the use of military force,\" Piper Sandler analyst Andy Laperriere wrote to clients on Monday. \"His first year in his second term was characterized by boundless energy and risk-taking, and that has been extended to the use of the military.\"Odds that Trump will \"take back the Panama Canal\" before early 2029 jumped above 35% on the Kalshi prediction market, from less than 30% late last week. Trump said last year that he wouldn't rule out using military force to gain control of the maritime route linking the Pacific to the Atlantic.The likelihood that the U.S. will \"take control of any part of Greenland\" rose to 38% midday Tuesday — an increase of roughly 8 percentage points since the middle of last week. At one point over the weekend, the odds shot above 46%.A larger market, based on the dollar amount of wagering, that Trump will \"buy at least part\" of the Danish territory, hovered near 25% odds, up from less than 20% seen late last week.Combined betting on both questions on Kalshi amounts to close to $2.5 million.Painted houses and residential apartment blocks overlooking the fjord in Nuuk, Greenland, Nov. 3, 2025.Juliette Pavy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLeaders in Greenland have repeatedly rejected Trump's comments that the U.S. aims for a takeover.

The chance of this happening, part of nearly a $1 million market, now trades at around 54%.Trump authorized bombings on Iran last year, bringing the U.S. into the conflict between the Islamic republic and Israel. Last week, Trump threatened to \"knock the hell\" out of Iran if it sought to rebuild its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down,\" Trump said. \"We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"watch now",

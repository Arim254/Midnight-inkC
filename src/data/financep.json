    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

Trump | Via Truth SocialA government official and top royal from the United Arab Emirates purchased a $500 million stake in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture last year, months before the Trump administration greenlit the sale of advanced AI chips to the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — is the Gulf nation's national security adviser and manager of its largest wealth fund. Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company, took a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, according to the Journal. The deal would make Aryam the largest shareholder of World Liberty, and the company's only known investor besides the founders, the Journal reported.World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.The company counts President Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The deal, according to the Journal, was signed by Eric Trump in the days before his father's second inauguration as president. It came as Tahnoon was seeking access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S., which the Biden administration had blocked over concerns that the chips would end up in China. According to the Journal, the agreement saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities and $31 million to Witkoff family entities.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

The agreement called for a fifth of the chips to go to Tahnoon's own AI company, G42.The Journal report has prompted new scrutiny of the Trump administration's dealings with the UAE and Tahnoon, with some in Congress warning of potential conflicts of interest or corruption. \"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"The Trump Administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.\"Warren called on Witkoff, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"testify in front of Congress on mounting evidence that they sold out American national security in order to benefit the President's crypto company — and about whether any officials lined their own pockets in the process.\"White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the Journal that \"[t]here are no conflicts of interest.\" She added that Witkoff is working to \"advance President Trump's goals of peace around the world.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also defended the president on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\"I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn't do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office,\" Blanche said. Republicans and Trump have long accused the Biden family of corruption over the former President Joe Biden's family's business dealings abroad. Though an impeachment inquiry was launched in the House over the matter, evidence of wrongdoing by Biden never materialized. \"I don't have a comment on it beyond President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons,\" Blanche said. \"This idea that there's something untoward or unprecedented is just a repeated story that isn't true.\"Read the complete Wall Street Journal story here.",

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

Aaron Schwartz | ReutersHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said he believes he has the votes to end the partial government shutdown by Tuesday, with the House set to take up a Senate-approved spending package this week. \"Let's say I'm confident that we'll do it at least by Tuesday,\" the Louisiana Republican said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday morning after Congress failed to approve a spending package and send it to President Donald Trump by the Jan. 30 deadline. Senate Democrats demanded changes to the package that the House originally passed after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Democrats ultimately had the Department of Homeland Security funding stripped from the package and replaced with two-week stopgap funding for the agency. Now, the amended package has to be reapproved by the House.The House is set to begin taking up the bill on Monday. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first step in that process.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

House Democrats are demanding assurances that changes to DHS's immigration operations will be finalized before voting on the spending package. \"Well, we're going to have that conversation later on today and as we return to Washington. But the one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on ABC's \"This Week\" when asked how he and Democrats will vote. \"The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today,\" he said.Sources familiar with the matter told MS NOW over the weekend that Jeffries spoke with Johnson and said Democrats will not provide the votes to fast-track the spending package, potentially jeopardizing the end of the shutdown this week.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he will vote against the package when it comes to the floor. \"I'm not just a no, I'm a firm no, and I'm going to advocate with colleagues that they vote no,\" Khanna said. \"I just in good conscience cannot vote to give more money to ICE agents as they're violating our constitutional rights.\"Democratic resistance to the package makes Johnson's job of pushing the package through significantly harder. He has a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House, set to dwindle further after Democrat Christian Menefee won a special election in Texas. \"I have a one-vote margin, yes, for the rest of 2026,\" Johnson said. \"But we're going to demonstrate once again that this is the party that takes governing seriously.\"In addition to the stopgap for DHS, the package includes bills to fully fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year.This story is developing.

    "body": "For most of the past two decades, the majority of electric vehicle-related investments have gone to Republican-led districts, especially in the Southeast. With the industry pulling back from electric cars and trucks, the fate of those investments is now an open question. Automakers and battery makers invested more $200 billion in EV and battery manufacturing facilities in the U.S. from roughly 2000 to 2024, according to data and policy research firm Atlas Public Policy. About 84% of battery investments went to Republican-led districts, as well as 62% of EV manufacturing investments, the firm said. These were expected to create more than 200,000 jobs, 77% of which would be in Republican districts.Almost half of all that investment — 40% — went to the Southeastern U.S., according to Atlas. For more than half a century, the South has become a manufacturing hub for the automotive industry, but the EV push yielded some of the biggest investments in the history of the region.Then federal incentives for EVs enacted through the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act were stripped away, and sales fell short of expectations. The companies that can are pivoting to other types of vehicles or entirely different products to avoid losses and layoffs. Hyundai MetaplantThe Hyundai Metaplant is seen on Sept. 9, 2025, in Ellabell, Georgia.   Elijah Nouvelage | AFP | Getty ImagesHyundai Motor Group is one of the automakers making changes after an EV push.The group, which includes the Hyundai, Genesis and Kia brands, was for a time the No. 2 seller of EVs in the country after Tesla, according to José Muñoz, CEO of Hyundai Motor Company.But the end of federal incentives for EVs was immediately followed by a dramatic drop in sales. Overall, HMG's EV sales were growing in the first quarter. By the fourth quarter, they had fallen 50%. \"We still do better than the industry,\" Munoz said, \"But it had an impact in the industry, which we could clearly see in the fourth quarter.\"Hyundai has long had a large factory in Montgomery, Alabama, but the company made an unprecedented bet on a $12.6 billion EV factory and joint battery ventures outside Savannah, Georgia, when it announced it in 2022.The Hyundai Metaplant, as it is called, was the largest investment in Georgia's history, taking the title from Rivian's $5 billion factory outside Atlanta. Hyundai estimated the plant would hire about 8,500 workers by 2031, with another 6,900 at nearby suppliers. As of January, the company had hired about 1,440. In 2024, Georgia led the nation in EV manufacturing investment, according to Atlas. Its Republican governor, Brian Kemp, had said he wanted to make the state the \"electric mobility capital\" of the United States. Hyundai's Metaplant factory was originally intended solely for EV production. The company actually sped up construction so its critically acclaimed — and, for an EV, strong-selling — Ioniq5 crossover would be eligible for the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. The Inflation Reduction Act required that EVs be assembled in the U.S. and have a minimum U.S. parts content to qualify. But the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" took those credits away, as of Sept. 30. As a result, Hyundai announced an additional $2.7 billion investment in Metaplant to increase production by 200,000 units, targeting an annual output of half a million cars. It is now planning a mix of 10 hybrids and EVs, and Munoz expects sales volumes will be about 30% EVs and 70% hybrid and gas. Write-downsHaig Partners managing director John Murphy has estimated that automakers in the U.S. will likely face at least $100 billion in write-downs on their EV investments, meaning those investments are unlikely to yield the expected profits — or any profits at all. \"It's the single biggest capital allocation mistake in the history of the automotive industry,\" Murphy said.It's already started. Ford said in December it will take a $19.5 billion charge on its EV business, which has not turned a profit, while crosstown rival General Motors said it will take a $7.6 billion charge. International automakers such as Honda, Porsche and Volvo have all warned investors of similar charges of at least a billion dollars. Muñoz told CNBC he does not expect Hyundai have write-downs. A key Hyundai strategy is flexibility — making 10 models in single plant — as it plans to do in Metaplant, or even 12 in its soon-to-open factory in Ulsan, South Korea, which has given it the ability to pivot as market conditions change. \"The more flexibility you have, the less issues you have with changes in the environment,\" he said. \"So I think, knock on wood, I don't think we're going to see these types of write-offs that we've seen with other competitors.\"EV sales forecasts are a fraction of what the industry was expecting just a few years ago. The Biden administration wanted 50% of new car sales to be EVs by 2030. \"That was the target,\" said Peter Tadros, president of North America powertrain solutions for Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier. \"Then, over the years, it dropped to 35, to 25, to 17. So now we're at 17% projection for 2030. So a huge, huge gap from the initial projection.\"Bosch had made a $250 million investment in its factory in Charleston, South Carolina, which included plans for an electric motors division. \"Now the investment was not made for 50% market, but it was not made also for 17%,\" Tadros said.That means the company has had to adjust. Bosch was able to move nearly all employees from the EV motors division to other departments. The factory also produces safety devices such as electronic stability control and fuel injection systems — which it expects to be in greater demand as the market pivots back to gas-burning vehicles. Still, the bet it made on EVs did \"cause some pain,\" Tadros said. \"You're stranded with this equipment, not producing as many as it should be producing to make up for this depreciation,\" Tadros said. \"So it's here. It's ready to go. We look forward to making a lot more motors in the future. But right now, it's a difficult situation for that segment.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

    "body": "SLB Headquarters, Houston, Tx.Courtesy: SLBCorporate earnings along with geopolitical concerns have swayed investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. But investors seeking consistent income against a volatile backdrop can always add attractive dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios. For discerning investors, top Wall Street analysts can help select the right stocks, backed by strong cash flows to support consistent dividend payments. Here are three dividend-paying stocks that are highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Viper EnergyViper Energy (VNOM), a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, primarily the Permian in West Texas. Considering the base and variable dividends paid over the past year, VNOM stock offers a dividend yield of 5.53%. Ahead of Viper's Q4 2025 results in February, Roth Capital analyst Leo Mariani reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock with a price target of $48. The analyst is bullish on VNOM based on its high \"organic growth rate vs. peers, a solid and growing dividend, strong free cash flow even at lower oil prices and a multi-year line of sight on its operations not had by its peers.\"Mariani expects Viper Energy to deliver strong Q4 results with oil production of 66,552 barrels of oil per day (Bopd), about 1% above the Street estimate. He expects total production of 129,424 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) for Q4 2025, or almost 2% above the consensus estimate. Mariani also anticipates that Viper will report solid oil price realizations for Q4 2025, but weaker gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) realizations. The 5-star analyst expects Viper to announce a cash distribution to shareholders of $0.57 for Q4 2025, reflecting a sequential decline of 2%. But he expects $95 million worth of share buybacks in Q4 2025, up from $90 million in the third quarter. Mariani expects share buybacks to play a larger role in Viper's capital return plans, especially compared with a subdued oil backdrop.Mariani also describes Viper as more insulated than its peers if 2026 drilling and completion activity is cut due to weak oil prices. That's because Diamondback operates about 60% of its production and can scale back cut activity outside VNOM's mineral acreage, helping protect volumes. Moreover, VNOM's non-operated activity is led by top-tier operators like Exxon Mobil, Occidental, EOG Resources, ConocoPhillips, and Ovintiv, which lowers the risk of sharply lower activity, as they control about two-thirds of Viper's non-Diamondback acreage.Mariani ranks No. 124 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.1%. See Viper Energy Statistics on TipRanks.SLB The week's second dividend pick is oilfield services provider SLB (SLB). The company recently reported  better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2025. Moreover, SLB announced a 3.5% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.295 per share. SLB pays a dividend yield of 2.41%. Following the Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on SLB and raised his price target to $54 from $43. The analyst noted that SLB's 2026 guidance was in line with consensus expectations, adding that encouraging insights from the earnings call reflect management's optimism about improvement in three international areas — Saudi Arabia, Mexico and deepwater — which hurt the company's 2025 performance.SLB expects its international segment to gain from business in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia in 2026, partially offset by a modest fall in revenue in Europe and Africa, the 5-star analyst said. SLB is also expected to benefit from the revitalization of Venezuela's oil industry, as it's the only Western oil field services company currently operating in the country as part of Chevron's operating license. Meanwhile, SLB's Gulf of Mexico presence and growth in the Data Center Solutions segment are expected to drive revenue in North America. \"The growth dynamics of Digital and Data Center Solutions remain key longer-term catalysts for SLB,\" said Jayaram. Overall, Jayaram expects SLB to deliver solid cash flow growth, driven by the company's international footprint, project integration capabilities and robust digital adoption. The analyst expects SLB to generate free cash flow of about $4.2 billion in 2026 and return nearly $4.3 billion in cash to shareholders through $1.7 billion of base dividends and $2.6 billion of buybacks.Jayaram ranks No. 673 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See SLB Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.EOG ResourcesAnother dividend-paying energy company this week is EOG Resources (EOG). The crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG's dividend yield stands at 3.68%. Ahead of Q4 earnings, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The analyst expects EOG to deliver upbeat Q4 results on both operational and financial fronts. Sorbara expects the company to report oil production of 545.7 Mbbls/d (thousand barrels per day), in line with the Street's estimate and within the company's guidance of 542.5 to 547.5 Mbbls/d. Additionally, Sorbara expects total production of 1,369 Mboe/d (million barrels of oil equivalent per day), almost in line with the consensus estimate of 1,371 Mboe/d. The 5-star analyst thinks that investors will focus on EOG's 2026 guidance and early updates on its international projects in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as management's commentary on capital efficiencies in the Utica Shale and Delaware Basin. \"EOG stands out with the potential for peer-leading shareholder returns (at least 70% of FCF returned to shareholders annually) supported by its strong free cash flow generation and best-in-class balance sheet,\" said Sorbara. Specifically, Sorbara expects EOG to make opportunistic buybacks, with $4 billion still available under an existing authorization as of the end of the third quarter of 2025. The analyst estimates $457.4 million in Q4 2025 share buybacks. Including the base dividend, Sorbara estimates $1.0 billion of total capital returns, reflecting 98.4% of EOG's free cash flow.Sorbara ranks No. 511 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.9%. See EOG Resources Technical Analysis on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

    "body": "China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Countries that shunned China during its trade dispute with the U.S. are now sending their leaders to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping — and are keen to strike business deals.At least five national leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, have visited Xi in January alone. Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

    "body": "watch nowThe gap between the best and worse off Americans is growing — and economists don't see an end in sight.The \"K-shaped\" economy has been top of mind for consumers, corporate leaders, policymakers and investors since the Covid pandemic drastically reshaped Americans' financial habits almost six years ago. Economists now warn that this two-speed economic structure is a core feature — rather than a passing fad — within the world's largest economy.\"This is not a cyclical or temporary phenomena,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"This is a structural, fundamental issue.\"The prevailing theory goes something like this: Higher-earning consumers, encouraged by rallying stock holdings and elevated property values, are splashing out on vacations and premium goods. On the other hand, after years of higher-than-ideal inflation rates, lower-income cohorts are struggling to afford necessities such as housing, groceries and gasoline.A luxury airline seat and a value meal.Mensent Photography | Moment | Mario Tama | Getty ImagesTaken together, recent data suggests that bifurcation is as exacerbated as ever.The widening gapA key measure of wealth concentration called the Gini coefficient sits at 60-year highs, according to a report from U.S. Bank published earlier this month. That signaled a reversal of the drop to multidecade lows seen amid the rollout of pandemic-era economic stimulus, said Beth Ann Bovino, the bank's chief economist.The net worth of America's top 1% hit a record share of nearly 32% in the third quarter of 2025, the Federal Reserve reported. By comparison, the bottom 50% cumulatively held 2.5% of overall net wealth.The portion of U.S. GDP heading to workers in the form of compensation tumbled to its lowest level in its more than 75-year history, per data tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means the average nonfarm business worker is seeing an increasingly small slice of an economy that has largely boomed over the last 15 years. This disparity has implications for how — and if — consumers spend their money.For instance, this divergence can explain why airlines are racing to build out luxury offerings at the same time that fast-food companies are leaning on value meals. Households with incomes under $75,000 are allocating less on discretionary categories like travel and experiences than in 2019, while those above $150,000 are allotting more, according to a Bank of America report released last month.Total relative \"outlays\" — a broad measure of spending and nonmortgage payments — by U.S. consumers in the top 20% hit multidecade highs last year, a data analysis conducted by Moody's found. The other 80% tumbled to new lows, the data shows.For that 80%, overall spending hasn't outpaced inflation over the last six years, said Moody's Zandi. That means neither economic quality of life nor spending power has improved for the lion's share of U.S. taxpayers in this timeframe, he said.\"Their standard of living has not budged since the pandemic hit,\" Zandi said. \"It's just disconcerting.\"A 'winner-take-all economy'While the \"K-shape\" term became popularized as an explanation for the uneven economic recovery seen during the pandemic, economists say the origins of this breakaway can be traced back decades earlier.This type of diverging economy stems from the economic reorganization seen during the Reagan administration, according to Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at tax firm RSM. About two decades later, the structural break that created the K-shaped economy, as it's now understood, was more clearly observed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis of the late 2000s, he said.watch nowThat was in part due to the loss of wealth tied to the historic housing market crash, Brusuelas said. On top of that, he said the jump in joblessness limited earnings potential for those without steady employment in their prime working years.The Great Recession \"created the conditions for the winner-take-all economy that emerged in its aftermath,\" said Brusuelas, who first heard the K-shape term around 2008. \"If you live, work and inhabit certain portions of the economy, you might as well live on the dark side of the moon compared to what goes on down-market.\"Zandi pointed to the decline of unionization rates in the late 1900s as another driver of this divergence, given that it led to less negotiating power for workers.When the pandemic took hold in 2020, the stock market tanked and unemployment spiked as corporate America wondered what was coming next. But the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed over 130% since the Covid crisis' onset in March 2020, further boosting the wealth of higher-earning Americans who data shows are more likely to own stocks.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe S&P 500 since March 2020Lower-earners were seen as beneficiaries of pandemic stimulus programs and the subsequent worker shortage that led to outsized wage gains. However, Bank of America found higher-income Americans began seeing stronger wage growth last year. Spending also rose at a faster clip for top earners during much of 2025, data shows.Now, the poorest Americans feel increasingly cast out. The confidence gap between how the highest- and lowest-earners feel about their financial situation compared with five years prior grew to its widest in more than a decade in 2025, according to the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. Michigan's overall sentiment index regained ground in January after tumbling near all-time lows in recent months.This can help explain the success of politicians who center campaigns on affordability. It's been a winning strategy for everyone from President Donald Trump, a Republican, to New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist.New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (L) and US Senator Bernie Sanders join striking Starbucks workers in New York on Dec. 1, 2025. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesThe path forwardLooking ahead, economists expect this inequality to only intensify.Several pointed to Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" — which shrinks programs like Medicaid and food stamps aimed at the poorest citizens — as a driver of further divergence. To make meaningful inroads, the U.S. would instead need to focus on tax reform and expanding social safety nets, according to RSM's Brusuelas.Current White House affordability efforts have had \"limited impact,\" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's head of global markets strategy. But they could ramp up ahead of the November midterm elections, Lakos-Bujas said.Trump has pushed for temporary caps on credit card interest rates and a ban on institutional investors buying homes this year. He claimed last week that the U.S. has \"virtually no inflation,\" though recent data shows price growth remains above the 2% annual rate deemed healthy by the Fed.Beyond politics, economists worry that artificial intelligence will encourage businesses to further slash workforces in an already shaky labor market. Layoffs surged more than 50% in 2025 compared with a year prior, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Amazon, Home Depot and UPS announced job cuts this week.Some have warned against planning on long-term economic growth through the K-shape. Barry Bannister, Stifel's chief equity strategist, called it \"economically unsustainable\" in a note to clients this month. The viability of having better-off consumers accounting for an outsized share of spending makes for \"a good question,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in December.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell speaks at a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on Dec. 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesUltimately, the K-shape illustrates how the U.S. economy is reliant on small pockets of strength in several key areas, Zandi said. Because of that, he said economic growth can feel fragile or fleeting. Health care is the only sector consistently adding jobs in the labor market, Zandi noted. Megacap technology's leadership has propelled the stock market higher over recent years, the economist pointed out. Consumer spending, he said, is driven mostly by the highest earners.\"It doesn't feel like the economy's perched on a strong foundation,\" Zandi said. \"It's perched on a few poles that are sticking up. If one of those poles gets knocked out, then the whole economy gets knocked down.\"",

    "body": "Guests at the Fendi Dallas Highland Park Village Boutique in Dallas, Texas.  Rick Kern | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn today's K-shaped economy, lower-income consumers headed out to shop may be hitting Dollar General or a post-bankruptcy Big Lots, but affluent Americans are increasingly headed for the shopping center private club. Membership clubs are increasingly being seen as retail revitalizers, whether that's in a traditional mall, open-air shopping center, or as a stand-alone commercial real estate tenant. Like their country club cousins, private clubs require monthly dues and often an initiation fee. For instance, Dallas's Highland Park Village, which boasts shops like Hermès, Fendi and Brunello Cucinelli, is also home to Park House, a private club offering fine dining, a wine bar, and art experiences. Resident memberships can be had for a $7,000 initiation fee and annual dues of $292 monthly (a spouse can join for $4,000). The Moore House in Miami's open air Design District has a $5,000 initiation fee and monthly dues over $400. In addition to dining and product curation, it offers overnight accommodations if needed.Data is scarce because they are so new, but R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, says that the popularity of these clubs as part of existing shopping destinations is increasing and tracking with other trends in retail, such as malls that have been increasingly populating themselves with gyms, co-working spaces, and retail clubs with dues replacing discounts as the draw. Both street level retail and malls are discovering that memberships boost business and drive traffic to retail centers like Highland Park Village. \"We have seen an increase in these. They appeal to high-end consumers. The idea is it's another place, a status symbol. It is exclusivity,\" Hottovy said. He added that in the post-Covid era, Placer.ai's research also shows more diners gravitating toward country clubs and fewer to restaurants. Private clubs offer a similar \"safe space\" for people to gather.The clubs, once confined to the coastal elite, are increasingly finding their way into flyover country. The Social House, a club with a $4,000 initiation fee and monthly dues, recently opened adjacent to The Banks, a busy open-air retail area in Cincinnati. A vacant building in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be transformed into The Commerce Club, a private club featuring a cafe, event space, coworking areas, and a speakeasy. Scheduled to open in November 2026, co-founder Jeff Lambert says it will help revitalize an area near downtown. \"The idea is to take a building that has been vacant for over a decade and turn it into a hub of activity,\" Lambert said of the 55,000-square foot space.Lambert, a local developer, was inspired by similar private clubs overseas or in larger U.S. cities, and he says mid-sized cities across the U.S. are seeing the biggest growth in the private club market. Even as recently as five years ago, he says, Grand Rapids would have had trouble supporting a private club, but the entrepreneurial class in the city has reached a critical mass. \"We deserve something like this that you can experience in Madrid, LA, New York and we can support it. We can create an experience that feels metro but that it is very much local,\" Lambert said. The building that the Commerce Club in Grand Rapids will be occupying​.Commerce ClubDevelopers, whether they are in a mall or elsewhere, have strong incentives to embrace membership-based businesses, according to Jia Li, associate professor of marketing at Wake Forest University. \"Many malls face challenges filling vacant anchor spaces or underutilized upper floors. A private club can absorb a large footprint while generating steady and recurring traffic,\" Li said. For high-end malls, private clubs are especially appealing because they allow owners to fill significant space without diluting the brand — and in many cases, enhance it. \"A well-curated, members-only club can reinforce a mall's positioning as an exclusive lifestyle destination, rather than a purely transactional retail center,\" Li said. In some ways, that brings malls full circle to their original social purpose. \"Although today we often associate malls primarily with shopping, early shopping malls in postwar suburban America were explicitly envisioned as 'community and civic centers,' not merely retail machines,\" Li said.Daniel Spiegel, senior vice president and managing director at Coldwell Banker Commercial, says while the private club concept has decades of history, they are gaining new traction. \"Private social and dining clubs were very popular from the 1950s through the 1990s, and we may be seeing a comeback in different forms,\" Spiegel said. In some cases, fitness clubs, co-working concepts, and social spaces which recently were common in office properties are now taking space in retail centers. Some of the spaces Coldwell Banker represents are in very typical malls like Scottsdale, Arizona's Fashion Square, where clubs like Industrious serve as combination work and social spaces.\"These membership-based operators offer landlords attractive characteristics like longer-term leases, consistent foot traffic during off-peak hours, and members with discretionary income that benefits the surrounding tenants,\" Spiegel said. The build-out costs can be substantial, and the economics need to work in markets with sufficient density and demographics. \"But it reflects a broader shift where successful retail properties are becoming destinations that offer experiences beyond traditional shopping,\" he added.Why landlords and consumers are both clubbingIn recent years, retail landlords have pursued many options for empty square footage and to increase foot traffic, from conversion to housing to a greater focus on experiences, to even mega-churches as tenants. Sam Vise, CEO and co-founder at Optimum Retailing — and also a member of New York City-based private club Soho House — says clubs are becoming more attractive to developers looking to boost traffic to their properties because while a typical mall anchor store might bring a customer in a couple of times a week, a private club can bring customers to the same property multiple times a week. \"As malls and retail centers rethink their role post-ecommerce, these clubs introduce a built-in, high-frequency customer who values experience, community, and time spent on site – all things traditional retail has struggled to deliver on its own,\" Vise said. In addition to landlords looking for tenants that generate repeat visits, younger consumers prioritizing social connection over pure consumption and transactional footfall are driving the trend. \"It creates a reason to return weekly, sometimes daily, and that spillover benefits surrounding food, wellness, and retail concepts,\" Vise said. He added that the club trend is already opening doors for digitally native brands and emerging concepts to test physical retail in high-engagement environments through buzz-generating pop-ups. \"When executed well, private social clubs act as a catalyst, raising the bar for how surrounding retail engages customers and drives repeat visits,\" Vise said. The downside is that these clubs don't automatically translate to broader accessibility. \"Retailers nearby need to be intentional about how they engage — aligning assortment, service, and in-store experience with a customer who expects curation and hospitality, not just convenience,\" Vise added. Clubs are prone to their own boom and bust cycles. Some of the most well-known club brands, including Soho House, have seen mixed results from recent expansion attempts. Since a 2021 initial public offering, Soho House has pursued plans to open more locations, including across the U.S. Now it is being taken private at a similar valuation to its five-year-old IPO price.Andrew Carnie, chief executive officer of Soho House & Co., at Soho House Dean Street in London, UK, on Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023.Jose Sarmento | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate clubs do bring to retail centers something in addition to cachet that is coveted: dwell time. \"The more amount of time a human being stays on a property, the more money they will spend,\" said Charlie Koniver, a principal at Odyssey Retail Advisors, a New York City-based real estate consultant which works with luxury and contemporary retailers in creating upscale shopping destinations.A members-only club can act as a commercial real estate anchor, but Koniver says the clubs aren't a fit for every mall or retail center. A private club isn't necessarily a good candidate for an empty Sears box, and they often make for more appealing stand-alone retail destinations. The clubs tend to have smaller footprints, and when they are in malls or retail villages, they are seen as upscale mainstay tenants. \"When they are part of the retail environment, they tend to be ones that don't have traditional anchors,\" Koniver said. The private club phenomenon is an extension of a consumer need that has existed all along, according to Greg Zakowicz, an ecommerce and retail advisor at Omnisend. \"Let's not forget that high-end shoppers are often members of other private clubs, such as golf and swim clubs, and even airport lounges. Now brands are taking that model and applying it to retail by providing curated products and experiences in a high-end, private setting,\" Zakowicz said. In the current economic environment, with upper-income households continuing to spend, even as middle- and lower-income households reduce discretionary spending, it becomes even more important to capture these customers, Zakowicz said. But he doesn't believe this is critical across the retail landscape. \"With retail, styles and preferences change, and concepts like this are sure to evolve with them. But that's OK. I don't think retailers need to have them be sustainable in the long term to survive,\" he added.David Loranger, assistant professor of fashion marketing and merchandising at Sacred Heart University, says the phenomenon is probably a byproduct of the K-shaped economy, with many Americans holding stock portfolios and in professional lines of work able to afford luxuries. But he suggests there is perhaps a bit of a political persuasion in the private club trend, too. There is the MAGA-friendly Executive Branch which opened last year on the bottom level of the Georgetown Mall outside of Washington D.C.  The club was co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and is by invitation only. \"It might also be some type of Mar-a-Lago halo effect where those who see themselves in (or aspire to) the echelon of Trump, Bezos, and other CEO-types are becoming interested in belonging to such a club,\" Loranger said.watch now",

    "body": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is on the launch pad carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet network satellites, which are expected to eventually rival Elon Musk's Starlink system, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 9, 2025.Steve Nesius | ReutersAmazon has asked the Federal Communications Commission for more time to meet a deadline that requires the company to deploy roughly 1,600 internet satellites by July 2026. The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a New York City subway station, in New York, U.S., Jan. 14, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersAmazon's \"Melania\" earned $7 million at the domestic box office during its debut this weekend, the highest opening for a non-music documentary in more than a decade.Documentaries are not typically major ticket sales drivers, with the majority of releases over the last 10 years opening under $5 million and grossing $10 million to $20 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Documentaries and concert films by popular musical artists often outperform these numbers because of their built-in fan bases.Notably, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" retains the record for the highest-opening political documentary with $23.9 million. The film, which opened in 2004, also holds the record for the highest domestic haul for a political documentary with $119 million.\"We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for 'Melania' exceeding our expectations,\" said Kevin Wilson, head of domestic theatrical distribution at Amazon MGM Studios. \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"The Melania Trump documentary was acquired by the tech giant, which operates the streaming service Prime Video, for an estimated $40 million, and reports suggest the company spent nearly the same price tag on marketing for the film.Ticket sales were driven by women and moviegoers over 55, with both demographics accounting for 70% or more of receipts. Additionally, rural theaters represented 46% of total box office grosses, according to EntTelligence data. Typically, these theaters, which operate in areas with populations of fewer than 500,000 people, account for around 30% of movie ticket sales.EntTelligence estimates that 600,000 moviegoers saw the film over the weekend.While review sites have been flooded with strong audience reviews — Rotten Tomatoes' \"Popcornmeter\" stands at 99% from more than 500 users — critical responses were more scathing. \"Melania\" holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 19 reviews, with many critics calling the documentary \"propaganda.\"Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes and CNBC.",

Because it was smart.\"In 1992, the Queens, New York, native co-founded the clothing brand — an acronym for \"For Us, By Us\" — following a humble upbringing with his single mom. John launched the company with just $40, and the money he made as a waiter at the chain restaurant helped keep him afloat and invest in his business.\"That job taught me sales and inventory, paid my bills [and] bought fabric and materials for my business,\" wrote John, 56.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsFUBU rose to popularity in the early 1990s alongside a flourishing hip-hop and rap scene.

In 1996, he put out an ad seeking funding for his business and landed a distribution deal with Samsung, he told Business Insider in February 2018.

Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

    "body": "Pharma giant AstraZeneca will list on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, days after it announced big commitments on the other side of the world.Like the rest of Big Pharma, the company has a balancing act. It wants a close relationship with the U.S., its biggest market, and the listing is intended to boost investment there.Meanwhile, innovation-friendly China is attracting pharma companies that urgently need to develop new medicines to replace blockbuster drugs whose patents are set to expire in the next few years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. add to the pressure.AstraZeneca has announced it's investing billions in China and partnering with a Chinese biotech on weight-loss drugs, just before its shares list in the U.S on Monday.The developments come at a critical time for the pharma industry as companies are increasingly looking east for innovation to replace the revenue of current blockbuster medicines going off patent in the next couple of years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. market, which accounts for the bulk of profits for most big pharma companies, are adding to the pressure on Big Pharma.China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Thursday, AstraZeneca said it plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030 to expand both manufacturing and research and development, as Keir Starmer became the first UK prime minister to visit the country for eight years.\"These investments span the value chain, from drug discovery and clinical development to manufacturing, and bring Chinese innovation to the world,\" the company said, while highlighting a flurry of other partnerships with other biotechs in the region.In a separate announcement on Friday, the UK's largest company would partner up with Hong Kong-listed CSPC Pharmaceuticals to strengthen its obesity portfolio. The collaboration agreement includes eight of CSPC's preclinical and early-stage programs, including a once-monthly injectable. CSP stock fell 10.2% on the announcement. AstraZeneca will pay CSPC $1.2 billion upfront, and an additional $17.3 billion if certain regulatory, research and sales milestones are met, an AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Friday. The company declined to comment further on its geographic priorities. watch nowThe announcements came just before the listing of AstraZeneca shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, as well as its recently announced $50 billion U.S. investment to waive off U.S. pharma tariffs.\"What we can discern from this is that the US and China will be the two most important regions for the company for the foreseeable future,\" Camilla Oxhamre, portfolio manager at Rhenman & Partners, told CNBC via email.AstraZeneca's balancing actThe U.S. is AstraZeneca's by far largest market, and the company said last year it would end its American depositary shares program to pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, keeping its listings also in London and Stockholm, saying it wanted a more global investor base.\"It's the largest pharma company [in China] and when they decide to list in the U.S., there would always be a question about the commitment in the minds of some to China, and the fact that they had a few investigations last year,\" HSBC's Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research, told CNBC. In 2025, Astrazeneca faced several probes by Chinese regulators into unpaid import duties.\"So they are, in effect, telling you very clearly that they are committed to China by this action,\" Kumar added.China is also AstraZeneca's second-largest market. Oxhamre, whose fund has a large long position in Astra, added that the Chinese market would \"continue to grow in importance over time, both in terms of revenue and research.\"And Astra isn't the only pharma company looking to China for new, innovative assets. London-listed GSK inked a deal with Hengrui Pharma worth up to $12 billion in July, most of it tied to achieving certain development and commercial milestones.China's hot biotech sceneLicensing deals between Big Pharma and Chinese biotechs, like the one between AstraZeneca and CSPC, have increased sharply in recent years, with 57 such deals in 2025, according to Biopharma Dive data. \"These deals demonstrate the success of China's long-running effort to move up the biopharma value chain, from fast followers to differentiated assets that can compete globally,\" said PitchBook analysts in a report published last month.Read moreChina's emergence as a leader in preclinical and early-stage development comes as biotech funding elsewhere has suffered in recent years, and is helped by the speed at which early human trials can be conducted there. A reverse brain drain, where Chinese scientists are returning to the country, is also helping the country's biotech sector, according to Kumar.\"China's biopharma sector has reshaped itself around next-generation therapeutics paired with efficient clinical-trial infrastructure to de-risk these assets,\" the PitchBook analysts said.\"Multinational and mid-cap biopharma companies are sourcing assets from China at growing rates, spanning both headline megadeals and smaller licensing deals. Importantly, this activity is skewing toward complex biologics rather than legacy modalities.\"A Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs report from June suggested \"China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States in biotechnology\" and that this could \"quickly shift the global balance of power.\"But late 2025 saw a meaningful pickup in U.S. biotech funding.\"There will always be innovation coming from both geographies,\" Kumar said. \"The world has changed… China was catching up with the U.S., [the] U.S. will re-accelerate.\"— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report",

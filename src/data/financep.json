    "body": "watch nowFormer Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh on Friday vaulted to the front of the pack in the race for central bank chair following remarks from President Donald Trump, according to a closely watched prediction market.Traders on Kalshi pushed Warsh well ahead of the person seen as his closest competitor, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.In remarks delivered Friday morning, Trump, without explicitly stating his decision, said he'd prefer to keep Hassett in his position as top economic advisor.\"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today,\" Trump said during remarks in the White House. \"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.\"After Trump spoke, traders on Kalshi raised their bets to a 59% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared to just 14% for Hassett. Even current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, considered a longshot for position, pulled ahead of Hassett, with an 18% chance.As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh leading Hassett 58% to 11% and Waller at 16%. Traders are giving little odds to BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, the other two candidates considered finalists. Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Powell's term as chair ends in May.Turning to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, \"We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaks during an interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Oct. 30, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Thursday the giant Wall Street investment bank is actively exploring opportunities in prediction markets, signaling growing institutional interest in a corner of finance that has gained increased traction among traders.\"The prediction markets are also super interesting,\" Solomon said on Goldman's fourth-quarter earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. \"I personally met with the two big prediction companies and their leadership in the last two weeks and spent a couple of hours with each to learn more about that. We have a team of people here that are spending time with them and are looking at it.\"Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket allow investors to trade contracts tied to the outcome of world events, ranging from elections and economic data releases to policy decisions. Goldman's interest comes as prediction markets gain visibility amid debates over market transparency and regulatory boundaries.Some platforms operate under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a distinction that Solomon said makes the products look increasingly similar to traditional financial instruments.\"When you think about some of these activities, particularly when you look at some of the ones that are CFTC regulated, they look like derivative contract activities,\" said the 63-year old CEO, who's led Goldman since 2018. \"So I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business.\"Still, Solomon struck a note of caution on timing, pushing back on expectations that Wall Street's embrace of prediction markets will be rapid.\"I think there's a lot of reason to be excited and interested in these things,\" he said. \"But the pace of change might not be as quick and as immediate as some of the pundits are talking about. But I think they're important, real. And we're spending a lot of time.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship. ",

    "body": "A U.S. move to seize Greenland could damage trade ties with the European Union, France's finance minister has warned, as one analyst told CNBC that tariffs or economic sanctions could lead to a \"trade war.\"U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up talk of annexing Greenland this month — and has not ruled out taking it by force. Talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday over the future of the world's largest island ended without a diplomatic breakthrough.French Finance Minister Roland Lescure told the Financial Times on Friday that economic ties between the U.S. and Europe could be damaged if Trump were to move to take the self-governing Danish territory. \"Greenland is a sovereign part of a sovereign country that is part of the EU. That shouldn't be messed around [with],\" he said.watch nowWhen asked whether the EU would hit the U.S. with economic sanctions if it invaded Greenland, Lescure told FT: \"I'm not going there. I mean, obviously, if that happened, we would be in a totally new world for sure, and we would have to adapt accordingly.\"His comments come as a Democratic-led U.S. delegation is expected to visit Copenhagen for talks with Danish MPs on Friday.Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. Analysts told CNBC that he wants to keep rivals out of emerging trade routes and, potentially, mining of minerals that are critical in industries like defense. \"Significant\" economic pressure in the form of tariffs or sanctions on Denmark by the U.S. \"could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S. as well as constant headline risks,\" Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email.\"This would rattle markets,\" he said. \"It would also call into question NATO, though we don't predict this happening, or NATO breaking apart. Domestic political and markets pushback would likely moderate any such pushes by the Trump administration.\"Read moreMeanwhile, European troops arrived in Greenland late Thursday for a collaborative military exercise. This shows the U.S. that \"this is primarily an allied effort,\" Maria Martisiute, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. \"If we want to reinforce veterans and defense in Greenland or the wider Arctic, it's not up to the U.S. It can be done via allied efforts.\"The exercise, combined with European leaders outlining their non-negotiable red lines, can \"send a powerful message,\" she said, adding: \"It remains to be seen how the U.S. will proceed in that regard.\"The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed to double its spending on Greenland in its latest draft budget.\"What is clear is that Greenland can count on us — politically, economically, and financially and when it comes to its security,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "watch nowArtificial intelligence coding startup Replit is now letting users create and publish mobile apps for Apple devices using only natural language prompts, the latest evolution in so-called vibe coding. Additionally, Replit is nearing a new round of funding that would value the startup at $9 billion, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC.The Mobile Apps on Replit feature, introduced on Thursday, allows creators and small-business owners to go from idea to working app in minutes, and to the App Store in days, the company said in a blog post Thursday. Replit is also integrating the feature with Stripe, enabling users to monetize their apps. The move is a step forward in the AI-powered coding space, offering consumers a highly accessible use case that goes beyond what bigger players like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google currently offer. For example, if a stock trader tells the agent to \"build an app that tracks the top 10 public companies by market cap,\" Replit generates the mobile app, complete with a functioning interface, and gives users a way to preview and test the app. Vibe coding is one of the most pervasive trends to emerge from the generative AI boom, and the momentum has continued to pick up to start 2026. That's largely thanks to Claude Code, a product from Anthropic, which has gone viral in tech circles. In December, Anthropic announced that Claude Code reached $1 billion in annualized revenue in six months. In September, Replit was valued at about $3 billion in a fundraising round. The hottest company in the space is Cursor creator Anysphere, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November. Lovable, Europe's leading player, was recently valued at $6.6 billion. As more vibe-coding products come online, software stocks, already beaten down in the AI era, could see further erosion. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, which counts Salesforce, Adobe and ServiceNow among its top 10 constituents, has fallen 11% in the last three months as investors grow concerned about the risk from AI agent and coding products. Before publishing a Replit-powered app, users have to submit it for review to Apple, which has notoriously strict App Store guidelines and user data agreements. According to Apple, 90% of submissions are reviewed in less than 24 hours. Vibe-coded software has come under fire recently for security flaws. A new study from cybersecurity startup Tenzai found that popular AI-coding agents, including Replit and Claude Code, consistently ship apps with critical vulnerabilities, such as failing to prevent cyberattacks or password brute force attacks.If you're interested, take a look at the Replit sites that the TechCheck team vibe coded and published:Market Bling, tracking the top companies by market capPattern Haven, a community for sewists WATCH: Google's vibe-coding playwatch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures before boarding Air Force One en route to Detroit, Michigan, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Friday will push the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in large part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. President Donald Trump wants PJM to hold an emergency auction in which the tech companies would bid on contracts for new electricity generation, a White House official told CNBC. Trump wants PJM to build $15 billion of new baseload power generation, the official said. He also wants PJM to cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, the official said. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and governors from the mid-Atlantic region will announce an agreement Friday morning urging PJM to take these actions, the official said. \"Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading a unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.  Bloomberg first reported the news. Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. The power shortage makes blackouts more likely, said Abe Silverman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 to 2023 under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" Silverman said.",

    "body": "The Nave Photon, carrying crude oil from Venezuela, is docked at Port Freeport in Freeport, Texas, U.S., January 15, 2026.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThe U.S. is securing about 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday, as the country has started selling oil from the Latin American nation after capturing its former President Nicolas Maduro.Washington has completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson, with more expected in the coming days and weeks.\"We're getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,\" Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event, without specifying prices.U.S. special forces captured Maduro earlier this month during an operation that Washington said was aimed at restoring political stability.President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuela would hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil currently under U.S. sanctions, which would be sold at prevailing market prices. In a social media post, he noted that the proceeds would be controlled by him to ensure the funds benefit both Venezuela and the U.S.That would just be the first tranche of oil, as the Department of Energy has said the oil sales from Venezuela will continue \"indefinitely.\"Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude reserves at about 303 billion barrels, but years of underinvestment have left its oil industry in severe decline, with output now around 800,000 barrels per day from a peak of 3.5 million bpd in the 1990s. Trump also announced last Friday that oil companies would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector, adding that the U.S. would provide security to ensure investors earn strong returns. He met oil industry leaders from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero and Maratho at the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.  Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.The developments come as global oil markets face a supply overhang that has weighed on prices in the past year. Brent futures inched 0.14% higher to $63.85 a barrel as of 8:33 p.m. ET, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $59.31. This follows a sharp fall on Thursday as traders appear to brush off tensions between U.S. and Iran. \"Venezuela's oil problem is not technical, and it is not commercial,  it's fundamentally human and political,\" said Baron Lamarre, former head of trading at Petronas and co-founder of Index.\"Until investors have confidence in long-term political continuity, capital will remain cautious, incremental, and conditional,\" he said.",

    "body": "CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is interviewed for CNBC in the Russell Senate office building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 15, 2026. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersSenators are vowing to go forward on a major crypto bill that would give the industry the rule of the road after a planned committee vote was derailed at the 11th hour. But the biggest sticking points have been issues for months as Democrats, Republican, the crypto industry and banks have tried to find common ground. The likelihood that the latest version of the bill, which was released late Monday, would be able to get the approval of the Banking Committee was already tenuous when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that Coinbase would not be able to support the bill, listing several concerns including a reduced role for the CFTC and limits on the ability for crypto to offer consumers rewards in the bill.. \"It was the 1,000th cut in a death by 1000 cuts,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis told CNBC of Armstrong's tweet. A few hours after Armstrong publicly opposed the bill, Banking Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., formally called off the hearing, postponing it to a yet-to-be-announced date.  Armstrong told CNBC that after a new version of the bill was dropped late Monday night, he was surprised by some of the provisions in it. By the time Coinbase's team identified key areas of concern, it was too late for any changes to be made in a markup. \"We've got a chance to do a new draft and hopefully get back into a markup in a few weeks,\" Armstrong said.  Lummis, said it could take until February or March to re-hold the vote.  \"I feel like I got run over by a Mack truck,\" said Lummis, one of the biggest crypto proponents on Capitol Hill who has worked on similar legislation for years. \"But we'll get back at it after this break and find some ways to fix the bill.\" One of the biggest debates around the bill deals with the rewards that companies can offer stablecoin holders. Under the stablecoin law, crypto exchanges cannot offer customers interest on stablecoin – however they can offer rewards that act like interest. Banks have said the language could lead to hundreds of billions being moved from deposits to stablecoin – one Fed report suggests there could be a credit squeeze of hundreds of billion to as much as $1.2 trillion if stablecoin can offer interest.  Armstrong said he would like to speak with bank CEOs directly on this, but argued that the bill needed to treat both industries equally.  \"Crypto companies should be allowed to compete and offer loans just like banks,\" he said. Banks are also preparing to fight for more favorable language. More than 3,000 banks signed a petition lead by the American Bankers Association warning that allowing crypto to offer interest-like rewards \"will siphon trillions from local lending, leaving less money available for car loans, agricultural loans, mortgages, and small business borrowing that drive local economies.\" Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., said she's spoken with representatives from the banking and crypto industries, and she thinks if there is more time to negotiate, an agreement can be reached soon.\"Everyone agrees that there has to be a compromise somewhere in there, and making sure that we are allowing the innovation to grow,\" she said.Caleigh Keating contributed to this article.

Mitsubishi agreed to buy Aethon Energy Management LLC's US gas and pipeline assets for $5.2 billion, the biggest purchase by a Japanese company in the American shale sector. Photographer: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, \"from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,\" the company said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

Bryan Derballa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmpire Wind will resume construction off the coast of New York, after a federal judge on Thursday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. The preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carl J. Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is the latest setback for President Donald Trump's efforts to stop offshore wind projects. Equinor, the Norwegian company developing Empire Wind, said it \"will now focus on safely restarting construction activities that were halted during the suspension period.\"\"In addition, the project will continue to engage with the U.S. government to ensure the safe, secure and responsible execution of its operations,\" Equinor said in a statement Thursday. The Department of Interior halted five wind projects off the East Coast, including Empire Wind, on Dec. 22 claiming national security concerns. Equinor in its lawsuit called the suspension \"the latest unlawful action\" by the Trump administration to stop the development of offshore wind.Empire Wind is expected to generate electricity for more than 500,000 homes by 2027, according to Equinor. It will provide power to New York City through a substation in Brooklyn. The other projects targeted by Trump are Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, and Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England. A federal judge on Monday allowed Revolution Wind to resume construction. A hearing on the suspension of Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m. ET at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Norfolk. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, owned by Dominion Energy, is the largest project of its kind in the U.S. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (right) and C.C. Wei, chief executive officer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (left), shake hands during an announcement of an additional $100 billion into TSMC's U.S. manufacturing at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S., on March 3, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBuoyed by yet another blockbuster earnings report and a new U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is poised to accelerate its multibillion-dollar expansion in Arizona. The world's largest contract chipmaker has already committed $165 billion in the U.S., aligning with Washington's push to rebuild its domestic chip manufacturing. But TSMC executives have signaled that spending will rise even further as the company expands capacity to meet demand for artificial intelligence chips.Speaking Thursday with CNBC's Emily Tan, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said the firm would continue to ramp up its investments in Arizona.\"We have strong conviction on the AI mega trend, and that is the reason we are stepping up the capital expenditures to expand in Taiwan and in the U.S.,\" Huang said. \"Not just to expand, but also try to accelerate where it is possible to satisfy or narrow the gap.\"The comments came just hours after Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said on the company's quarterly earnings call that TSMC had recently purchased additional land in Arizona and planned to build a \"gigafab cluster\" in the state. While the company did not disclose the dollar value of its planned expansions in the U.S., it forecast capital expenditure in the new year to increase over 30% at the midpoint compared with 2025. Trade deal timing The Arizona expansion coincides with a U.S.-Taiwan trade deal signed Thursday that caps U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods at 15%, down from 20%, without stacking on existing rates. Under the agreement, Taiwanese firms commit $250 billion in direct U.S. investments across semiconductors, AI and related sectors, along with $250 billion in credit guarantees to strengthen supply chains. The deal also grants favorable treatment for chips, supporting efforts to reshore manufacturing to the U.S.It demonstrates that our manufacturing excellence can be repeated in the U.S.Wendell HuangChief Financial Officer, TSMCU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the goal of the trade deal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S.Ahead of TSMC's earnings release and the trade deal, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Taiwanese chip giant had been planning a significant expansion in Arizona as part of trade negotiations between the U.S. and Taiwan, citing confidential sources. However, on Thursday, Huang denied that its U.S. investment plans were directly tied to those trade talks.\"The [U.S.-Taiwan] trade deal is between two governments, and we are not part of the discussions,\" he said. \"But what I will say is we are continuing to invest and accelerate our investment in Arizona because of customers' demand, and we actually are making very good progress with our [first fab] in Arizona being up and running. U.S. progress The push to expand follows progress at its current U.S. facility following years of delays and concerns.According to executives, TSMC's first fabrication plant, which has already begun mass production, is now producing chips with yields and technology levels comparable to those of the company's leading facilities in Taiwan. \"It demonstrates that our manufacturing excellence can be repeated in the U.S. It's very meaningful for ourselves, and it's also very meaningful for our customers,\" Huang said.However, he noted that the company's most advanced technologies would continue to be developed and scaled up in Taiwan, where TSMC benefits from the necessary collaboration between its research teams and manufacturing operations.watch nowProfit margins in Taiwan also remain higher than in the U.S., partly due to lower labor costs.Still, the company's outlook in the U.S. has improved. TSMC has moved up the production timeline for its second Arizona plant to the second half of 2027, with construction on a third facility accelerating this year. It has also begun applying for permits for a fourth plant, the company said at its recent earnings call.According to Huang, TSMC's original plan for its first 1,100 acres in Arizona included six wafer fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development center. However, that land proved to be insufficient for the expansion plans, prompting the purchase of an additional 900-acre lot. Some facilities that were part of the original plan will now be built on this second piece of land instead, with the remainder \"used for future flexibilities,\" Huang said. TSMC shares were trading up more than 3% in Taipei on Friday.",

    "body": "Amazon package and Saks Fifth Avenue bag.Getty ImagesAmazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store \"burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year\" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \"Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.\"As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. Amazon wrote that it \"hopes\" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may \"seek more drastic remedies\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.Amazon and Saks both declined to comment beyond what they stated in filings.Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. Correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly quoted the Amazon filing. watch now",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 12, 2026.Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesThe first two weeks of 2026 have seen U.S. President Donald Trump's administration capture Venezuela's president, threaten to respond to Iran's violent crackdown on protests, and talk up the possibility of using force to seize Greenland. So why are stocks rising?The headlines have caused price swings in asset classes like gold, silver and oil as traders sought safe havens and weighed the impact a U.S. intervention in the Middle East could have on oil supply.Read moreEquity markets, however, appear to be shrugging off the news. The S&P 500 has had just three losing sessions since markets began the new trading year, and was up around 1.5% year-to-date at Thursday's close. Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, where the tensions hit much closer to home, have also risen, as have Asia-Pacific stocks.The U.S. view Wall Street's three major averages have made gains despite the news, appearing to shrug off U.S. President Donald Trump's apparent willingness to order military operations overseas and threats to take territory from a close ally by force.Alongside the S&P 500's gain, Wall Street's two other major averages are up this year: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added close to 3%, while tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 1.2%. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for Chicago-based Northern Trust Wealth Management, which manages assets worth $492.6 billion, said markets hadn't been moved by Trump's actions and rhetoric on Iran, Venezuela, and Greenland partly because no other large economic or military powers had responded.\"Markets are looking at these events in isolation, and it would likely take a unique response to each flare-up to drive more market agita,\" he told CNBC in an email. \"We don't want to speculate what subsequent actions may follow, but what we would be concerned with beyond the human conditions in a given region would be if lines are drawn that impact trade in an increasingly sequestered world.\"watch nowA U.S. Supreme Court ruling is due soon on the legality of Trump's tariffs, but, in the meantime, global investors appear to have adapted to the White House's 2025 pivots, Freedman said.\"Increased flare ups beyond what has occurred already could push countries to revisit trade ties or threaten sanctions, but until they arrive, markets will remain in more reactive mode if an event happens and not necessarily adjust portfolio positioning now in anticipation of an event,\" he added. \"If markets were leaning into prescriptive positioning or the thought that taking defensive measures was appropriate because flare-up probabilities were increasing, we would likely see a weaker U.S. dollar.\"The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major rivals, has risen by around 1% since the beginning of the year.Equity market 'meh' Alex Morris, CEO of Washington, D.C.-headquartered F/m Investments, called stock market investors' reactions \"equity market 'meh'.\"\"Geopolitics are simmering, but not boiling over,\" he said. \"The president's use of highly targeted shows of force but low-time and personnel in-theater operations leaves markets little to react to. \"Short-lived and final events (no ongoing commitment) give little for markets to react to. News happens and that's it. It also helps there has been no meaningful response from Iran or Venezuela.\"Morris argued that the market's muted reaction was underpinned by a \"growing inurement\" to what the Trump says, and increasingly, to what he does. watch now\"Despite substantial action, there is little the president is unwilling to immediately backtrack on and much of the flood the zone action has been undone or overturned,\" he added. \"The market has learned to temper enthusiasm and wait for receipts.\"Anthony Esposito, founder and CEO of AscalonVI Capital, said markets have not cared to discount geopolitical risk for some time now.\"Israel bombs Iran – the S&P 500 was down 1% overnight and closed down just 50bps. U.S. bombs Iran – almost no reaction,\" he told CNBC.\"Venezuela, Greenland could be seen as positives for the markets and even GDP in the U.S., [but] with no regard for the what ifs,\" he said, noting that energy production, rare earth procurement, national security and infrastructure expansion were all at play.Security forces are seen during a pro-government rally on Jan. 12, 2026 in Tehran, Iran. Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"Iran is the wild card,\" he added, saying the market slid earlier this week \"until Trump settled fears,\" by seeming to back away from military action. \"If there was an event in Iran the market would react (oil up, stocks down, gold up) but aside from that the markets are focused on rates, growth, earnings and the Trump agenda.\"European rallyStocks in Europe have also strengthened even amid questions about the future of Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory in the Arctic, and what Trump's determination to take the island could mean for NATO and continental defense. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has added almost 4%.\"Bottom line, there is a lot of issues but as yet, they haven't created an impact via investor sentiment or activity,\" said Toni Meadows, head of investment at U.K.-based BRI Wealth Management.\"This might not always be the case,\" he added. \"Greenland is [the] bigger deal in terms of impact as this is an argument within NATO, so if at some point the market believes Trump's threat to make it a military conflict then markets will react,\" he said. \"But for now, it is a case of stay close to the news flow.\"Benjamin Jones, global head of research at Invesco, told CNBC in an email that historically, geopolitics, military conflicts, and unconventional policy haven't weighed on portfolios as much as investors fear. Markets are callous and only react meaningfully when these events impact economic fundamentals or lead to a change in policy.Benjamin JonesGlobal Head of Research at Invesco\"Many geopolitical events are troubling, but markets are callous and only react meaningfully and sustainably when these events impact economic fundamentals or lead to a change in policy,\" he said. \"History is clear, equity markets have historically performed well in the 12 months following a spike in geopolitical risk.\"Asian stocks on the riseIn fact, the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index, which tracks large and mid-cap stocks across 15 Asia-Pacific countries, has risen over 5% this year to a record high. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi similarly reached all-time highs in recent days.Market watchers said the increases are not investors being complacent, but fundamentals like the absence of major oil shocks and the expectation that easier monetary policy and AI spending will continue to underpin earnings growth.\"The impact of geopolitical events would usually transmit to global markets via the oil price but the oil market is not seeing significant shocks so far,\" said Yap Fook Hien, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered.A tee shirt saying \"Greenland is not for sale\" is on display in a shop in Nuuk, Greenland, on January 15, 2026. Alessandro Rampazzo | Afp | Getty ImagesYap added that Asian investors and global equity markets are driven more by policy stimulus, including U.S. rate cuts and AI investments, all of which support a strong outlook for earnings growth this year.\"Geopolitics remain a key risk but the shock since Liberation Day in April 2025 has conditioned markets to respond more calmly to Trump's actions,\" he said.Morningstar's Southeast Asia managing director, Shihan Abeyguna, told CNBC that markets may now view geopolitics as \"a chronic risk rather than an acute shock.\"He added that Asia valuations are not stretched enough to make markets vulnerable to prolonged drawdowns without a genuine shock.Geopolitical concerns in the region \"tend to be more calibrated, so it would need to be a true unexpected shock that would alter earnings expectations,\" said Abeyguna.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI sent a letter Thursday to investors and banking partners warning that it expects Elon Musk to make \"deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims\" as his lawsuit against the AI lab heads to trial in April. The trial will mark a public escalation of Musk's years-long feud with OpenAI, and the company's letter serves as an attempt to preempt and alleviate investors' concerns. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from venture capitalists, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion.Musk co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company in 2015 alongside several other researchers and executives, including the startup's CEO Sam Altman. He filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in 2024 alleging he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after the AI company explored converting to a for-profit entity and established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft.  Musk departed OpenAI's board in 2018, but he has argued that he is owed \"the value of all intellectual property developed\" from his contributions, potentially amounting to billions of dollars, according to a complaint.  \"We have strong defenses and feel confident about our chances of winning the case,\" OpenAI said in the letter, which was viewed by CNBC. \"Regardless, based on the record so far, we believe this case is worth no more than the $38M that Elon donated - though that is not a guarantee.\" OpenAI declined to comment on the letter.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that the case will proceed to trial. The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California.OpenAI said it expects Musk will make comments about the AI company that are not \"grounded in reality\" and are \"typical of the harassment tactics he's previously deployed,\" according to the letter.  \"Elon's lawsuit remains baseless and without merit, and our team is focused on ensuring the jury sees these claims for what they are,\" OpenAI said.WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures ‘continue to produce all-time highs’watch now",

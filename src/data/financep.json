    "body": "In November, AirHelp, a service that helps airline passengers claim compensation for flight disruptions, released its annual ranking of the best U.S. airlines. To determine the ranking, the organization looked at on-time performance, claim processing and customer experience — analyzing data from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025. Each airline was given a score out of 10.According to the report, AirHelp considered an on-time flight to be \"any flight that arrived within 15 minutes of its published arrival time.\" For claim processing, the organization assessed each airline based on how they treat their customers when things go wrong. And for the customer experience category, passengers were asked to give their opinion on five factors: cabin crew, aircraft comfort, aircraft cleanliness, food and entertainment.To ensure AirHelp's database ranks among the most accurate available, the company says they cross-reference their statistics with a variety of sources, including airport databanks, flight-tracking vendors, and government agencies. 2025 was a challenging year for U.S. airlines, Eric Napoli, Chief Legal Officer at AirHelp, tells CNBC Make It. The government shutdown that lasted a little over a month, had a significant impact on air traffic and travel, he says.For example, on-time performance really took a hit, he says: \"We saw that operational challenge this year.\"According to Napoli, American, United, and Delta work fairly well with AirHelp to make sure that customers who file claims — flight cancellations, lost baggage — get paid. But it's still an area they can improve in, he adds. \"Different airlines have their own operational modes but with claims processing, they should make it less difficult for customers to actually claim what's due to them under law,\" he says.American Airlines is the best U.S. airline for on-time performance, customer satisfaction and moreWith a score of 7.64, American Airlines is the best U.S. airline, AirHelp says. On the company's global ranking, American Airlines came in at No. 11. The airline had a score of 7.1 for on-time performance, 8 for customer opinion and 7.8 for claim processing. Napoli says that American Airlines beat out both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines because it was better in one key category. \"They weren't as efficient and quick in claims processing as they were before, but they did outdo United Airlines,\" he says. \"They were able to get passengers their compensation quicker.\" American AirlinesGrant Baldwin | Getty ImagesAmerican is one of the world's largest airlines. It serves more than 300 destinations and operates a fleet of over 900 aircraft. The airline was a pioneer in loyalty programs, launching its frequent flyer program in 1979. American Airlines is also a founding member of the Oneworld alliance, which includes other partner airlines worldwide like British Airways, and Qatar Airways.The best U.S. airlines for on-time performance and moreAmerican Airlines – 7.64United Airlines – 7.54Delta Airlines – 7.46Frontier Airlines – 7.07Hawaiian Airlines –  6.73Southwest – 6.68Alaska Airlines – 5.95JetBlue – 5.31United Airlines is the No. 2 U.S. airline, according to AirHelp. It received a score of 7.54 and took 13th place in the global ranking. It got a score of 7.4 for on-time performance, 8.1 for customer opinion and 7.2 for claim processing. Napoli says United performed better than the rest in on-time performance and customer opinion, but ultimately fell short in the claim processing category.  United AirlinesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines serves more than 350 destinations and is part of the Star Alliance. The global partnership includes other carriers like Lufthansa and Air Canada. In 2025, United added routes from Newark, New Jersey, and Tokyo, Japan, to new destinations like Nuuk, Greenland; Palermo, Italy and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, bringing its total international destinations served to 147, according to Britannica.

Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed in the app.In 2022, Instacart spent $59 million to acquire Eversight, a company specializing in artificial intelligence-driven pricing and promotions for retailers and consumer packaged goods. Instacart sought to \"create compelling savings opportunities for customers in real-time\" with Eversight, according to a regulatory filing.Earlier on Wednesday, Robert Garcia, a U.S. House Democrat from California, sent a letter to Instacart CEO Chris Rogers asking for a report on how the company sets prices.\"It is unconscionable that corporations are adding to Americans' financial strain with algorithmic — and potentially surveillance — pricing,\" wrote Garcia, who is ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.Instacart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this reportRead Reuters' full report here.",

U.S. Attorney General | Via ReutersAt least 34 U.S.-sanctioned oil tankers with a history of carrying Venezuelan oil are currently at sea in the Caribbean, according to a new analysis obtained by CNBC on Wednesday.And at least 12 of those tankers appear to be filled with crude oil from Venezuela, according to vessel location data from Kpler, a global trade intelligence company. One of the tankers, Skipper, was seized by the U.S. forces in the Caribbean last week and was being taken to the United States.Kpler provided the analysis a day after President Donald Trump vowed to impose a \"complete and total blockade\" on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuela. Trump also deemed the nation's ruling Maduro regime a foreign terrorist organization.The U.S. is expected to block only sanctioned tankers carrying oil from Venezuela, not similar vessels that have other nations' crude, including oil from Iran and Russia, according to Kpler.\"In light of President Trump's recent announcement, these tankers may be exposed to heightened scrutiny and potential enforcement actions by U.S. authorities,\" Dimitris Ampatzidis, senior risk and compliance Analyst at Kpler, told CNBC.In a separate report to clients on Wednesday, Kpler said that a blockade of Venezuelan oil should not lead to higher crude prices.Location of U.S. sanctioned Venezuelan Tankers. Green colored are tankers filled with Venezuelan oil, Orange colored are the empty tankers.Kpler\"The move has so far failed to provide a meaningful boost to oil prices or to overturn underlying fundamentals, largely because the market is two-tiered and even the sanctioned segment remains crowded,\" Kpler's report said.Oil prices rallied by nearly 2% on Wednesday.Chevron is the only company authorized by the United States to carry Venezuelan crude to the U.S.\"Oil bound for the US under Chevron's license could continue to flow,\" Kpler's report said.\"This suggests that Venezuelan supply to sanctioned markets would be disrupted, while volumes destined for the US would remain intact, with China- and Cuba-bound cargoes bearing the brunt of the impact.\"Besides Skipper, the 11 sanctioned tankers that appear to be carrying Venezuelan crude are Star Twinkle 6, Hyperion, Boceanica, Lydya N, Bandra, Soldier, Avril, Phenix VI, Manuela Saenz, Dianchi and Baisha.\"In recent years, some of these vessels engaged in so-called AIS spoofing to obscure their locations,\" said Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst for Kpler. \"With their AIS switched off, the real location of certain vessels was hidden, and while dark, there were multiple ship-to-ship transfers of cargo.\"Track of the 12 U.S.-sanctioned Venezuelan tankers in 2025MarineTrafficVenezuela has produced around 900,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate so far in 2025, accounting for roughly 1% of the total global supply. Kpler data indicates China buys about 76% of Venezuela's output.The U.S. has imported around 17% of Venezuela's output in 2025. That is about half of the percentage of output imported in 2024. Cuba, Spain and Italy are the other significant customers of Venezuela's oil.\"Cargoes bound for the US are expected to remain intact, while China and Cuba are likely to seek substitutes from Russia and Iran,\" Kpler's report noted.",

    "body": "Mexican and American flags attached to vehicles at a Tricolor dealership in Houston, Texas, Sept. 11, 2025.Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe CEO of subprime auto firm Tricolor directed a deputy to send him $6.25 million in bonuses in August as fraudulent schemes propping up the company unraveled, U.S. prosecutors alleged.Daniel Chu, the CEO and founder of Tricolor, told Chief Financial Officer Jerome Kollar to send the final two payments of his $15 million annual bonus on Aug. 19 and 20, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Wednesday.Chu, who is accused of engaging in \"systemic fraud\" over roughly seven years through 2025, used some of the money to buy a \"multimillion-dollar property\" in Beverly Hills, California, later that month, according to the filing.Within days of Chu's bonus payments, Tricolor put more than 1,000 employees on unpaid leaves of absence. By Sept. 10, the company filed for bankruptcy protection.Lawyers representing Chu didn't immediately respond to emails requesting comment on the allegations.Prosecutors say Tricolor created about $800 million in \"bogus collateral\" — at Chu's direction — by double-pledging the same assets for multiple loans and by having employees manually alter records to make delinquent loans appear eligible as collateral, according to the indictment. The abrupt collapse of Tricolor was one of a string of defaults that churned the U.S. banking industry this fall, sparking concerns over underappreciated risks in the American financial system.Around the time of the bonus payments, Chu allegedly knew his company was, in his own words, \"basically history,\" according to the filing.Prosecutors cited \"secretly recorded\" calls in August that included Chu, his CFO and chief operating officer where the founder cast about for ways to keep the company's lenders at bay.While the indictment didn't name the banks that Tricolor allegedly defrauded, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Fifth Third Bank have disclosed charges tied to the borrower.After Tricolor's lenders confronted Chu over questions about collateral pledged for loans, the CEO proposed a lie that some of the manipulated data was tied to a Trump administration loan deferment program, according to the indictment. He then considered another tactic: blaming the banks for ignoring red flags as a way to extract a settlement and keep his company alive, prosecutors said.In doing so, Chu allegedly compared Tricolor with Enron, the energy company that collapsed in 2001 after the discovery of accounting fraud.\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said, according to the documents. \"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that.\"",

Maxwell filed her petition \"pro se,\" or on her own, without a lawyer representing her in that effort.The petition comes two days before a congressionally mandated deadline for the Department of Justice to release its investigative files about Epstein and Maxwell.Maxwell says in her court filing that the new evidence she bases her application on \"emerged from related civil actions, Government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceedings.\"The filing says her conviction must be vacated because a juror at her trial in 2021 \"gave false answers during voir dire\" — the jury selection process — \"concealing a history of sexual abuse directly relevant to \"issues at trial.\"\"Subsequent interviews, new evidence and sworn statements confirm intentional concealment and actual bias\" by that juror, the filing says.In her second stated point, Maxwell said prosecutors concealed a police detective's  grand-jury testimony, \"which conflicted with his trial testimony ... and undermined the Government's only evidence, a massage table,\" which had established an element required for jurors to convict her of two of the counts in the case.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicron Technology reported fiscal first-quarter results on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings per share, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter.Micron shares rose over 7% in extended trading.Here's how the memory maker did versus LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: $4.78, adjusted, versus $3.95 estimatedRevenue: $13.64 billion vs. $12.84 billion estimatedIn the second quarter, Micron said it expected about $18.70 billion of revenue in the current quarter, versus $14.20 billion expected by LSEG. It said adjusted earnings per share would be about $8.42, blowing away expectations of $4.78 per share.\"This growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage. Server unit demand has strengthened significantly,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on an earnings call with analysts, adding that the company sees that server units grew in the \"high teens\" in 2025.Micron had $5.24 billion of net income during the first quarter, or $4.60 per share, versus $1.87 billion in the year-ago period, or $1.67 per share. Overall revenue surged 57% on a year-over-year basis. Micron makes memory and solid-state storage for computers. Those semiconductors have been in short supply in recent months as the artificial intelligence infrastructure boom requires massive amounts of both kinds of chips. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron year-to-date stock chart.The high demand for memory has driven Micron shares higher, up 168% in 2025.Micron is one of three companies that make the high-bandwidth memory needed for AI applications. For example, Micron's memory is used in large quantities in AMD's latest AI chips. Micron said it did $5.28 billion in cloud memory sales, which doubled on an annual basis. The chipmaker reported $2.38 billion in core data center sales, up only 4% year-over-year. The company said both business units were driven by higher pricing. Earlier this month, Micron said it would stop selling memory and other parts directly to consumers, to preserve supply for AI chips and data centers.

    "body": "Many Americans are looking back on 2025 with regrets about money. Nearly 40% of adults say their biggest financial regret from this year is not saving enough money, according to a new survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults by Intuit Credit Karma. These are the three most common financial regrets from 2025:Not saving enough: 38%Emotional or impulse spending: 28% Too much credit card debt: 21%It's been a year of major economic events, including President Donald Trump's tariff agenda, Federal Reserve rate cuts, a record-long government shutdown and rising unemployment. And 2 in 3 survey respondents say macroeconomic conditions like inflation and tariffs impacted their spending habits.\"People are feeling [the stress] very deeply in 2025 and there are not signs of that letting up as we look forward into the new year,\" Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Intuit Credit Karma, tells CNBC Make It.Around 73% of Americans say they are saving less for emergencies due to factors like rising prices and elevated interest rates, a recent Bankrate survey found. Additionally, around 24% of households report living paycheck to paycheck in 2025, up slightly from 2024, according to Bank of America Institute research. \"People are feeling trapped,\" says Joey Khoury, senior wealth advisor and partner at Mission Wealth. At the same time, the No. 1 habit Americans say they want to break in the new year is impulse buying, Credit Karma found, with 38% of respondents saying they want to curb the practice.Here's how experts say Americans can recover from their financial regrets and build better habits in 2026.Don't 'bury your head in the sand'One of the first steps to saving more is knowing your numbers — exactly how much money you bring in each month and how much you need to spend on essentials, Alev says. As a place to start, she suggests listing out your specific monthly bills and expenses, as well as your optional costs.\"Just seeing everything in one place brings clarity and calm, even if your situation isn't where you want it to be, at least then, you know,\" she says.Khoury agrees. \"I can always tell who's on top of their finances by asking them, what's their monthly spend rate and what's their savings rate,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter what the savings rate is. If it's low, if it's high, it doesn't matter. But the folks that know that are the folks that are paying attention.\"And paying attention is key, he adds. \"A lot of people would rather bury their head in the sand,\" because dealing with your finances can be stressful and accomplishing your goals will likely take time. Plus, the broader economic conditions out of your control may make saving more or paying off your debt increasingly difficult. \"But not paying attention to it only exacerbates the problem,\" Khoury says.'Automation is key'Another reason individuals may wind up ignoring their finances is if they figured out their spend rate once, but never updated it to factor in ongoing changes, like inflation, Khoury says.He recommends using a budgeting app or similar tool to automatically track your spending and make it easier to see where your money is going and how much you're spending in various categories. Over time, you'll be able to see if price increases or impulse buys are impacting your overall spending.\"Automation is key,\" Khoury says. \"You must automate as much of your budgeting as possible, because you're never going to sit down and comb through it on a regular frequency.\"From there, you'll be much better positioned to find areas where you can cut back, he says.Turn 'goals into systems'Alev recommends setting specific saving or spending goals and starting with \"one key priority.\" That could be maintaining your current credit card balance for a time period if paying it off entirely is too big of a goal or setting up automatic transfers to your savings account, even if it's a small amount, she says. \"It is so easy to just get paralyzed with overwhelm when you start thinking about all of the different ways that you could go to improve your financial situation, and that can really lead to you not making progress,\" she says. \"Turn those goals into systems and specific habits because that's what's gonna actually make that change stick.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate last week, and just as happened the last two times, mortgage rates rose. That caused demand for home loans and refinances to drop.Total mortgage application volume fell 3.8% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, 806,500 or less, increased to 6.38% from 6.33%, with points increasing to 0.62 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.\"Mortgage rates inched up last week following the FOMC meeting, as investors interpreted the comments to signal that we are near the end of this rate cutting cycle. As a result, mortgage applications declined slightly,\" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's SVP and chief economist in a release.Applications to refinance a home loan fell 4% for the week and were 86% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, the rate on the 30-year fixed was 37 basis points higher. While that is not a huge difference, borrowers who may have taken out a loan two years ago, when rates were well over 7%, could now benefit from a refinance.

This followed new government data on the employment picture. Markets are still waiting for government data on inflation expected Thursday. \"This is the heaviest hitting monthly inflation report and inflation is the other half of the Fed's rate-setting equation,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.

    "body": "Polymarket banner outside the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7th, 2025.Kevin Stankiewicz | CNBCPrediction markets could reach a trillion dollars in annual trading volume by the end of this decade, according to a new report from Eilers & Krejcik, a research firm that specializes in sports and interactive gaming sectors.\"Numerous factors, most notably legal and regulatory challenges, could delay or derail the growth of prediction markets,\" Eilers & Krejcik partner emeritus and strategic advisor Chris Grove told CNBC. \"But the fundamental elements of consumer demand and an array of diverse brands looking to meet that demand are clearly in place.\"That growth will be fueled by sports, which E&K predicts will represent 44% of the long-run volume for prediction markets. The booming predictions space enables users to wager on events in culture, politics and sports, among other markets. A rise in popularity for platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi has inspired traditional sportsbooks to launch their own predictions platforms. Comparing prediction trading volume to sportsbooks handle, or amount wagered, is complicated, because in prediction markets both sides of the trade are counted as volume.  For instance, if someone buys a 40-cent contract and someone else takes the 60-cent position, that's a dollar in trading volume. In sports betting, a dollar bet is strictly a dollar in handle.E&K crafted a formula to translate predictions volume into handle and concluded that mature sports prediction markets could support sportsbook-style handle that's roughly 60% to 80% of today's licensed regulated online sports betting market.Of course, online sports betting is legal only in 31 states; prediction markets have launched in all 50.   Robinhood this week introduced additional prediction markets features that allow users to trade NFL parlay and prop bets.\"The sportsbooks definitely see the writing on the wall and how this could completely disrupt their business,\" CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC Wednesday. watch nowFanatics, in partnership with Crypto.com, launched Fanatics Markets at the beginning of December to offer predictions trades. DraftKings and FanDuel are expected to launch their own prediction platforms by the end of the month.Right now, platforms like Kalshi, Robinhood, Crypto.com, Polymarket and Fanatics are pulling in roughly $10 billion, according to an analysis this week from Citizens. But analysts note, \"Prediction markets are in the early innings of exponential scaling as the asset class transitions from speculation to a more mature component of capital markets, with institutions likely coming next.\"Tenev said it more plainly: \"We think we're in the early stages of a prediction market supercycle.\"As the markets mature, the cross-selling to prediction customers is likely to diverge. After all, the way FanDuel coaxes a prediction customer onto its online sportsbook or icasino will look very different from Robinhood working to persuade a predictions trader to try trading equities.  Still, a broader trend is emerging: the convergence of investing and gambling. \"There's always been some overlap between the two, but we appear to be living in a world where gambling is [becoming] more like investing just as investing is pushing further and further in the direction of gambling,\" Grove said. Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a business relationship. ",

    "body": "watch nowShares of U.S. medical supplies giant Medline jumped in its debut on the Nasdaq on Wednesday after the biggest initial public offering of the year globally. The stock opened at $35, up from its $29 IPO price. Shares closed up more than 41% at $41 a share, bringing Medline's market capitalization to roughly $54 billion. The private equity-owned company sold a little over 216 million shares on Tuesday, raising $6.26 billion in an upsized offering that finished off a strong year for new listings and bolstered optimism about the IPO market in 2026. Shares of Medline will trade under the symbol MDLN. That IPO pricing gives Medline a market value of at least $37 billion, based on the shares listed in its regulatory filings.\"Historically, we've done very little advertising, very little marketing, and this gives us a way to amplify our voice and actually expand really the receptivity of who we are,\" Medline CEO Jim Boyle told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" earlier Wednesday. \"We are the largest company you've never heard of, and we happen to be everywhere. And that's a really interesting thing.\" The U.S. IPO market has held steady despite market volatility in the spring, driven by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, and the longest U.S. government shutdown in history in the fall. Just over 200 IPOs have priced this year, including Medline, which is the largest U.S. listing since Rivian's $13.7 billion deal in November 2021, according to data compiled by CNBC.But Medline's IPO is also among the biggest private equity-backed listings. Three private equity firms — Blackstone, Carlyle and Hellman & Friedman — acquired a majority stake in the company in 2021 for a whopping $34 billion. At the time, the deal was the biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis. CEO Jim Boyle celebrates with others as medical supplies giant Medline (MDLN) holds it's IPO at the Nasdaq stock market site in Times Square in New York, Dec. 17, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersMedline, founded in 1966, is based in Northfield, Illinois. The company manufactures and distributes roughly 335,000 different medical and surgical supplies — from gloves, masks and scalpels to wheelchairs. Medline has customers in more than 100 countries and, as of the end of 2024, employed more than 43,000 workers worldwide. Medline's total debt was around $16.8 billion as of late September 2025. The company raked in $25.5 billion in net sales in 2024. Medline's earlier plans to go public this year were postponed due to uncertainty around tariffs affecting products from Asia. The majority of the company's products are sourced or manufactured in Asian nations, particularly China. Medline expects a $150 million to $200 million hit from tariffs to income before taxes in fiscal 2026.The company competes with names like McKesson and Cardinal Health. — CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report",

    "body": "FBI Director Kash Patel, left, and Dan Bongino, deputy director of the FBI, conduct a news conference at the Department of Justice, Dec. 4, 2025.Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino on Wednesday said he will leave that post in January.Bongino, a former police officer, Secret Service agent, and conservative radio and podcast host who trafficked in conspiracy theories, was a controversial pick by President Donald Trump for the No. 2 slot at the FBI.Bongino, who will leave after less than a year on the job, is one of the first major figures of Trump's second term to step down.\"I want to thank President Trump, AG Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose,\" Bongino wrote in a social media post.\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her,\" Bongino said.Earlier Wednesday, Trump confirmed Bongino could be leaving.\"Dan did a great job,\" Trump told reporters. \"I think he wants to go back to his show.\"MS Now reported earlier in the day about Bongino's plans to leave. The outlet said he had told confidants that he would not be returning to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., to work this month.\"Print whatever you'd like,\" Bongino told MS Now when contacted for comment. \"No one believes you anyway. Thanks.\"The FBI declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.Patel, in a post on X, said \"Dan is the best partner I could've asked for in helping restore this FBI.\"\"He not only completed his mission —  he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote. \"We will miss him but I'm thankful he accepted the call to serve. Our country is better and safer for it.\"Bongino had no prior FBI when Trump tapped him for the high-profile law enforcement post.His  prior discussion of conspiracy theories on right-wing media resurfaced after he joined the government.While a private citizen, Bongino reportedly suggested that the planting of pipe bombs in Washington on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot was an \"inside job.\" U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters, after disembarking Air Force One on his return from Dover, Delaware, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S., Dec. 17, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersBut earlier this month, Bongino took a victory lap when federal agents, after a nearly five-year search, arrested and charged Brian Cole Jr. with setting those devices. Cole is not associated with the FBI or other federal authorities.When asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity how his recent comments squared with his past claims about the pipe bombs, Bongino said he was \"paid in the past\" for his opinions, \"and one day I will be back in that space.\"\"That's not what I'm paid for now. I'm paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationBongino also previously questioned official accounts of the circumstances around Jeffrey Epstein's death. The wealthy financier and notorious sex offender hanged himself while in jail in August 2019, after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.As an FBI official, Bongino said there was no question that Epstein died by suicide. \"I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There's no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise,\" he wrote on X in May.In July, the FBI released a memo concluding that Epstein died by suicide and that his rumored \"client list\" did not exist.That memo sparked a backlash among members of Trump's MAGA movement, where conspiracy theories about Epstein have proliferated for years. Soon after, Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi angrily confronted each other at the White House, according to a New York Times report.Friday is the deadline for the Trump administration to comply with a bipartisan law ordering the release of the government's files on its Epstein investigations.",

    "body": "Glen Hauenstein, president of Delta Air Lines Inc., left, and Ed Bastian, chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines Inc., right, ring the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDelta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein, who propelled the carrier to become the industry's profit leader and championed the airline's lucrative embrace of travelers willing to spend a little extra for a more luxurious travel experience, is retiring in February.\"Glen and his team have been central to Delta's premium strategy, as we evolved over two decades to become the airline of choice for travelers who want to invest in great experiences in the air and on the ground,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a note to employees. \"I could not have asked for a better co-pilot to help lead Delta in becoming the best performing airline in the world.\"Delta is promoting Joe Esposito, who has been at Delta for 35 years — most recently as senior vice president of network planning, pricing and revenue management — to executive vice president and chief commercial officer.Hauenstein, 64, has been with Delta since 2005 and was named to his current role in 2016. He was previously executive vice president and chief revenue officer at the airline. He will become a strategic advisor until the end of 2026. Read more CNBC airline newsFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026During his tenure, Hauenstein grew Delta's international network and helped the airline identify new ways to earn more per seat, in part by successfully getting customers to pay for first-class seats it used to give away for free. In October, Delta said that premium-travel revenue would overtake sales from main cabin next year.At times, Delta's strategies proved successful with too many customers. Overcrowding in its Sky Club airport lounges prompted the airline to raise the entry bar to get rid of unsightly lines.\"Glen has played a significant role in Delta's transformation since its [2005] bankruptcy filing,\" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel-industry consulting firm. Hauenstein pushed for the now-industry standard to move the loyalty program to reward spending and not just miles flown and encouraged Delta to invest in better pricing and revenue software, he said.Harteveldt added that Delta must also figure out when it will upgrade its cabin interiors and make sure it's not alienating customers, some of whom have complained about high redemption rates for frequent flyer miles.While Delta continues to generate more profit than other carriers, competitors like United Airlines have been investing heavily in revamped cabins, complimentary fast Wi-Fi and new planes. American Airlines, which had been late to the luxury travel boom, is also investing in better products on board and at the airport.Along with leaning into affluent consumers, Hauenstein had also noted a trend of wealthy baby boomers who were willing to travel.\"Being a baby boomer, I can say this without fear of retribution. There's only so much time to go to Europe or almost so much time to go see Australia or Japan,\" he said on an earnings call in April. \"And so you've got this wealth effect where this cohort of retirees is wealthier than any other cohort even with the most recent rundown, and they want to go do things.\"",

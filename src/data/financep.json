Kent Nishimura | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said his administration has \"identified funds\" to pay troops next week despite the federal government shutdown.Trump said in a post on Truth Social: \"I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether all or some members of the U.S. military would be paid and which funds the government will use to pay them.Paychecks would be due for 1.3 million active members of the U.S. military on Oct. 15, raising the potential political costs of the impasse, some economists have said.\"We believe the military pay date on Oct. 15 could be an important forcing event for a compromise to restore funding and expect the shutdown to end by mid-October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Ronnie Walker and Alec Phillips said in a client note.The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal workers across a range of agencies on Friday, the 10th day of the government shutdown.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that the number of federal workers who will be laid off will \"be a lot.\"\"It'll be Democrat-oriented,\" Trump said, reiterating his promise to target programs he believes are favored by Democratic officials. The uncertainty over which federal workers will be paid — and which will be laid off or potentially fired — has heightened anxiety among workers.Members of the aviation industry have raised concerns about added strains on already thinly staffed air traffic controllers across the country. Next week, they will receive their first partial paycheck and are set to miss a full paycheck on Oct. 28 if the funding impasse isn't resolved, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, stated on Friday.The union said it plans to start informational leafleting on Tuesday at New York's LaGuardia Airport about the effects of the shutdown on controllers. Similar events are scheduled at other airports in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia.\"Participating air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals plan to engage with travelers to explain how the government shutdown introduces unnecessary risk to the National Airspace System (NAS) and is detrimental to efficiency,\" the union said.— CNBC's Jeff Cox and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

Nathan Howard | ReutersThe Trump administration and AstraZeneca announced Friday they have reached an agreement for the U.K.-based pharmaceutical giant to cut drug prices in the U.S.The deal with AstraZeneca follows a similar pact with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which was announced late last month.AstraZeneca will agree to sell drugs directly to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed countries, or what Trump calls \"most-favored nation\" pricing, on a coming government website called TrumpRx.gov. AstraZeneca's primary care medications will be available on the site starting early next year, and the company will offer new prescription medications at most-favored nation pricing, said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot also said the company will be exempt from pharmaceutical sector tariffs as part of the agreement. Pfizer agreed to similar terms with the Trump administration and received a three-year carveout from pharmaceutical tariffs on the condition that it continued to invest in U.S. manufacturing.AstraZeneca in July said it would invest $50 billion in the U.S. by 2030. The company announced further details about those plans Friday ahead of the reported pricing deal announcement.President Donald Trump, administration officials and Soriot announced the agreement during a White House event on Friday. MSNBC earlier reported on the deal.Trump has pushed drugmakers to cut prices and build out manufacturing in the U.S., as sky-high costs for medicines relative to other developed countries irk voters across the political spectrum. As his administration threatened pharmaceutical companies with tariffs as high as 250% in recent months, many drugmakers announced significant investments in the U.S.Trump has said he aims to strike pricing deals with other major drugmakers in the weeks ahead. Trump suggested drugmakers and other companies have invested as much as they did because of the threat of higher tariff costs. \"Most of them are here because of tariffs,\" he said. ",

Ken Cedeno | ReutersDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at a U.S. Air Force Base in Idaho.Hegeth said the facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base will allow pilots from Qatar's air force to train with American military personnel.The Defense secretary made the announcement at a Pentagon press conference with Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.Hegseth said the facility will \"host a contingent a Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"Qatar is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. The Al-Udeid Air Base, whose 10,000 or so service members make it the largest American military installation in the Middle East, is located in Qatar, near the capital of Doha.Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist who has influence with President Donald Trump, blasted the announcement.\"Never thought I'd see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,\" Loomer wrote on X.\"I don't think I'll be voting in 2026. I cannot in good conscience make any excuses for the harboring of jihadis. This is where I draw the line,\" Loomer wrote.Trump himself in 2017 said, \"The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\" That comment came during a dispute between Qatar and other Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, who had blockaded Qatar over claims that it had backed extremist Muslim groups.Qatar has denied financing terrorists.After a backlash among some Trump supporters, such as Loomer, to Friday's announcement, Hegseth posted what he called an \"important clarification\" on X, saying, \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft.\"\"However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base,\" Hegseth wrote. \"We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots.The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement.The announcement is another sign of the deepening of the relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesIn September, after Israel executed an airstrike on senior leaders of the Hamas terror group in Doha, Trump signed an executive order \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar.\"Earlier this year, the U.S accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family. Trump has said he wants that jet, valued at $400 million, converted for use as Air Force One, the presidential aircraft.NBC News has reported that the jet is expected to be handed over to Trump's future presidential library after he leaves the White House in January 2029.A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet looked like a bribe to Trump.Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm, as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during an announcement about lowering U.S. drug prices, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 10, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersOn Friday morning, the S&P 500 was less than a couple of points from another all-time high. Then, after a single social media post from President Donald Trump, $2 trillion in market value was wiped out.The unraveling shows the sway the president's one-man trade policy still has over the fate of the global economy.Trump at 10:57 a.m. ET wrote on his Truth Social platform that China was \"becoming very hostile\" with the rest of the world, especially when it comes to its control of rare earth metals. He accused China of holding the world \"captive\" because of its \"monopoly\" on these crucial resources. The key part that the stock market reacted to in the 500-word Trump post was this: \"One of the policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America.\"That's all it took.Bespoke Investment Group calculates that about $2 trillion in value from the U.S. stock market was erased by that single post. The S&P 500 lost 2.7% as the closing bell rang out at the New York Stock Exchange. It was its worst performance since early April, when the stock market was in the throes of a cascading sell-off from Trump's so-called liberation day rollout of higher-than-expected duties for every country on the globe.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 1-dayThe Nasdaq Composite, home to the technology companies that rely on trade with China, sank 3.56%, also its worst performance since April. The Nasdaq touched an all-time high before the Trump post in Friday's session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 879 points, or 1.9% for its worst performance since May. The Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark shed 3%.Why such a violent drop?While the Trump administration's trade talks with China have been progressing at a much slower pace than those with other countries, the stock market consensus was that something would eventually be worked out between the two nations and that overall relations were improving. Trump and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping were set to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit at the end of this month.The market had also become comfortable with the around 40% tariff rate already applied to China, reasoning that the U.S. economy was stronger than previously thought to withstand it, and exemptions for products made in China — like Apple's iPhones — were broad enough to soften any economic impact.A trader works at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 10, 2025. NYSEIf Trump follows through with his latest threat, investors fear that the load may be too great to bear for the U.S. economy, which is still reliant on imported parts to build automobiles, solar panels, and the like.Perhaps the greater risk that weighs on the market is retaliation from China on U.S. goods that could lead to an all-out trade war.What sparked Trump's threat?China, overnight into Thursday, tightened its grip further on the rare earths market, of which it controls about 70% of the global supply. Beijing said outside entities must obtain licenses to export pretty much anything using its rare earths and that companies using the metals for military applications would be denied. The companies' usage would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by China.A trader works at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 10, 2025. NYSERare earths are crucial for making semiconductors, electric vehicles and materials for advanced missiles. Trump has been trying to bolster the U.S. supplies of the metal by supporting, and even investing in, U.S. and Canada-based companies that mine for the metal.What led Friday's sell-off?Chipmakers such as Nvidia and AMD led the stock market drop Friday. Nvidia, which is still trying to gain support from the two countries to sell a less-advanced AI chip to China, lost 5%. AMD, which had been leading the latest leg of the rally, sank nearly 8%. Apple lost 3%, while Tesla shed 5%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-dayBut it wasn't just shares of companies directly related to China trade that declined. It was a broad market sell-off, with 424 of the S&P 500 members closing in the red. Pro investors were forced to reduce risk in everything due to a sudden drop of this magnitude. With their tech positions getting hit, other holdings needed to be sold to raise cash. Plus, there's the threat the potential new tariffs pose to the U.S. economy. Domestic financials Bank of America and Wells Fargo lost more than 2% each, for example.A few stocks did manage to stay green on the day. Walmart and the tobacco/nicotine stocks were slightly higher because of their defensive properties.How long will this sell-off last?Monday could be another rough day for the markets because Trump followed up his morning post after the closing bell by saying he would impose 100% tariffs on China \"over and above any tariff that they are currently paying.\" Trump added that the U.S. would put export controls on \"any and all critical software,\" which could significantly impact AI leaders like Nvidia. The new duties would begin at the start of next month, around the time of the summit when Trump was set to meet with Xi. Trump's Friday morning post suggested those talks may not happen now.The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, a fund that tracks the S&P 500, added a bit to Friday's session losses after the bell.Still, some traders and investors believe it may be wise to wait and see if Trump follows through fully on this threat. Most of the stiff tariffs threatened in early April — which sent global markets reeling — were subsequently pared back significantly through negotiations and exemptions, laying the groundwork for a monster comeback rally to new highs for the market. It paid then to call Trump on his bluff and buy the dip — and many investors think it will again.\"The good news is that this may just be another negotiating tactic used by the administration that could yield good results over the long term,\" said Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, during the height of the selling pressure at the NYSE. \"The knee-jerk sell-off should be another buying opportunity.\"It's worth having some perspective on Friday's sell-off as well. The drop only took the S&P 500 back to its lowest level in a month. The benchmark is still up more than 11% for the year, with a seemingly unstoppable AI trade overshadowing any threat from tariffs, global conflicts and an ongoing government shutdown.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, YTDThe move disrupted an unusually placid period for the stock market, jarring complacent investors into running for cover for the first time in a long while and adding to the pain. Thursday was the 33rd straight day without a 1% S&P 500 move in either direction, the longest calm streak since January 2020. The market hasn't had a major decline since the April tariff rollout correction.One risk is that this sell-off breaks other things on Wall Street. There's a small, but still growing contagion related to the bankruptcy of private auto parts supplier First Brands. It's roiling banks with exposure like Jefferies Financial Group and raising concerns about the once-booming private credit industry. Jefferies was down 4% on Friday and another 6% in after-hours trading.That's an area to watch, along with the possibility that large hedge funds buying on margin were caught too-long on Friday and now have to aggressively deleverage, which could add to selling pressures next week. The crypto markets, especially the smaller coins outside of bitcoin, were hit especially hard on Friday. The TRUMP meme coin is down 20% in the last 24 hours.Stock market futures open for trading Sunday evening at 6 p.m. ET. The bond market is closed Monday for Columbus Day.",

The report will come out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Oct. 24, nine days after it was originally scheduled, according to the BLS.The department had originally paused work on the CPI report – which tracks a broad basket of goods and services for price changes over time — because of its shutdown plan, the official said. But the Social Security Administration needs third-quarter CPI data for calculating and publishing annual cost-of-living adjustments before Nov. 1.Other BLS data releases including the nonfarm payroll report haven't been published as originally intended since the federal government shutdown due to a lapse in funding. The Senate on Thursday failed to pass funding bills for the seventh time that would have ended the closure, which began last week.Bloomberg News first reported that the BLS was calling employees back to work on the CPI data.— CNBC's Steve Liesman contributed to this report.Correction: The Social Security Administration needs third-quarter CPI data for calculating and publishing annual cost-of-living adjustments before Nov. 1.

With how \"big this market is, we can keep growing for a long, long time, and that's really exciting.\"CAGR stands for compound annual growth rate, a measurement of the rate of return.The Arlington, Virginia-based company also announced a $150 million growth investment from Bain Capital. It plans to use the money to expand its team and product offering to satisfy growing security demands.In recent years, venture capitalists have poured more money into defense tech startups like Govini to satisfy heightened national security concerns and modernize the military as global conflict ensues.The group, which includes unicorns like Palmer Luckey's Anduril, Shield AI and artificial intelligence beneficiary Palantir, is taking on legacy giants such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, that have long leaned on contracts from the Pentagon.Read more CNBC tech newsSingapore police probe Nvidia customer Megaspeed over alleged China export violationsTesla faces U.S. auto safety probe after reports FSD ran red lights, caused collisionsTop Hollywood agencies slam OpenAI's Sora as 'exploitation' and a risk to clientsGoogle launches Gemini subscriptions to help corporate workers build AI agentsDougherty, who previously worked at Palantir, said she hopes the company can seize a \"vertical slice\" of the defense technology space.The 14-year-old Govini has already secured a string of big wins in recent years, including an over $900-million U.S. government contract and deals with the Department of War.Govini is known for its flagship AI software Ark, which it says can help modernize the military's defense tech supply chain by better managing product lifecycles as military needs grow more sophisticated.\"If the United States can get this acquisition system right, it can actually be a decisive advantage for us,\" Dougherty said.Looking ahead, Dougherty told CNBC that she anticipates some setbacks from the government shutdown.Navy customers could be particularly hard hit, and that could put the U.S. at a major disadvantage.While the U.S. is maintaining its AI dominance, China is outpacing its shipbuilding capacity and that needs to be taken \"very seriously,\" she added.Dougherty also noted China's dominance in rare earths and processed minerals that are critical to making parts and systems for the military. \"The rare earth crisis that we're in is a serious one,\" she said, \"because one of the things that you can see in the data that we have in our proprietary data set tracks national security programs down to the raw materials.\"",

The outlet cited five unnamed administration officials.The woman later \"discovered that Ingrassia had arranged ahead of time to have her hotel room canceled so she would have to stay with him,\" three officials said, according to Politico.She \"initially protested\" the arrangement, but relented in order to avoid causing a scene around other colleagues, Politico reported officials saying. The two slept in separate beds in the room, according to Politico.In a letter to Politico, a lawyer for the 30-year-old Ingrassia denied the harassment allegations.The news outlet did not name the woman, but said that she was a Trump appointee, \"Mr. Ingrassia has never harassed any coworkers — female or otherwise, sexually or otherwise — in connection with any employment,\" the attorney, Edward Paltzik, wrote.Paltzik said that while the two did share a hotel room on the trip, Ingrassia did not cancel the woman's reservation and \"no party engaged in inappropriate behavior.\"In a separate letter to CNBC, Paltzik said Ingrassia \"did not engage in any wrongdoing in connection with the matters reported.\"The woman filed a human resources complaint against him but retracted it days later out of fear of retaliation, three officials told Politico. An HR investigation into Ingrassia cleared him, Paltzik and a DHS spokesperson told Politico.The woman told Politico in a statement that she \"never felt uncomfortable\" about Ingrassia's behavior and that she never made a complaint.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Politico's report.Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that oversees whistleblower complaints and investigates federal employees.The nomination came after Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Dellinger had reportedly opposed the layoffs of federal employees ordered by Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Dellinger challenged his dismissal in a lawsuit but later dropped the suit.In his role as White House liaison, Ingrassia has pushed for the hiring of candidates at the Department of Justice who show \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump, ABC News earlier reported.Ingrassia's chances of being confirmed to lead OSC appeared to falter in July, when Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would not back Trump's pick.Read Politico's full report here.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds a next generation iPhone 17 during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on Sept. 9, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is in late-stage talks to acquire top talent from computer vision startup Prompt AI, as well as the company's technology, CNBC has learned.Leadership at Prompt told employees of the pending transaction at an all-hands meeting on Thursday and said that those who don't end up joining Apple will be paid a reduced salary, and encouraged to apply for open roles at the company, according to audio that was accessed by CNBC.The 11-person company was approached by other potential suitors, including Elon Musk's xAI and Neuralink, executives said in the meeting.Prompt was founded in 2023 and raised a $5 million seed round that year led by AIX and Abstract Ventures. Co-founders include CEO Tete Xiao, a notable AI researcher with a Phd in computer science from UC Berkeley, and President Trevor Darrell who was a founder of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR) lab.Xiao and Darrell didn't respond to requests for comment, nor did Apple. Neither xAI nor Neuralink immediately responded to a request for comment.Investors will get paid some money in the deal but \"won't be made whole,\" executives said in the meeting. Prompt employees were asked to refrain from mentioning Apple until further notice while searching for other jobs or updating friends and family on their situation.Prompt's flagship app, Seemour, connects to home security cameras, adding sophisticated capabilities. The technology helps cameras detect specific people, pets and other animals or objects around a household, and to send alerts and text-based descriptions of unusual activity or answer questions about what's been happening in front of the camera.Xiao told employees at the meeting that while Prompt AI's technology and the Seemour app were working well, the business model wasn't. The company is retiring the Seemour app, and plans to inform users their data will be deleted and privacy protected, executives said.Silicon Valley's tech giants have been snapping up top AI talent through acquihires, in part to bolster their AI research and development in a way that helps them skirt regulatory concerns. Apple's deal for Prompt is much smaller than recent high-profile transactions, such as Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI that brought with it the company's founder and other execs, and Google's $2.4 billion deal for Windsurf's CEO and leaders that included licensing fees.Apple has historically avoided making large acquisitions. In the half-century since its founding, Apple's biggest purchase was the $3 billion deal for Beats Electronics in 2014. The company prefers to quietly acquire smaller teams and use their talent and technology to develop features for its product lines.Some analysts have attributed Apple's relatively slow progress in AI to its unwillingness to make big purchases. Its stock is down 2% this year, badly trailing major indexes and the worst performance among the tech megcaps.While Apple Intelligence, the iPhone maker's foray into generative AI, has underwhelmed critics and faced delays, the company achieved technical success with computer vision, especially in its mixed reality headset, Vision Pro. The iPhone also has the ability to decipher what objects, people or pets are in photographs taken by users.Prompt's technology and talent are likely to be part of Apple's HomeKit smart home division.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.WATCH: Apple must get AI story right to drive next upgrade cyclewatch now",

    "body": "Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, July 24, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal workers across a range of agencies on Friday, the 10th day of the U.S. government shutdown.President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon told reporters in the Oval Office that the number of federal workers who will be laid off will \"be a lot.\"\"It'll be Democrat-oriented,\" Trump said, reiterating his promise to target programs he believes are favored by Democratic officials.The permanent job cuts, formally known as \"Reductions in Force,\" are different from the furloughing of government workers. Furloughed employees return to their jobs after a government shutdown ends.The layoffs were first announced by Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.\"The RIFs have begun,\" Vought wrote on X.OMB soon after confirmed his tweet, and said the cuts \"are substantial.\"RIF notices went to workers at the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Energy, EPA, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior. A filing by the Justice Department in U.S. District Court in San Francisco late Friday showed at least 4,000 federal workers received layoff notices, with Treasury and HHS seeing the largest cuts, of more than 1,100 employees apiece.The filing came in response to a lawsuit filed on Sept. 30 by two unions that represent many federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of County, State & Municipal Employees.The lawsuit challenges the legality of the RIFs, which at the time the suit was filed were threatened by the Trump administration. A hearing on the unions' request for a temporary restraining order to block the layoffs is scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco.\"These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement.\"Whether it's food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration's political games,\" Saunders said.The layoffs started four days after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett warned in a CNBC interview that could \"start taking sharp measures\" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress.Hassett said that \"any government worker who loses their job\" will have Democrats to blame for their layoff.watch nowWhile many federal workers have been furloughed because of the shutdown, it is not the normal practice in shutdowns to permanently lay off government employees.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said, \"Russell Vought just fired thousands of Americans with a tweet. \"Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.\" \"Here's what's worse: Republicans would rather see thousands of Americans lose their jobs than sit down and negotiate with Democrats to reopen the government,\" Schumer said.Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a statement said, \"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.\"\"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,\" Collins said. \"Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.\"Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.Although Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they need the votes of at least some Democratic senators to pass a funding bill because of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate required to avoid filibusters blocking legislation.",

    "body": "Kate_sept2004 | E+ | Getty ImagesThere's a big change coming for 401(k) plans that could impact a popular tax break for higher earners, experts say.For 2025, workers can defer up to $23,500 into 401(k) plans, and employees age 50 or older can save an extra $7,500, known as \"catch-up contributions.\" That catch-up limit jumps to $11,250 for workers age 60 to 63.    Typically, catch-up contributions can be traditional pretax or after-tax Roth, depending on what your 401(k) plan allows. But certain higher earners soon won't have a choice, thanks to a change enacted via the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022.Starting in 2026, 401(k) catch-up contributions generally must be after-tax Roth if you earned more than $145,000 from your current employer during the previous year. In the meantime, older workers can choose between traditional and Roth 401(k) catch-up contributions, assuming their plan offers both options.While traditional deferrals offer an upfront tax break, you will pay regular income taxes on future withdrawals. By comparison, there is no tax deduction for Roth contributions, but the funds grow tax-free.\"Now is the time to work with your advisor or tax preparer to run multi-year tax projections,\" said certified financial planner Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon. This could help you decide whether to accelerate pretax catch-up contributions through 2025 or embrace Roth contributions sooner, experts say.Pick between pretax and Roth 401(k)In 2024, nearly all retirement plans offered catch-up contributions, but only 16% of eligible workers made these deferrals, according to a 2025 Vanguard report based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants.Most catch-up contribution participants earned $150,000 or more, the report found.However, the choice between Roth vs. pretax catch-up contributions may depend on several factors, including current and expected future tax brackets, experts say. You may also consider your effective tax rate — total tax relative to earnings — in retirement or legacy planning goals.The \"key takeaway\" for investors is, \"do not sit on the sidelines\" as the rules change, said CFP Jared Gagne, assistant vice president and private wealth manager with Claro Advisors in Boston.  ",

Friday evening, Trump announced on social media that he would put an extra 100% tariff on imports.Earnings season kicks off on Tuesday, starting with quarterly results from Blackrock, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Cramer said all three have had solid runs this year, and they \"aren't exactly in the crosshairs of the trade war.\" He suggested Goldman Sachs might have \"the biggest upside surprise.\" JPMorgan and Citigroup will report that day, and Cramer said he's optimistic about the results from both banks.Tuesday also brings earnings from Johnson & Johnson and Domino's Pizza. Cramer said he expects the pharmaceutical giant to report the best quarter of the sector, but indicated the pizza maker could miss the estimates.Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Abbott Laboratories are set to report on Wednesday, and Cramer noted that Morgan Stanley has been surprisingly positive for the last several quarters. He also said Abbott Laboratories is usually reliable.Wednesday also brings analyst meetings from Salesforce and Dollar Tree. Cramer noted that both companies' stocks have been under pressure as of late — with Salesforce weighed down by worries about its artificial intelligence offerings and Dollar Tree burdened by new tariffs.Trucking giant J.B. Hunt and United Airlines are set to report Wednesday, and Cramer said these two could provide a solid read on the economy as investors largely lack economic data due to the government shutdown.On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor, CSX and Charles Schwab will report earnings. Cramer said he expects largely positive figures from Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures chips for industry leaders Nvidia and AMD. Cramer said CSX will likely explain its recent leadership shakeup, while Schwab can give insight to retail participation in the market.Friday brings quarterly reports from American Express and oil giant SLB. Shares of American Express tend to decline right after earnings, Cramer said. He added that management from SLB usually \"tells it like it is.\"watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club Charitable Trust owns shares of Salesforce, Blackrock, Wells Fargo, Abbott Laboratories, Nvidia and Goldman Sachs.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "Robert E. Yarber is on top of the world — literally. The 41-year-old American currently resides in Tromso, Norway, a town you'll find at just about the tippy top of your map. It's about 220 miles north of the Arctic Circle.And given his troubled past — and the peace he's found in his new home — it's an apt description of his emotional state as well.\"I sat in a prison cell, a six-by-nine cell, with another grown man for five years of my life,\" Yarber says. \"I wanted to see Paris, London, Berlin, and swim in the Mediterranean, check out the Dead Sea. I wanted to see all that stuff with my eyes. I didn't want to watch it on TV.\"Shortly after he got out of prison for good in 2014, Yarber embarked on a European adventure, one that's seen him travel to 44 countries and establish a new home for himself abroad. \"I just bet it all on myself and went for it all,\" he says.Robert E. Yarber, 41, works as a bartender and bar manager in Tromso, Norway.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItSo far, so good.Yarber currently works as a bartender and bar manager and makes about $26 an hour for an annual income of about $46,000. It's not a fortune, but it's more than enough to live a comfortable life among people he says have truly embraced him.\"It's so much love, and I feel so welcome. I mean, Norway is my home,\" he says. \"When I'm in the States, I feel like a fish out of water, almost. And now here in Norway, I've been able to move and groove a little bit.\"Bad decisions and imprisonmentIn his youth, Yarber did much of his moving and grooving on the football field — he set a league record for interceptions during is junior year of high school in Corvalis, Oregon.\"And I just figured I would just go to university, and I just kept going to the next level,\" he says.However, a pair of knee injuries ended Yarber's football career, and he dropped out of college after his freshman year. He took a job as a dishwasher at Denny's, his first of many in the food and beverage service industry.In 2006, when Yarber was 21, things went off the rails. While attending a party, Yarber and a friend got in a physical altercation with other guests, which Yarber says escalated into a melee. When Yarber managed to escape back to his car, he found himself faced with a difficult decision.\"I'm sitting there and I'm like, 'Man, I could get in the car and drive away. I'm free,'\" he says. \"This is my best friend at the time. It's my roommate, and he's still in there all by himself, and nobody to help him.\"Yarber was determined to see the world after spending five years in prison as a young man.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItYarber pulled two baseball bats from his trunk and went back in. He'd be the first to tell you it was the wrong choice.He spent a four-year sentence in Oregon State Penitentiary as a result of the incident. And when he got out, finding his footing was tougher than he thought.\"When I got out and I was trying to get a job, I couldn't get a job,\" Yarber says. \"I tried for all the jobs I wanted to get. Couldn't get those. Tried for all the jobs I didn't want. Couldn't get those. Tried for all the jobs I felt were like beneath me that I would never have done before. Couldn't get those either.\"To support himself, Yarber took a former cellmate up on an offer to sell cocaine. He was caught and did another 14 months in prison. He was released in March of 2014. He's stayed out of legal trouble since.Heading north and 'just trying to figure it out'Yarber struggled initially upon his release. He managed to find gigs as a server and bartender, but had difficulty keeping his life and relationships on firm footing as he wrestled with addiction.When he and a serious girlfriend lost a pregnancy, Yarber says he fell into a depression and knew he needed a change of scenery. In December of 2018 he found a job in the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska.\"I figured, if I go there, there's really not much trouble you can get into. You're on an island can't get off,\" Yarber says. \"I was going to just go there, work in a fish factory and the processing plant and just try to get some sobriety under my belt and just try to figure it out.\"He soon realized Alaska wasn't quite far enough. He had previously planned a trip to Norway with his ex, a woman of Norwegian heritage. The trip was canceled when the pair broke up. But when he decided to take a shot at living overseas, he figured he'd already done all the research and didn't mind the cold. He packed his bags for Scandanavia in May 2019.Yarber was granted a skilled worker visa in 2022 after attending European Bartender School.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItMoving abroad, though, wasn't quite as easy as Yarber would have thought.\"I honestly thought that I could just walk into another country, walk into a bar, and just be like, 'Hey, can I get a job?'\" he says. When asked if he had a visa, he told a prospective employer that, yes, he had a credit card.He applied for a visa four times, running into problems over his pay, his bona fides as a skilled laborer and proving his vaccination status during the Covid-19 pandemic. Eventually, after he attended European Bartender School and got the rest of his documents in order, Yarber was granted a skilled worker visa in 2022, which he renews annually for about $640.Life in Norway: 'The country really cares about its people'For the most part, life above the Arctic Circle is pretty quiet.Yarber tends and manages the bar at the Havblikk Hotel in Tromsdalen — the town just across the bridge from Tromso. It's an upscale joint frequented by locals.He earns around 260 kroner, or about $26 an hour, and tends to work about 35 hours a week. Income in Norway is taxed at a flat 22% rate plus a graduated \"bracket tax\" a further contribution to the country's national insurance. Yarber says he's taxed a rate of about 32% to 34%, but he still feels like he has plenty of money to live a comfortable life. He lives alone in a 35-square meter apartment, complete with what he says is a universal Norwegian luxury: heated bathroom floors.On a typical day, you might find him working out at the gym or sharing a chai latte with friends — mostly other service industry workers. Otherwise, he might catch a movie or spend time playing video games or creating content for his YouTube or TikTok channels.Plus, Yarber feels like his taxes are being put to good use. Workers enjoy substantial protections in Norway, he says. Those who work odd hours are paid at a premium, and employees' hours cannot be cut or rescheduled without their permission he says — which is unheard of in the American service industry.Yarber is studying for a Norwegian language and social studies test in the hopes of becoming a permanent resident.Ismaele Tortella for CNBC Make ItAnd if he gets sick or injured, he's covered.\"That tax money goes to work by paying for surgeries when you need it, paying for medication, paying for rides to the hospital and back,\" Yarber says. \"Sick leave, leave if you have children or parental leave — it just shows that it's a country that really cares about its people and isn't trying to use everything to make money.\"Looking aheadIn short, Yarber feels like he's found a home. He's practicing for his Norwegian language test — part of the process of becoming a permanent resident. He rates his current proficiency at about a five out of 10. He can carry a conversation and order at a restaurant, he says.\"Could I get up and do a TED talk in Norwegian? No.\"All in due time. Yarber hopes to eventually stash some of his money away in order to buy a car (he currently relies on public transportation) and a house in his new hometown. Until now, he hasn't saved much, opting instead to use any extra funds to travel.\"I should be having savings but, and maybe it's this trauma from being in prison for so long and just wanting to see the world, I've now traveled to 44 countries,\" he says. \"I spend my money on traveling. If I got extra money, I'm traveling. I just want to see the world.\"It's a sentiment that puts him right at home in the land of Norse explorers. \"I'm a Black Viking in heart,\" he says.Conversions from NOK to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 1 USD to 9.85 NOK on Sept. 19, 2025.

    "body": "The Hollywood Burbank Airport air traffic control tower stands in Burbank, California, on Oct. 6, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesTravelers should prepare for potential flight disruptions this holiday weekend as the government shutdown continues, a group representing the largest U.S. airlines said Friday.Air traffic controller shortages this week delayed flights at some U.S. airports, including in Burbank, California, and Nashville, Tennessee.\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" said Airlines for America, whose members include Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and others.Bad weather could also snarl travel over the long weekend. The National Weather Service on Friday issued a flood watch for New York, Long Island, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey from an expected storm.During a federal government shutdown, \"essential\" workers such as air traffic controllers and TSA agents worth without pay, while many other employees are placed on furlough.A more than monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Absences of air traffic controllers rose this week as the current shutdown stretched into its second week, Bryan Bedford, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, reiterated to staff on Friday.\"Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,\" he said in a note to employees, which was seen by CNBC.Tuesday will mark the first partial paycheck for air traffic controllers, and Oct. 28 would be the first suspended payday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, said on Friday.The union said it plans to start informational leafleting on Tuesday at New York's LaGuardia Airport about the effects of the shutdown on controllers. Similar events are scheduled at other airports in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia. \"Participating air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals plan to engage with travelers to explain how the government shutdown introduces unnecessary risk to the National Airspace System (NAS) and is detrimental to efficiency,\" the union said.Delta CEO Ed Bastian earlier this week told CNBC that the carrier has so far not seen \"any impacts at all\" to its operation because of the shutdown. However, he said that could change if it continued for another roughly 10 days.On Friday, close to 3,700 U.S. flights were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, below the average daily rate of about 4,100 for U.S. airlines so far this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flights",

    "body": "The launch of OpenAI's updated Sora 2 AI video service kicked off another round of anxiety among musicians, actors and other content creators.Sora allows users to generate short videos for free by typing in a prompt. The app is only available on iOS devices and is limited to invitees, meaning people need a code to access it. Still, Sora has climbed to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store, and OpenAI said this week it hit 1 million downloads in less than five days after launch.Major Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association have objected to OpenAI's copyright policies, and top Hollywood agencies are calling it \"exploitation.\" That's led to changes in how the model handles prompts for certain sensitive categories of generated content. CNBC's Julia Boorstin got access to Sora 2 and tried prompts like \"show me a video of a fat orange cartoon cat eating lasagna\" and \"create a superhero that wears a black cape and is saving a woman from a burning building.\" Some of the prompts failed due to copyright infringement, while others worked.

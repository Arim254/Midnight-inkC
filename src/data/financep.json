    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a roundtable on housing affordability in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoth congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump both want to limit how many homes major corporations can own, but a new proposal from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., makes it clear that's where the agreement ends. In a bill released hours before Trump's State of the Union speech, Warren, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and 16 other Senate Democrats propose ending some housing-related tax benefits for major corporations. The bill would prevent companies with more than 50 single-family homes for rent from taking deductions for housing value depreciation and mortgage interest payments. Corporations would also be barred from getting federally backed mortgages. The bill would provide a temporary carve-out for companies building new multifamily housing or rehabilitating properties that would otherwise be uninhabitable. The Trump administration is pushing its own housing proposal. In a memo sent to lawmakers last week, the administration proposed banning institutional investors who own more than 100 single-family homes from buying any new ones. Trump's proposal also includes several exceptions for companies that increase the number of single-family homes.The dueling proposals come as legislation to boost housing supply and affordability is in the home stretch to becoming law. The House passed a bipartisan bill earlier this month with broad support, and the Senate advanced its own bipartisan bill last year. The two sides are working to combine the proposals into a final package. ",

    "body": "The People's Bank of China (PBOC) building in Beijing, China, on Tuesday, April 18, 2023.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's central bank kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged Tuesday as authorities navigate a balancing act of supporting a slowing economy while maintaining currency stability. The People's Bank of China held its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates at 3% and 3.5%, respectively, keeping them steady for a tenth straight month despite stuttering economic growth. The 1-year rate serves as the benchmark for most new and outstanding loans, while the 5-year level influences mortgages. The world's second-largest economy showed signs of slowing down in the final quarter of last year, expanding 4.5% year on year, its slowest pace since the country lifted its stringent Covid curbs in late 2022.  Chinese authorities have struggled to lift the economy out of an entrenched deflation as consumers cut back spending amid a prolonged real estate downturn, a bleak job market and uncertain income prospects. Retail sales growth fell to a 3-year low of 0.9% in December while the GDP deflator — a metric that shows changes in prices of goods and services — has stayed negative for 11 consecutive quarters. Policymakers have turned to promoting the consumption of services to boost overall spending, betting that elderly care services, leisure and tourism can help make up for the tepid demand in goods. The Chinese yuan has continued to appreciate in recent months, with the offshore yuan strengthening from around 6.974 per U.S. dollar at the start of the year to 6.889 Tuesday morning, according to LSEG data. The PBOC in recent weeks has signaled some tolerance for a gradual strengthening in its currency, with the dollar's weakness paving the way for the yuan to extend its advance. The central bank manages the yuan by keeping it within a band that is 2% on either side of a midpoint that it fixes each trading day. The officials have moved its so-called fixing level lower, dipping below the 7-benchmark for the first time in nearly three years in late January. A strengthening yuan could test the country's export machine already under pressure due to U.S. tariffs, eroding a competitive advantage for exporters who face price pressure from other manufacturing rivals. Economists at ING forecast a fluctuation band of 6.85 to 7.25 this year as Beijing seeks to advance the internationalization of its currency. \"The wildcard will be if the currency stability objective is softened in 2026,\" the bank said.

    "body": "Former British Ambassador to the U.S. Peter Mandelson is led away from his home by a police officer as he is arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following revelations over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in London, Britain, Feb. 23, 2026, in this screen capture from video.BBC | Via ReutersPolice in London released Peter Mandelson, Britain's former ambassador to the United States, on bail Tuesday local time, hours after his arrest earlier.Mandelson has been under investigation for his relationship with notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Metropolitan Police in London said that Lord Mandelson, 72, was arrested Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the same grounds on which other police in Britain last week arrested and briefly detained Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince and longtime friend of Epstein. Police did not identify Mandelson by name, as is customary in Britain, but photos of him being led from his house by police were published Monday. In an update Tuesday, the police said \"a 72-year-old man arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office\" was released on bail pending further investigation.Police were known to be investigating whether he leaked market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was a government minister during the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010. Mandelson, who was fired in September on orders from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after revelations about his dealings with Epstein, has previously denied any wrongdoing. \"He was arrested at an address in Camden ... and has been taken to a London police station for interview,\" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.\"This follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden area,\" police said. \"We are not able to provide further information at this stage to prevent prejudicing the integrity of the investigation.\"Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords in early February, but retained his title of lord.In a statement then, he said, \"I want to say loudly and clearly that I was wrong to believe [Epstein] following his conviction [in 2008] and to continue my association with him afterwards.\"\"I apologize unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered,\" Mandelson said.The Guardian reported that Starmer's spokesperson told reporters in early February, \"The prime minister believes that Peter Mandelson should not be a member of the House of Lords or use the title.\"However, the prime minister does not have the power to remove it. He is calling on those in the Lords to work with the government to modernise disciplinary procedures in the house, to allow for the easier removal of lords who have brought the house into disrepute.\"Mandelson's arrest came four days after British police arrested Mountbatten-Windsor, brother of King Charles III, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.Mountbatten-Windsor was released later Thursday. While the nature of the investigation into him was not revealed, Thames Valley Police have said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, a Domino's pizza sits in a take-out box on July 21, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesDomino's Pizza shares climbed on a Monday after the company posted a better-than-expected quarter and laid out ambitious growth plans. The strong performance came as the pizza chain said it saw higher transactions and better traction among lower-income diners with its value offerings.The pizza chain reported same-store sales growth of 3.7%, better than the 3.1% projected by Wall Street. Revenue of $1.54 billion was also higher than the $1.52 billion estimated by analysts, at a time when the broader pizza category and restaurant sector at large has faced headwinds. Domino's chief executive told CNBC in an interview Monday that the company is really just getting started, and it aims to double its market share.\"I want people to understand that I think we can double this business, and it's not a stretch, given our track record, and given how we are in other markets, to think we can get there,\" CEO Russell Weiner said.The quarterly report comes at a time when Domino's two biggest public competitors are struggling. Sales rumors are circling both Yum Brands' Pizza Hut, which has been under a recently completed strategic review, and Papa John's. While both Domino's and Papa John's stocks have fallen this year, Domino's stock has fallen about 3.6%, versus a 13.8% drop for its rival. Weiner said the success has come from offering value on Domino's core menu item. In the past, he's called this discounting on the center of the plate.\"The only disruption in the pizza category, is the disruption that we're causing, right? Is the category still growing 1 to 2 percent [and] we're up 11 share points in 11 years,\" he said. \"Two of our major competitors ... the rumor on both of those is they're off for sale. And so if that goes through, we're in a pretty unique place.\"The growth this quarter also came from traffic, or more purchases, instead of ticket, or order value — a rarity in the industry that McDonald's and Starbucks were also able to achieve. Weiner touted strength in spending among lower-income consumers, which grew in the fourth quarter and for the year.He's calling it \"profit power.\"\"We can sustain this price and make money ... why would we want to take price [and] feed less consumers, if we can maintain and grow our franchisees' profitability on this lower price and still take share,\" he said.",

    "body": "A worker unloads packages from a FedEx truck on Cyber Monday in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025.Bess Adler | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Express on Monday sued the U.S. government, seeking a \"full refund\" of the money the shipping giant paid for tariffs unilaterally imposed last year by President Donald Trump, which the Supreme Court ruled last week were illegal.FedEx's suit appears to be the first filed by a major American company seeking a refund for tariffs after Friday's Supreme Court decision.Other companies filed lawsuits staking claims to their refunds before the high court ruled that the tariffs Trump imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. Those suits, whose plaintiffs include retail warehouse club giant Costco, remain pending at the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, the same court where FedEx filed its lawsuit.The Supreme Court, in its ruling on Friday, said the Court of International Trade has \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the IEEPA tariffs.\"Plaintiffs seek for themselves a full refund from Defendants of all IEEPA duties Plaintiffs have paid to the United States,\" Federal Express Corp, and its associated company, FedEx Logistics, said in the new lawsuit.The 11-page complaint names as defendants U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which collects tariffs, its commissioner, Rodney Scott, and the U.S. government.CNBC has requested comment on the suit from CBP and the White House.The suit does not say how much FedEx has paid in IEEPA tariffs since Trump imposed them on most U.S. trading partners last year.But in September, FedEx had said that it expected it would take a $1 billion hit to its earnings for the fiscal year because of U.S. trade policies, not all of which involved IEEPA duties. That dollar amount represents 16% of total earnings for the prior fiscal year.In a note on its website, FedEx said, \"While the Supreme Court did not address the issue of refunds,  FedEx has taken necessary action to protect the company's rights as an  importer of record to seek duty refunds from U.S. Customs and Border  Protection.\"\"At this time, however, no refund process has been established by regulators or the courts,\" the company said. \"We will communicate any relevant information and updates in a timely manner, and we appreciate  your patience as we wait for additional guidance and clarity from the U.S. government and the courts.\"",

    "body": "Shipping containers at the port of Oakland in California on Feb. 23, 2026, following the Supreme Court's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs.Carlos Barria | ReutersThe Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday, but the trade tax turmoil is far from over. Fallout over the ruling is already threatening to further strain global trade relations, and the U.S. economy is likely to suffer, economists told CNBC. In 6-3 decision, the high court ruled that President Trump did not have the legal authority to implement his sweeping tariffs imposed last April under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Trump later leveled new tariffs up to 15% effective immediately on an array of U.S. trading partners, further escalating global trade tensions. European Union leaders expressed dismay over the new tariffs, arguing that the U.S. policy shift would upend trade deals already reached with the EU as well as the U.K. last year. On Monday, the EU again postponed a key vote on its deal with the U.S. The pushback against the latest U.S. tariff threat underscores deep frustration over the president's erratic trade policies, and could push foreign governments to scale back U.S. trade and lead businesses to curb expansion, investment and hiring.The result might hobble the U.S. economy. \"It shifts how trade is done with the largest economy in the world, and that has economic consequences,\" Mike Reid, head of U.S. economics at Royal Bank of Canada told CNBC, referring to the Supreme Court ruling and new tariff push.  DownsideThe trade war drama is likely to contribute to a climate of caution among businesses and foreign governments alike, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, leading to \"nothing but downside,\" for the U.S. economy.\"Businesses don't know\" what's going to happen next, Zandi told CNBC. \"They're going to invest less, they're going to hire less, they're going to be less aggressive in their expansions,\" limiting U.S. growth. Foreign governments could react similarly amid rising uncertainty, leading them to \"continue to pull away from the U.S,\" according to the economist. \"They've got to be pulling their hair out over all of this,\" Zandi said. \"Perceptions of the U.S. are increasingly that we're a poorly managed economy, and objectively speaking, they're right. It's a bit of a mess that feels like it's getting messier.\"That perception could lead to efforts to divert trade away from the U.S. to a variety of other trading partners, including China. China's exports grew 6.6% in U.S. dollar terms last December compared to the same month a year earlier, topping analyst expectations and sending the nation's annual trade surplus to a record, according to Chinese customs data. Imports increased at their fastest pace in three months, the same data showed. Trump trade taxesThe Trump administration will continue implementing its trade policy, and now plans to use a variety of sections in the Tariff Act of 1974, according to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. President Trump is pointing to section 122 of the Tariff Act to justify his new tariffs enacted this weekend, although that section limits their effectiveness to 150 days, until mid-July, after which they would have to be approved by Congress.   But the administration is likely to use sections 232 and 301 of the Tariff Act to supplement its new section 122 tariffs, meaning the U.S. could continue to impose tariffs against its foreign trading partners over the next few years, at least. Others say neither investors nor economists should sound the alarm just yet. The implementation of the new trade taxes \"implies little change in the effective tariff rate or our inflation forecasts in the near term,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note to clients.\"Eventual Section 301/232 tariffs could have an impact on certain goods prices in the future, but details are still highly uncertain,\" Clark wrote. \"While a 10% Section 122 tariff would likely have lowered the effective tariff rate by 3-4 [percentage points], a 15% tariff should keep the effective tariff rate essentially unchanged (if anything, lower by ~1pp or so).While the total impact of the new tariffs remains uncertain, a few things are clear, Zandi said. \"The U.S. is pulling away from the world, and the rest of the world is now pulling away from the U.S.,\" the economist said. \"Deglobalization is a weight on the economy, and ultimately, the end state is a weakened economy.\"— With additional reporting provided by CNBC's Alex Harring ",

    "body": "Home Depot on Tuesday posted a roughly 4% quarterly sales decline, as a sluggish real estate market and selective spending by homeowners continued to weigh on home improvement demand.The company also stuck by the current fiscal year forecast that it shared in December at an investor day. It said it expects full-year total sales growth to range between about 2.5% and 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to be between roughly flat and up 4% from $14.69 in the prior fiscal year. It expects full-year comparable sales growth, which takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, to range from flat to up 2%.Despite the fourth-quarter sales decline, Home Depot topped Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for that period.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said U.S. consumers and the company have \"been in a frozen housing environment for three years\" – and there hasn't been a meaningful thaw. \"What we've seen as an added pressure during the last year has been this increase in consumer uncertainty, a gradual decline in consumer confidence,\" he said. \"And so those are signs we're watching.\"He said customers have told the company that they are concerned about housing affordability and job losses, dynamics that colored Home Depot's outlook for the year.Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.72 adjusted vs. $2.54 expectedRevenue: $38.20 billion vs.  $38.12 billion expectedShares rose about 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday, as Home Depot beat earnings expectations after missing estimates three quarters in a row. Higher interest rates, lower housing turnover and economic uncertainty have challenged the company, as homeowners delay the pricier projects typically spurred by buying or selling a home. As the Atlanta-based retailer waits for business to pick up, it laid off 800 employees and announced a five-day a week return-to-office policy in late January.Yet some investors anticipate an inflection point could be coming for Home Depot, as mortgage rates moderate slightly. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.99% on Monday, matching its lowest level since 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Home Depot's biggest selling season, springtime, is also ahead.McPhail said Home Depot's business was relatively stable throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter, when adjusting for storms. He said the company is gaining market share, even as the sector lags.In the three-month period that ended Feb. 1, Home Depot's net income fell to $2.57 billion, or $2.58 per share, from $3.0 billion, or $3.02 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue dropped from $39.70 billion in the year-ago period. The company said some decline was due to the most recent fiscal year 2025 having one fewer week. The additional week in the 2024 fiscal year contributed $2.5 billion in sales. Comparable sales, an industry metric also called same-store sales, increased 0.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter across the business and 0.3% in the U.S.Store transactions in the quarter across Home Depot's website and stores dropped by 1.6% year over year, but average ticket rose 2.4% year over year. Big-ticket purchases, which the company defines as those over $1,000, were 1.3% higher than the year-ago period.Some of those larger orders may reflect higher prices. McPhail said Home Depot has had \"modest\" price increases, though he declined to say which items and categories now cost customers more.Higher tariffs have been one of the forces driving price hikes at retailers, including Home Depot. Companies now face a new landscape for import duties after the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that some of the Trump administration's tariffs were illegal. Soon after the ruling, President Donald Trump said at a press conference that he would pursue alternative tariffs and proposed an across the board global tariff that he has since set at 15%.He said Home Depot is \"still in the middle of our analysis\" after the Supreme Court ruling and latest proposed tariffs.\"Not all the information is out right now. Not all the language is final around what was announced,\" he said. He added that Home Depot is \"as well positioned as anyone to understand any impacts and manage through them.\" More than half of what Home Depot sells comes from the U.S., according to the company. It's diversifying its imports, so that no single country outside of the U.S. represents more than 10% of the company's purchases, McPhail said.Though do-it-yourself buyers have cut back, the company still has a more stable business segment.A growing business from home professionals, such as contractors and roofers, has boosted Home Depot's overall business. It acquired SRS Distribution, a company that sells supplies to roofing, landscaping and pool professionals, for $18.25 billion last year in 2024 and bought GMS, a specialty building products distributor, for about $4.3 billion last year. Pro sales were stronger than do-it-yourself sales during the fourth quarter, McPhail said, though he declined to share specific figures. Home Depot opened 12 stores in fiscal 2025 and plans to open 15 additional stores this fiscal year.The company also announced on Tuesday that its board of directors increased its quarterly dividend by 1.3%, or 3 cents, to $2.33 per share. It will be payable next month.As of Monday's close, Home Depot shares are down about 2% over the past year, but up about 10% year to date. That compares to the S&P 500's nearly 14% gains over the past year and its roughly flat performance year to date.",

    "body": "Futures-options traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange's NYSE American (AMEX) in New York City, U.S., Feb. 6, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersSpeculative investing tools have boomed in popularity since the Covid pandemic as more retail traders have entered the market, according to forthcoming data shared exclusively with CNBC.Leveraged and inverse funds are expected to see average daily trading volumes of 1.41 billion in 2025, per a report from exchange-traded fund manager Direxion due out on Tuesday. That's a gain of more than 130% from 2024 and 250% from 2020, the firm found.Leveraged funds aim to use derivatives to boost the returns of an underlying asset, but they can also amplify losses. Inverse funds set out to give investors the opposite performance of an underlying asset.Average daily options volume is projected to reach 58 million in 2025, Direxion found. This figure reflects a roughly 26% increase from the prior year and is more than double the amount seen in 2020.\"People have gotten really smart about investing and investing in complex vehicles,\" Douglas Yones, Direxion's chief executive, told CNBC in an interview.Leveraged funds and options trading saw daily volumes grow at compound annual rates of 29% and 16%, respectively, between 2020 and 2025, Direxion found.By comparison, stock volume expanded at a yearly pace of 10%. To be sure, stocks still dwarf leveraged funds and options when it comes to market volume.Direxion's report can signal rising demand for instruments that allow investors to take more risk. It also follows the boom in investing among retail investors during the pandemic that has since turned mom-and-pop traders into a critical force in financial markets.Leveraged fund market growsLast year was a major one for leveraged funds, Direxion said in the report.That's in part because everyday traders had more choices in the space. The total number of active leveraged funds grew by 50% in 2025, marking the largest annual increase since 2007, according to the report. About four out of five leveraged funds in the U.S. track equities, the firm said.Additionally, Yones said Direxion saw increasing interest in lesser-known leveraged funds last year. For instance, he said the Daily South Korea Bull 3X Shares (KORU) gained traction as the Asian country's market rallied.Investors set records for volume and turnover in leveraged funds in April, as President Donald Trump's tariff policy sent markets into a tailspin, the report found.That was part of a pattern last year of traders investing in leveraged bull funds after notable market declines, Yones said. This style of dip-buying helped drive bumper returns for retail traders in 2025.Still, Yones said clients tend to have small sums in leveraged funds compared with more traditional investments. Market participants should think of leveraged funds as \"satellite\" positions within their portfolios and should research them before investing, he said.Yones' team said it's hard to forecast if leveraged funds can expand at the same clip going forward. But he said demand should hold up with traders seeing these products as tools to ride rebounds following market pullbacks.\"We are in a world where we get these massive singular statements, ... particularly around politics, that will move the market very short term, and then the market snaps back,\" Yones said. \"Investors are getting smart about that.\"",

    "body": "Uber to acquire SpotHero.Courtesy: Uber Technologies, Inc.Uber said it's acquiring SpotHero, a company that provides a parking reservation app for crowded downtowns, sporting events and concerts. Terms weren't disclosed, but Uber said on Monday that it plans to offer a \"parking reservation experience, powered by SpotHero\" within its own app to help users find parking for events, venues and airports. \"For the moments when people do choose to drive, SpotHero on the Uber app will make the experience easier than ever, and bring more people into the Uber ecosystem,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. Earlier this month, Uber reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth-quarter but issued soft profit guidance for the current period, sending the stock down. The company's strongest revenue growth for the quarter was in its delivery business, which started with restaurants and now includes groceries and retail.Uber's expansion into new markets and geographies has turned into the dominant U.S. ride-hailing company. Its market cap currently sits at $146 billion, while Lyft is valued at just over $5 billion. Within food delivery, Uber faces stout competition from companies including DoorDash, which has a market cap of over $71 billion.SpotHero last announced outside funding in 2019, when it raised $50 million in a round led by Macquarie Capital. The Chicago-based company launched in 2011, and now says it offers parking at more than 13,000 garages, lots and valets in over 400 cities in the U.S. and Canada.\"Joining forces with Uber will allow us to bring that experience to millions more drivers and make parking a natural part of the Uber platform,\" SpotHero CEO Mark Lawrence said in a statement. Uber said the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of this year.

The U.S. State Department broadened its warning to travelers to shelter in place across multiple regions of Mexico, including the popular tourist hot spots of Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Tulum, Tijuana and Puerto Vallarta.Violence erupted after the Mexican army killed Jalisco New Generation Cartel leader Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes. Known as \"El Mencho,\" he led one of fastest-growing criminal networks in Mexico, notorious for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine to the United States and staging brazen attacks against government officials who challenged it, The Associated Press reported.As roads were blockaded with burning vehicles, airlines canceled flights and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid ports with potential problems.  Carnival Corp. said Princess Cruises' Royal Princess and Holland America Line's Zuiderdam were bypassing their planned stops in Puerto Vallarta on Monday. Norwegian Cruise Line said its ship the Norwegian Bliss has canceled its plans to call on Puerto Vallarta on Wednesday.  MSC Cruises USA said sailings to Cozumel and Costa Maya, Mexico, are currently operating as planned, but that shore excursions may be adjusted or canceled. Though Royal Caribbean said it doesn't have ships currently in the affected areas, CNBC has learned some of its excursions in Ensenada, Mexico, were affected. Airbnb told CNBC it had activated its \"major disruptive events policy\" in Jalisco state and other affected regions. That policy overrides the host's individual cancellation policy, allowing travelers and hosts to cancel reservations without consequences.  \"We are monitoring this situation carefully and are focused on supporting guests and hosts in impacted areas,\" an Airbnb spokesperson said.In a note to investors, Truist travel and leisure analyst Patrick Scholes wrote that Hyatt has the most exposure of the international brands, with 8.5% of its room total coming from Mexico. Marriott has the second-highest exposure, with 3.3% of its overall rooms coming from Mexico.  Typical travel insurance policies often carry exclusions for terrorism, political violence or civil unrest. Squaremouth, an online marketplace for travel insurance, warned would-be travelers that \"the violence in Mexico is now a foreseeable event, or what the insurance industry calls a known event. So tourists can't buy coverage now in order to cancel their trip.\"   However, a Squaremouth spokesperson told CNBC, \"If you are heading to Mexico soon, especially during spring break, buying CFAR [cancel for any reason] or IFAR [interruption for any reason] as add-ons is a smart decision given the uncertainty.\"",

    "body": "A woman and a baby look out of a window of a train in Kyiv, Ukraine. Future Publishing | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesFour years of war between Russia and Ukraine are beginning to take their toll on the countries' demographics as the conflict puts women off — or prevents them — from starting or expanding their families. While the effects of that broad-based hesitancy to have children might not be immediately apparent, a decline in the birth rate can have far-reaching consequences for economies and societies further down the track.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022, Ukraine's fertility rate — the average number of births per woman — has plummeted, exacerbated by the war, the loss of partners and spouses in the fighting, and family separation and mass emigration.In 2021, Ukraine's total fertility rate stood at 1.22 but this has since dropped to 1.00 in 2025, according to United Nations population data. Some have cited a more dire metric, with the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, warning in December that the fertility rate in the country had plunged to 0.8–0.9 children per woman, with the war and insecurity across Ukraine causing this \"critical decline.\"For a society to replace itself from one generation to the next, without relying on migration, a total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary.Russia, too, has also seen a longer-term trend downwards in its fertility rate exacerbated by the war. In 2021, Russia's fertility rate was 1.51 but by 2025, it had dropped to 1.37 children per woman, down from 1.4 recorded the year before.Ongoing trendUkraine and Russia aren't alone in experiencing declining fertility and birth rates — the trend can be seen in a variety of European and Asia countries — and the decreases can be down to several factors, from career and lifestyle choices to economic constraints. A woman carries a baby as she reacts after evacuating from Russian troop-occupied Kupiansk town in a bus convoy, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, on the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine May 30, 2022. Picture taken May 30, 2022. Ivan Alvarado | ReutersBut four years of war appear to have played a big part in deterring or preventing women in Ukraine from having children, while in Russia, women seem resistant to repeated calls from the Kremlin, and President Vladimir Putin, to have larger families.Declining birth rates pose big problems for countries as they have knock-on effects on the economy and society, with few births meaning fewer workers in the labor force in future, as well as lower productivity and economic growth. That means lower tax receipts for governments and extra strain on pension and healthcare systems as an ageing population grows and becomes dependent on a shrinking working population.The fertility and birth rate — referring to the number of live births per 1,000 people each year — had been declining before the war, with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine affecting sentiment toward having children in those regions, Iryna Ippolitova, senior researcher at the Kyiv-based Centre for Economic Strategy, told CNBC. The situation was then made even worse after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. \"Of course, in 2022 it got it even worse because of this massive migration and because the majority of those who left Ukraine were people of working age, economically active people,\" she noted, adding: \"A lot of women who theoretically could have children left, and for those who stayed, the war and uncertainty meant they were unprepared to give birth in Ukraine, and the number of births is still declining.\"Even if peace talks come to fruition and the war ends, Ippolitova said migration out of Ukraine could continue, while those staying in the country could be put off having families if they fear a repeat invasion by Russia. This, she said, was another reason why Ukraine needed security guarantees as part of any peace deal.Maternity units and hospitals have been damaged during the Russia-Ukraine war.

Russia denies deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure.Global Images Ukraine | Global Images Ukraine | Getty ImagesAlthough fertility trends are notoriously hard to predict, and baby booms are often seen after wars end, Ippolitova said the country's low fertility rate could still trouble the Ukrainian economy in the future. Schools and universities were already starting to experience falling numbers of pupils, she said, signaling a smaller working-age population down the line.\"I think that it is a huge problem. We have labor shortages right now, already, and after the war, it will only get worse ... In 10 or 15 years when people my age retire, there will be nobody to replace them on the labor market,\" Ippolitova said.Russia looks for a baby boomDespite being the injured, invaded party in the war, Ukraine is not alone in experiencing declining numbers of births. Russia has seen the same trend over several decades despite Putin promoting larger families as a \"traditional Russian value\" and patriotic duty.The Russian state has introduced incentives for women who have three or more children, including lump-sum payments, tax breaks and state benefits. The Kremlin has even revived the Soviet-era \"Mother Heroine\" award, giving women a cash reward of 1 million rubles (around $13,000) for having 10 or more children.Resistance to such incentives remains, however, with Russia recording 1.222 million births in 2024, the lowest annual total since 1999. In December, Putin said during his year-end press conference that the fertility rate stood at 1.4 in 2025, and suggested Russia needed a baby boom.\"We also have a slight decline [in the fertility rate] — approximately 1.4. We need to achieve at least 2.0,\" Putin said during his annual \"Direct Line\", telling the public that \"we must make the happiness of motherhood and fatherhood fashionable.\"Journalists watch Russian President Vladimir Putin answering questions during the annual \"Direct Line with Vladimir Putin broadcast live\" by Russian TV channels and radio stations at the Gostiny Dvor studio, in Moscow on June 15, 2017.  / AFP PHOTO / Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV        (Photo credit should read KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV/AFP via Getty Images)Kirill Kudryavtsev | Afp | Getty ImagesCritics say Putin's position on the country's low fertility rate boils down to control rather than demographic concerns.\"I strongly believe that Putin's regime's efforts to double down on encouraging births is not related to any kind of demographic trends. This is all about societal control,\" Konstantin Sonin, the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, told CNBC.\"[Russia's authorities] want women to be at home, they want women to be with kids. They want men to care about the women, not about politics,\" Sonin, a prominent Putin critic, said.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to the comments and is awaiting a reply.Sonin argued that Putin had already shown he did not care about demographics by starting the war against Ukraine, with the conflict causing economic instability, labor market shortages and inflation. Efforts by the Kremlin to encourage more births had fallen flat, Sonin said, because women in Russia did not feel safe and secure, with the low birth rate direct evidence of that and effectively dispelling positive images of the country and war promoted by Russia and state-run media.\"There are more important things for any woman, for any young family, than just how much money in a direct cash transfer they will receive from the state. What matters for them is the general feeling of safety. And this is not there in Russia,\" Sonin said.\"The quality of life has fallen since the beginning of the war. Hundreds of thousands of young people are dead because of the war, so people suddenly feel much less safe than they felt in other circumstances.\"",

Moller-Maersk and Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Co.The notice formalized a Supreme Court ruling last month that the concessions for the Balboa and Cristobal terminals near the Panama Canal, which Panama Port Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, had held for more than two decades, were unconstitutional.The Panamanian government on Monday formally assumed control of the port facilities, including cranes, vehicles, computer systems and software under a decree aimed at ensuring uninterrupted operations until a new concession is awarded within 18 months.  Under the interim arrangement, APM Terminals, a unit of Maersk, will operate the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal, while MSC's port operating subsidiary, Terminal Investment, will run the Cristobal port on the Atlantic side. In a statement to CNBC Tuesday, Maersk said APM Terminals has begun temporary operations at the Port of Bolboa for a period of up to 18 months. \"One of the main tasks will be the deployment of a new terminal operating system and the training of the workforce in this new system,\" the shipping group said.  Separately, CK Hutchison said PPC had ceased all operations at the terminals on both sides of the canal on Monday, while describing the executive decree \"unlawful.\"  The Hong Kong conglomerate said it would continue to consult legal advisors regarding the ruling and takeover. The Hong Kong-listed shares of CK Hutchison closed 2.6% lower on Tuesday following the court-ordered takeover, denting the year-to-date gains to around 15%, according to LSEG data.  Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCK HutchisonCNBC reached out to MSC for comment but did not receive a response by publication.The simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfire.After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was \"running the Panama Canal,\" CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port assets. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  \"kowtowing\" to American pressure and stalling the transaction. watch nowThe Hong Kong conglomerate has pushed back since the ruling last month and initiated arbitration proceedings against Panama. On Feb. 12, CK Hutchison said that \"any steps\" that Maersk or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely \"result in legal recourse.\" Beijing also warned that the Central American country will \"pay a heavy price both politically and economically\" unless it changes course.The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities. China has reportedly directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and urged shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week.— CNBC's Emily Chan contributed to this story.",

Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Monday accused three Chinese AI enterprises of engaging in coordinated campaigns to extract information from its model, making it the latest American tech firm to level such claims after OpenAI issued similar complaints.According to a statement from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax — the three firms in question — engaged in concerted \"distillation attack\" campaigns, flooding Claude with large volumes of specially-crafted prompts to train proprietary models.Through distillation, smaller AI models are able to mimic the performance of larger, pre-trained models by extracting knowledge from the better-trained model, a technique particularly useful for smaller teams with fewer resources.Despite Anthropic's service restrictions preventing commercial access to Claude in China, the three firms allegedly engaged commercial proxy services to sidestep Anthropic's restrictions, enabling access to networks running tens of thousands of Claude accounts simultaneously.\"Once access is secured, the labs generate large volumes of carefully crafted prompts designed to extract specific capabilities from the model,\" Anthropic said in the statement.Claude's responses to these prompts are farmed en masse either for direct training of the Chinese models, or to run a process known as reinforcement learning, a data-intensive process where AI models learn decision-making through trial and error, in the absence of human guidance.Anthropic estimated that the three Chinese firms were collectively able to generate over 16 million exchanges with Claude from around 24,000 fraudulently created accounts. Of the three enterprises, Anthropic found MiniMax to have driven the most traffic, with over 13 million exchanges.DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax have yet to respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Not the first timeAnthropic joins a growing chorus of American companies expressing concerns over distillation from Chinese AI firms.Earlier this month, Sam Altman's OpenAI submitted an open letter to U.S. legislators, claiming to have observed activity \"indicative of ongoing attempts by DeepSeek to distill frontier models of OpenAI and other US frontier labs, including through new, obfuscated methods.\"The company has flagged evidence of distillation by Chinese firms since early last year, with the launch of China's first DeepSeek model, which users found strikingly similar to ChatGPT, the Financial Times reported in Jan. 2025, citing insiders from OpenAI.Distillation, however, is not an uncommon practice in the AI industry. Anthropic acknowledged in the Monday statement that AI firms \"routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions.\" The company was, however, concerned with the competitive advantage rival firms stand to gain, as the practice can be used \"to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.\"In their respective statements, Anthropic and OpenAI have framed distillation by these Chinese firms as national security threats. watch nowLike OpenAI, who described DeepSeek's practices as \"adversarial distillation,\" Anthropic expressed concern over the possibility of \"authoritarian governments deploy[ing] frontier AI for offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance.\"It remains unclear, however, how much these statements reflect genuine security concerns over a desire to preserve the competitive lead of America's AI corporations.Some online users were quick to point out the similarities between Anthropic's claims and its own use of distillation to train proprietary models.Anthropic has long framed \"compute leadership as a national security priority,\" consistently advocating for tighter export controls of advanced AI chips to China, according to Rui Ma from boutique consulting firm Tech Buzz China.\"Whether intentional or not, the narrative of illicit capability transfer strengthens the case for stricter chip restrictions,\" Ma added.On the same day of Anthropic's statement, Reuters reported that the U.S. had found evidence of DeepSeek training its AI model on Nvidia's flagship Blackwell chip, apparently flouting export controls, according to anonymous senior officials.Such reports add fodder to concerns from an administration that appears increasingly anxious over China's rapid advancements in the AI industry, especially as China's gains reportedly arise from the use of American-developed systems.Last Friday, the White House announced the establishment of the Peace Corps, an initiative within the Peace Corps established to promote American AI interests abroad, and to help partner nations adopt cutting-edge systems.",

    "body": "From left, MangoAI's Nirmal Govind, Canva Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer Cliff Obrecht and MangoAI's Vinith Misra.CanvaSoftware stocks have been hammered in recent weeks as investors worry about threats from artificial intelligence. In the startup world, Canva has been among the highest fliers due to its popularity with designers, but that market is showing vulnerability, with larger rival Adobe down 30% so far this year.As Canva reckons with dramatic changes in the market, the design software vendor is getting acquisitive. The company said Monday that it's purchased two startups — Cavalry and MangoAI — that stand to help it challenge Adobe. Cavalry, a four-person startup, sells subscriptions to software for creating two-dimensional animations. MangoAI is a stealth-mode company, whose technology can be used for creating short videos for advertising. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed.Cameron Adams, Canva's co-founder and product chief, told CNBC that customers have been asking what the company can offer in motion graphics. Cavalry, which Canva has used for its own projects, has gained attention among designers on social media as an alternative to Adobe's After Effects for some work. Canva will continue to operate Cavalry for people to use and buy independently, while also incorporating the animation technology into the core Canva product and the Affinity application for professional designers. Canva bought Affinity in 2024 and made it free in October.Amazon, ByteDance, Google, and OpenAI all have employees that are paying customers, according to Cavalry's website.Canva plans to incorporate MangoAI into the Canva Grow advertisement generator, which is available through its business tier at $250 per person per year. The MangoAI technology is able to track video performance and make recommendations. \"There's a whole bunch that goes into creating the right video,\" Adams said. That includes \"being able to cut stuff down, being able to repurpose content from other campaigns and put it together, being able to take a great call to action that happens at the end of one video and then append it to the hook that happens in another video,\" he said.\"Analyzing all of that across your campaigns is the full vision of Canva Grow, and Mango will help enable that,\" Adams added.Canva said it ended 2025 with over $4 billion in annualized revenue, up 36% from a year prior. Adobe reported $6.2 billion in revenue for the November quarter, up 10%. Adobe's market capitalization stood at $101 billion on Monday, while Canva said in August that it had been valued at $42 billion in a secondary share sale, before the recent plunge in software stocks.Adams said Canva has seen instances of people directing generative AI models to create content such as slide presentations and social media posts. But AI can't do everything, he said.\"AI is great at getting you to 80%,\" Adams said. \"That last 20% where you're confident that you can push this piece of content out and truly represent your brand and speak to your audience and achieve the goals that you want to achieve is vital to have, and that last 20% is really tricky to do.\"Canva, which now has over 5,000 employees, is not currently raising a new funding round, Adams said.\"Our revenue growth has not stopped, our user growth has not stopped, and the quality of our product is getting better and better with the inclusion of AI,\" he said.WATCH: Investors are paying less and less for software earnings these days, says Jim Cramerwatch now",

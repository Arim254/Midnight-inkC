    "body": "A decade ago, I boarded a one-way flight from Houston to Madrid with a suitcase and a rough plan to teach English for a year. I was 35, and I knew I needed a change.As the daughter of Colombian and Iranian immigrants growing up in Texas, I never quite felt like I belonged anywhere. That changed when I moved to Spain in 2015. I've built a life here centered around community, freedom, and balance.Along the way, I figured out the logistics, visas, and mindset shifts it takes to start over abroad. Now, through my platform She Hit Refresh, I help other women over 30 figure out their own moves.I still visit the U.S. often, and there's plenty I love about coming back, including family, friends, and my annual TJ Maxx run. But after 10 years in Europe, there are quite a few things I don't miss about life in America.1. Just 10 days of PTOWhen I first moved to Spain, I couldn't believe how normal it was for people to actually use their vacation days. Here, full-time employees are legally entitled to 22 working days of paid leave, plus 14 national holidays. And no one feels guilty about taking them! Offices slow down in August, families head to the beach, and it's completely accepted that you'll be out for a few weeks to rest and reset.Back in the U.S., I used to hoard my 10 precious PTO days like gold. Asking for time off felt like letting my coworkers down. I'd sometimes end up leaving days unused or checking emails during vacation.The lack of freedom wore me down. I became a chronic job hopper in my 20s, quitting every nine months or so just to travel for the summer. It wasn't sustainable, but it was the only way I could see the world.2. Car dependencyWhen I lived in Texas, I couldn't survive without my car. Grocery store? Drive. Gym? Drive. Life revolved around traffic, parking, and gas prices. I didn't realize how exhausting it all was until I left.Madrid, where I first lived, and Málaga, where I am now, are incredibly walkable. Most of what I need is within a 20-minute stroll, including markets, cafes, and my coworking space. When I can't walk, I take the bus or metro, which are clean, reliable, and inexpensive. For longer trips, the high-speed trains make it so easy to explore the rest of the country, even if you're on a budget.Cepee Tabibian in Budapest.Courtesy of Cepee TabibianWalking everywhere has done wonders for my stress levels. Instead of sitting in traffic, I get to start and end my day with fresh air and sunshine. I feel more connected to my neighborhood — I know the baker, the grocer, and even the street cats. Plus, I hit my step count without even trying.3. GoFundMe-style healthcareThe U.S. healthcare system used to be one of my biggest stressors. Every doctor's visit felt like spinning a roulette wheel; you never knew what surprise bill you'd get. Finding a primary care doctor meant endless calls, and I constantly worried about what would or wouldn't be covered.In Spain, it's the complete opposite. Healthcare is affordable, accessible, and straightforward. I book appointments through an app, wait times are short, and I pay about $76 a month for private coverage as a healthy 45-year-old.4. A sense of danger in public placesAs a woman, I feel safer walking home at night in Spain. Spanish cities are denser, well-lit, and full of life late into the evening with families strolling, people dining outdoors, and kids playing in the plazas.In the U.S., I was always on alert. Whether it was walking through a parking lot after dark or attending a crowded event, there was a constant, low-level anxiety around harassment and gun violence. Spain's strict gun laws help. Automatic weapons are prohibited and firearm ownership is tightly controlled. The Global Peace Index ranks Spain among the 25 most peaceful countries in the world, while the U.S. doesn't even crack the top 100.5. Tipping guilt Every time I visit the U.S., I'm shocked at how out of control tipping has become. Even if you're grabbing a cookie at a bakery or using self-checkout, the screen flips around with options sometimes starting at 20%!Cepee Tabibian in Cádiz, Spain.Courtesy of Cepee TabibianIn Spain, where service staff earn fairer wages, rounding up or leaving a few coins at restaurants is a small token of appreciation, not an expectation. And you'll never be asked for a tip for your morning pastry.6. Extreme patriotism and polarizationOne thing I see more clearly since leaving the U.S. is how surrounded Americans are by intense political division. Don't get me wrong, Spain has its own complexities — different regions with their own identities, languages, and politics — but the overall energy feels less combative.There's less of that \"best country in the world\" mentality that often comes from people who've never actually seen the world. The U.S. does many things well, but so do plenty of other countries, Spain included.7. Pressure to follow a traditional timeline As a woman in the U.S., I felt the societal expectation that by 35, I was supposed to be married with kids. I wasn't, and that made me feel like I was behind.In Spain, where the average age to get married is 38.8 (compared to 30.8 in the U.S.), it's completely normal to be single and childfree in your 30s and 40s. It's great to go out and see plenty of people your age and older at social events, bars, and more. When I moved here in my mid 30s, I felt far less judgment for being unattached and not having children.Of all the things I don't miss, this might be the most impactful one. Letting go of that pressure to follow a traditional timeline gave me the freedom to build a life I love.Cepee Tabibian is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

    "body": "Last month, J.D. Power released its annual North American Airport Satisfaction Study for 2025.Mega airports are defined as those with 33 million or more passengers per year. The study measured overall passenger satisfaction by examining their experiences across seven core dimensions in order of importance:Ease of travel through airportLevel of trust with airportTerminal facilitiesAirport staffDeparture/to airport experienceFood, beverage and retailArrival/from airport experienceThe 2025 study is based on 30,439 completed surveys from U.S. or Canadian residents who traveled through at least one U.S. or Canadian airport and covers both departure and arrival experiences (including connecting airports) during the past 30 days. The study was conducted from July 2024 through July 2025.\"While the annual growth rate in passenger volume seems to be leveling off, we're still seeing record numbers of travelers pass through the nation's airports, and, for the most part, they are enjoying the experience,\" Michael Taylor, practice lead for the airport study at J.D. Power, stated in a press release.Just like 2024, the top three airports remain the same, which isn't surprising, Taylor tells CNBC Make It.\"The three airports that won performed solidly in what I call blocking and tackling. It's about getting to the airport, is the bathroom clean? Is the TSA quick? That kind of thing and then the most important part is the food, beverage and retail which is the biggest swing factor in the study usually,\" he says.With the government shutdown still ongoing, air travel is being affected but hasn't changed the satisfaction rankings of the mega airports in this year's report yet, Taylor says.His biggest piece of advice during this time is that travelers should be prepared to not go anywhere.\"Prepare not to be in the air and seeing more delays,\" he said. \"People will react negatively to that, which will affect satisfaction, but it's generally fairly episodic. It doesn't last forever and we haven't seen a huge impact.\"Minneapolis-Saint Paul International is the best 'mega airport' in North America — againThe Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport ranked No. 1 on the list, scoring 660 out of 1,000.The airport is ideally located between Minnesota's two major cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul.\"From start to finish, Minneapolis has a really good relationship with its state's Department of Transportation because signage is very critical to have a good airport experience,\" Taylor says. \"They have actual highway signs that tell you which terminal you're going to. That's kind of unusual in the United States. They do a really good job of bringing Minnesota into the airport itself.Minneapolis-Saint Paul International AirportStar Tribune Via Getty Images | Star Tribune | Getty ImagesThe airport served more than 37 million travelers in 2024, making it the 18th busiest in North America in terms of the number of passengers served annually, according to MSP's website.In 2023, the airport ranked as the world's most punctual, according to a report from the travel data analytics firm Cirium.The 10 best 'mega airports' in North AmericaMinneapolis-Saint Paul International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportDallas/Fort Worth International AirportHarry Reid International AirportJohn F. Kennedy International AirportOrlando International AirportMiami International AirportSan Francisco International AirportBoston Logan International AirportThe Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport took the No. 2 spot this year with a score of 649 out of 1,000.\"Detroit is a solid airport. They've improved their food, commercial, and retail, and brought more of Detroit into the airport,\" Taylor says. \"They have a simple setup, so it gives a feeling of space, and people get to spread out. They're less stressed, and TSA does an awesome job, and people get through very quickly.\"Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportEmily Elconin | Getty Images News | Getty Images",

    "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves speaks on stage during the Labour Party conference on Sept. 29, 2025, in Liverpool, England. Ian Forsyth | Getty ImagesU.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has reiterated her commitment to the government's self-imposed fiscal rules, but said it must be honest with the public about the challenges the country faces.Speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso on the sidelines of the IMF's Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Reeves cited the Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East and the impact of global trade barriers as key challenges.\"The key thing for me is that as Chancellor, I'm determined ... to be honest with people about the challenges that we face,\" she said. \"I will respond to those at the budget.\"On Nov. 26, Reeves will deliver her second Autumn Budget since becoming chancellor of the Exchequer. The policies announced in the upcoming budget come as the U.K. grapples with a faltering economy, inflated prices and elevated government borrowing costs.watch nowReeves would not be drawn on individual measures in the budget, such as the possibility of a bank tax, but said she wanted the U.K. to be competitive for businesses to \"start up, to scale up and to grow.\"\"We want Britain to be seen globally as the place to trade, the place to invest, the place to do business, and the place to bring global talent,\" Reeves said.She added that the U.K.'s financial regulators must take into account growth, not just risk.Reeves has come under sustained pressure since last year's Autumn Budget, when she announced strict rules that limited the government's room for maneuver on spending and borrowing. Under her fiscal rules, day-to-day government spending must be funded by tax revenues and not borrowing, and Reeves has also pledged to ensure public debt is falling as a share of economic output by 2029-30.Earlier this week, however, she hinted that in order to meet these conditions, she may have to break an earlier manifesto pledge not to raise taxes for working people. Her other options are breaking her own fiscal rules or finding more ways to slash the government's outgoings.All of those options would be unpopular with voters.Markets on edgeBreaking her own self-imposed fiscal rules could spook financial markets. When questions arose earlier this year about Reeves' future within the government, bond markets staged a drastic reaction that suggested investors were keen for her to remain in her post and stick to the rules.With the U.K.'s 30-year government bond yields trading at well over 5%, the country's government has the highest long-term borrowing costs of any G-7 nation.Reeves declined to comment on bond moves, but said markets could see that the government was continuing to meet its fiscal rules, adding that she would continue on the path to fiscal consolidation.\"We know that the deficit has been running too high for the last few years, and as chancellor, I'm determined to reduce those costs of borrowing, bring down the debt, and ensure that we have a growing economy based on that platform of fiscal responsibility,\" she added.Previous efforts to cut the country's welfare bill were thwarted when lawmakers within Reeves' own party refused to back her plans, resulting in concessions that effectively wiped out £5 billion ($6.7 billion) of savings.Last year's tax raid on businesses also faced pushback, with many firms saying they were reluctant to hire staff as a result.— CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Amazon Web Services Inc. signage at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, on March 20, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon Web Services, a leader in the cloud infrastructure market, reported a major outage on Monday, taking down numerous big-name websites. Many now show signs of recovery.The issue began shortly after midnight PDT in AWS' main US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications.DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load.AWS cited an \"operational issue\" affecting \"multiple services\" and said it was \"working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,\" in an update at 2:01 a.m. PDT. More than 70 of its own services were affected.Shortly afterward, AWS said it was seeing \"significant signs of recovery.\"By 3:35 a.m. PDT, the issue had been \"fully mitigated,\" AWS said in an update, adding that most AWS service operations \"are succeeding normally now.\"\"Some requests may be throttled while we work toward full resolution,\" it said, noting some services were continuing to work through a backlog.Major companies hitThe website Downdetector said that user reports indicated problems at sites including Amazon, Disney+, Lyft, the McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Ring, Robinhood, Snapchat, T-Mobile, United Airlines, Venmo and Verizon.British government websites Gov.uk and HM Revenue and Customs were also experiencing issues, per Downdetector.A government spokesperson told CNBC: \"We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\"Lloyds Banking Group confirmed some of its services were affected and asked customers \"to bear with us\" while it works to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online.Reddit, too, is \"working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,\" a spokesperson told CNBC.Some United and Delta customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.Graphic design tool Canva said it was \"experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.\"Generative AI search tool Perplexity is also affected. \"The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it,\" CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a post on X.Centralized softwareIt's not the first time major companies have been affected by a technical issue; in July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed just how fragile global technology infrastructure is when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.\"There's no sign that this AWS outage was caused by a cyber attack - it looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,\" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN said in a statement. \"These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.\"\"This incident is a reminder that cybersecurity isn't only about defending against threats - it's also about resilience. Businesses should plan for technical failures as seriously as they do for cyber attacks, ensuring they have redundancy, backup systems, and multi-cloud strategies to keep services running when the unexpected happens,\" he added.Indeed, \"DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,\" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it \"is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.\"\"We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,\" he added. \"This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.  When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.\"— CNBC's Leslie Josephs and Annie Palmer contributed to this report.",

    "body": "China Shipping containers are seen at the port of Oakland as trade tensions continue over U.S. tariffs with China, in Oakland, California, on May 12, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersBEIJING — China's economy grew 4.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in a year but in line with analyst expectations despite the ongoing real estate slump.Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year as spending on infrastructure and manufacturing slowed. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% growth.Property investment extended its decline, sliding 13.9% in the year through September, compared with a 12.9% drop during the first eight months of the year.The drop in fixed-asset investment is \"rare and alarming,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. He warned that fourth-quarter GDP growth faces downward pressure.The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.\"Weakness in real estate investment may persist for a longer period than previously anticipated,\" Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School, said in Chinese, translated by CNBC.\"This could represent a structural restructuring, and it's possible that investment will never return to its prior levels,\" he said. \"In this context, China needs to consider how to leverage investment from other sectors to fill the investment gap.\"Industrial production climbed 6.5% in September, topping expectations for a 5% increase and up from 5.2% growth in the previous month.Excluding property, fixed-asset investment for the first three quarters of the year rose by 3%, down from 4.2% as of August, according to official data. Private sector investment outside real estate rose 2.1% for the year through September, also slower than the 3% recorded as of August.\"The weakness in investment spending, especially by the private sector, reflects a lack of confidence in the economy's growth prospects as well as in government policies that could support growth,\" Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University, said in an email.Modest consumer spendingRetail sales rose 3% in September from a year ago, matching analyst forecasts. In a sign of waning support from China's consumer goods subsidy program, sales of home appliances rose by a modest 3.3% in September, compared with a surge of 25.3% for the first three quarters of the year.\"I don't think we could stimulate domestic demand without stabilizing the housing market first,\" Dan Wang, Eurasia Group, said Monday ahead of the data release on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"China's Statistics Bureau said disposable income for city residents rose 4.5% in the first three quarters of the year after adjusting for price changes, while rural residents saw a 6% increase.The urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.2% in September from 5.3% the previous month.However, retail sales slowed from 3.4% year-on-year growth in August, while third-quarter GDP slowed from 5.2% growth in the previous quarter.Official data for September also showed continued resilience in China's exports despite tensions with the U.S.The core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy, rose at its fastest pace since February 2024. But headline inflation fell 0.3%, missing expectations as deflationary pressures persisted.Earlier Monday, China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for a sixth-straight month, in line with expectations, with the one-year loan prime rate at 3% and the five-year rate at 3.5%.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's top leaders are meeting from Monday to Thursday to discuss policy and development goals for the next five years.Beijing has sought to shift the economy toward domestic consumption for growth, while developing homegrown technology in the face of rising U.S. restrictions.\"China should step up its efforts in tech, but we also firmly believe the so-called old economy will remain the backbone of the economy for the foreseeable future,\" Nomura Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a note last week. \"Beijing will have to clean up the property sector mess in 2026-30 for several reasons.\"He noted that real estate remains second only to exports in contributing to China's GDP, while about half of household wealth is in property, and that the sector still accounts for about 18% of local government revenue. Overinvestment in new industries such as electric vehicles \"has already become counterproductive,\" Lu said.",

    "body": "Trading cards of the game \"Magic\" are located in a shop where a \"Magic\" tournament is taking place.Frank Rumpenhorst | picture alliance | Getty ImagesAs screentime soars and technology races ahead, a low-tech pastime is back in a big way: collecting trading cards.The cardstock depicting everything from NFL standouts to Pokémon and even Taylor Swift is one of the hottest toy categories in stores this year. Big-box retailers are stocking up ahead of the holidays, anticipating that demand will extend beyond traditional toy buyers like children and collectors.\"We see trading cards being a hot gifting category for all ages that we will fuel with newness and with exclusive drops,\" Rick Gomez, Target's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, told CNBC. \"We're going to have new releases nearly every week during the holidays that's going to drive demand. And these make for great gifts and great stocking stuffers.\"Strategic trading card sales — which exclude sports — are up 103% year-to-date through August, while non-strategic card sales, which tend to be collectible pop culture or sports cards, are up 48%, according to market research firm Circana.Target's trading card sales are up nearly 70% year-to-date, with annual revenue from the category expected to top $1 billion.Sales on some online platforms are rising even faster. Walmart Marketplace reported a 200% jump in trading card sales from February 2024 to June 2025, with Pokémon sales up more than tenfold year-over-year during the same period, the company first told Axios. The retailer has even launched a new weekly influencer livestream series focused on sports collectibles.Since 2021, strategic card sales have grown by $891 million, or 139%, to total $1.5 billion, according to Circana. Sales of non-strategic cards and collectible stickers climbed by $565 million, or 156%, to $925 million in the same period, Circana said.Millennials and Gen Z customers have been crucial for growth, said Juli Lennett, vice president and industry advisor for Circana's U.S. toys practice.\"Lots of adults are buying these because it brings them back to a time when they had no cares in the world,\" Lennett said. \"It's an affordable luxury with the economy right now. Some couldn't afford cards as kids and now they have their own money and no one's there to say 'no'.\"Some buyers also treat cards like alternative investments. Through August, the value of Pokémon cards has delivered a cumulative return of 3,821% since 2004, according to an index by analytics firm Card Ladder, the Wall Street Journal reported. To combat online resellers, many stores now limit purchases to two packs per customer.While the trading card category has boomed this year, not everyone is convinced the segment will boost sales during the peak holiday shopping season. Within the past six months, 19% of adults said they purchased Pokémon cards for themselves, signaling they may not be buying them for others in the weeks ahead, according to Circana.\"There has been steady growth in the category, but a large chunk of buyers are purchasing for themselves. There isn't as much gifting here as you see in other toys,\" Lennett said.Pokemon cards released in 1999Yvonne Hemsey | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesA year-round rushWhat trading cards may lack in holiday flair, they make up for in consistency.Cards stand apart from most toy categories in two key ways: they are frequently self-purchased and not \"super seasonal,\" Lennett said.\"Cards sell just as well in March or July as they do in December,\" she said. \"That makes them very attractive to retailers trying to offset seasonal risk.\"Target, which often gets a bump from merchandise tied to holidays, has tried to capitalize on the year-round fervor for cards.\"We expanded our assortment. We increased the number of drops that we have. We put trading cards in a more prominent place in store, did bolder displays and the business has responded,\" Gomez said. \"We don't see the business slowing and we see it continuing to grow in popularity.\"Pokémon remains the category's top performer, with card sales topping $1 billion last year — it's the first toy brand to hit that milestone in the U.S., according to Circana. Sports cards are also becoming more popular, particularly among teen boys, with NFL packs leading the charge.\"A lot of different people are coming in to buy. You have your adult collector who's buying for themselves, but we also see a lot of families coming in with kids requesting them and asking their parents for trading cards,\" Gomez said. \"It's a great gift for parents, for kids, especially if they know that they're into sports or Pokémon.\"While contemporary releases are booming across people aged eight to 28, vintage cards — typically pre-1970s — haven't connected as strongly with Gen Z and Gen Alpha collectors.\"The majority of my customers aren't looking for vintage,\" Matthew Winkelried, CEO of New York-based Bleecker Trading, told CNBC. \"Younger people don't want to dig through 1960s cards unless they see a Mickey Mantle or Hank Aaron. Plus, the scarcity and price of vintage cards make it a tough entry point.\"Topps trading cards are arranged for a photograph in Richmond, Virginia.Jay Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChanging customersAfter a near-collapse in the 1990s due to overproduction, the trading card industry has rebounded. Growth has been particularly strong since the pandemic, propelled by a blend of nostalgia, community and, for some, investment potential.For many, cards offer a sense of belonging — whether it's exchanging cards or playing a game like Pokémon or Magic: The Gathering.\"You still have the game players, and that's a really tight-knit community,\" said Jason Howarth, senior vice president of marketing and athlete relations at Panini America, which supplies sports cards to retailers like Target and Walmart. \"Among sports fans, there's a huge sense of camaraderie around trading. And with Pokémon too, I've heard game nights still play a major role in keeping that ecosystem alive.\"For those looking to cards as a store of value, Pokémon cards often prove to be a stronger investment than their sports counterparts, said Winkelried of Bleecker Trading.\"Maybe a highly touted rookie joins the league, and you buy their card early hoping it'll rise in value,\" he said. \"The value can change week to week. It's volatile like a stock.\"He added: \"Pokémon is like a commodity. Pikachu can't tear an ACL or get a DUI. Supply is limited, so the market is more stable.\"Looking past the holidays, major retailers are focusing on building the category's long-term future. Target is betting on exclusive sets, limited specialty drops and drawing a more diverse consumer base.\"We are looking at reaching not only breadth of age with trading cards, but also gender,\" Gomez said.That process is already underway. The WNBA is now one of the fastest-growing segments in sports cards, particularly among young girls.And with the 2026 FIFA World Cup spanning the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, soccer is poised to surge next.\"Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese have done wonders for the WNBA trading card business,\" Howarth said. \"Once it hits June, the U.S. marketplace is going to be taken over by soccer. Fans already know the global stars like Messi, but with the World Cup being held here, at least four or five players will skyrocket in popularity and get recognized.\"",

    "body": "Among Americans' favorite romantic comedies are \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" according to a series of 2023 YouGov polls.In those and the many romcoms like them, the plot is fairly simple: The female lead pines after a man, they end up together, often after a series of kooky encounters. The end. The trope echoes a long-held belief about male-female dynamics.\"There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men,\" says Justin Lehmiller, senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, \"and that women would be more inclined to commit faster to a relationship.\"But a recent DatingNews.com and Kinsey Institute study of 2,000 U.S. singles refutes that claim.More than a quarter, 28.6% of men would speed up their move-in timeline in a relationship and 18.8% would marry sooner, according to the study. That's as compared to 18.8% of women who'd move in faster and 13.7% who'd marry sooner.According to Kinsey's findings, their motivating factor is financial: More men would speed up these milestones to save money.And that should come as no surprise, given the current economic climate, with job openings and hiring slowing and tariffs pushing prices higher. But, experts say there's more to it.There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men.Justin LehmillerSenior research fellow, Kinsey InstituteFor heterosexual men in particular, \"romantic relationships really become their primary source of social and emotional support,\" says Lehmiller. \"And so when men don't have that in their lives, we see that their levels of psychological well-being are lower.\"It's a trend Geoff MacDonald, scholar of singlehood and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, knows well. MacDonald's MacLab focuses on wellbeing in singlehood and has found that women are more likely to be happy single than men.\"Women are just better at getting that kind of support through their friendships and through their family relationships,\" MacDonald says. \"Men tend to struggle with that more on their own.\"That could be as a result of cultural pressure, Lehmiller says.Traditional notions of masculinity \"restrict when and how men are able to express their emotions,\" he says. \"So they don't tend to get as close to their male friends or to have other people in their lives that they have close intimate relationships with.\"Romantic relationships help men meet those needs.Researchers aren't the only ones seeing men's eagerness to couple up. Kyle Scheinkman has been working at relationship coaching company Relationship Hero since 2018, first as a coach to clients and now as the director of coaching. The company's 100 or so coaches primarily offer services within the romantic relationship context, from relationship strengthening to help for those looking to find a partner.\"Generally speaking, men are more likely to sign up for coaching,\" he says. \"They're more likely to have more sessions and to spend more on coaching in the long run.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samina Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"Correction: Samina Virk is the Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective.

He than reiterated the issue in September, writing in a post on social media that other countries have \"stolen\" the movie-making business from the U.S.The U.K.'s film industry has already faced multiple challenges in recent years from Box Office sales struggling to recover their pre-pandemic levels to rising competition from streaming platforms, the SAG AFTRA strikes and now the threat of film tariffs.Gurinder Chadha, director of blockbuster movies \"Bend it Like Beckham\" and \"Bride & Prejudice,\" is set to release a new film this Winter called \"Christmas Karma,\" based on Charles Dickens' classic, \"A Christmas Carol.\"  The director told CNBC it's a \"miracle\" that she's been able to make the film, given the challenges faced by the industry.  \"I'm not sure that tariffs are practical, but I think we have to look at the message behind that, which is that every country is trying to protect its own film industry,\" she said.Audience members wear 3D spectacles to watch a movie.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStill, the British film and TV sector is a bright spot for the economy, contributing billions of pounds through production spending, which reached £5.6 billion ($7.5 billion) last year, according to the British Film Institute (BFI).\"We know that it's worth — about 126 billion pounds a year — our creative industries. Quite often, people think about film and television as being things that make you feel good, things that entertain you, but actually they create thousands and thousands of jobs and huge amounts of inward investment across the U.K.,\" said Caroline Dinenage, a member of parliament and chair of the U.K.'s Culture Media and Sports Committee.U.S. dependencyFrom Pinewood to Shepperton, U.K. studios depend heavily on U.S. partnerships. Last year, 65% of total U.K. production spend on film came from U.S. studios and streaming platforms, per a BFI report.Without this stateside contribution, it would be more difficult to make British movies, according to film director Howard Berry. \"We are quite reliant on the U.S. investing into the U.K. to make films. We have to wait for them to say we're going to make a film, and then we scramble around to make it happen,\" he said.\"We're not so great at having a pot of money for the U.K. to say we're going to make U.K. films. And so if that money doesn't happen anymore, we're kind of stuck. We don't have that huge amount of investment to make our own films.\"Modern filmmaking is a collaborative process, with scripting, filming, post-production, and music development often worked on across different countries. This makes it difficult to enforce tariffs, according to the Vue CEO Tim Richards.\"I think because of the complexities, because there are other ways of actually implementing and getting to the same place, through tax credits, even what Gavin Newsom has been proposing as well in California, that there are other means of achieving the same goals without having the impact on the industry,\" Richards said, referring to California Governor Gavin Newsom.This summer, Newsom increased the total film and TV tax credit to $750 million in California, nearly doubling the previous cap, in a bid to encourage more productions to film in Los Angeles.\"How do you define what is going to be actually hit by these tariffs? That's what everyone's really been focusing on,\" he added.watch nowZygi Kamasa, CEO of British-based theatrical distributor True Brit Entertainment, said that U.S. movie tariffs could result in the U.K. collaborating more with other nations.\"A lot of our films that we made over the years, that we made in Britain, travel very well to Europe and Asia. And I think we'd look at co-production opportunities more out of the European territories to bolster the financing opportunities.\"For now the cameras keep rolling – but many within the industry are hoping the U.K. government will take action.When Trump first called for 100% tariffs on movies, a spokesperson from the U.K. government told local media that it was not in the national interest to provide a \"running commentary\" on trade matters with the U.S. They added that the British film industry is \"world-class.\"\"It's a really important thing for our prime minister to be discussing with the U.S. government, and I think it should definitely be front and center of any future trade discussion,\" said Dinenage.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersTop proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Tesla investors vote against a pay plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock.The \"mega performance equity award\" to Musk, designed to retain the CEO long-term, \"has an astronomical grant value conditioned upon far-reaching performance targets that, if achieved, would create enormous value for shareholders,\" ISS wrote on Friday.Tesla's 2025 annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote is scheduled for Nov. 5. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. ISS said that while some shareholders may support the pay plan, \"there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.\"Musk's plan, if approved, would be the largest ever awarded to a public company CEO. It could could net Musk up to an additional 12% stake in Tesla, should the company hit a market cap of $8.5 trillion and achieve other goals.Tesla disagreed with the ISS recommendations.In a post on X, which is owned by Musk, the automaker accused ISS of missing \"fundamental points of investing and governance,\" and complained that the advisors had previously \"recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).\"The company urged shareholders to vote with the board's recommendations on all proposals on the 2025 proxy.ISS previously advised investors to reject a \"ratification\" of Musk's 2018 CEO pay package, which was worth an estimated $56 billion at the time.The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 pay plan had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. The ruling said Tesla hid crucial details from shareholders that they were entitled to before voting, and that Musk had controlled the board.Musk has appealed that court's decision to the Delaware State Supreme Court, with opening arguments in the appeal heard by a panel of judges this week.Representatives for ISS declined to comment beyond the report.ISS, along with Glass Lewis and smaller peers, can influence how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Musk accused ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023 of effectively controlling the stock market because of their influence with passive or index funds in some matters. He also baselessly compared ISS to a terrorist organization.Musk will be able to vote his own shares in the vote concerning his future pay. He holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, according to the most recent available disclosures on his stake. Those holdings alone could be enough to secure approval for the nearly $1 trillion pay package.In September, Musk added to his ownership of Tesla stock buying another $1 billion worth of shares.Among other ISS recommendations, the firm also suggested that shareholders should vote against giving Tesla's board authorization to invest in xAI, the AI company that Musk started in March 2023 but only disclosed publicly in July that year. Tesla has sold tens of millions of dollars worth of its Megapack battery energy storage systems to xAI.ISS also recommended against voting to reinstate Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis, a longstanding and close friend of Musk.In May, Tesla changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue for a breach of fiduciary duties so that only a shareholder that owns at least 3% of the company's stock can bring what's called a \"derivative\" action. Ehrenpreis presided over Tesla's governance committee at the time that change was made without a shareholder vote.WATCH: Former Tesla board member says it's hard to argue with valuationwatch now",

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and chief executive officer of Anthropic, at the World Economic Forum in 2025.Stefan Wermuth | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence startup Anthropic is doing all it can to keep pace with larger rival OpenAI, which is spending money at a historic pace with backing from Microsoft and Nvidia. Of late, Anthropic has been facing an equally daunting antagonist: the U.S. government.David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, has been publicly criticizing Anthropic for what he's called a campaign by the company to support \"the Left's vision of AI regulation.\"After Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark, AI startup's head of policy, wrote an essay this week titled \"Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,\" Sacks lashed out against the company on X.\"Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,\" Sacks wrote on Tuesday.OpenAI, meanwhile, has established itself as a partner to the White House since the very beginning of the second Trump administration. On Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, Trump announced a joint venture called Stargate with OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank to invest billions of dollars in U.S. AI infrastructure.Sacks' criticism of Anthropic hits on the company's very foundation and its original reason for being. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in late 2020 and started Anthropic with a mission to build safer AI. OpenAI had started as a nonprofit lab in 2015, but was rapidly moving towards commercialization, with hefty funding from Microsoft.Now they're the two most highly valued private AI companies in the country, with OpenAI commanding a $500 billion valuation and Anthropic capturing a valuation of $183 billion. OpenAI leads the consumer AI market with its ChatGPT and Sora apps, while Anthropic's Claude models are particularly popular in the enterprise.When it comes to regulation, the companies have very different views. OpenAI has lobbied for fewer guardrails, while Anthropic has opposed part of the Trump administration's effort to limit protections.Anthropic has repeatedly pushed back against efforts by the federal government to preempt state-level regulation of AI, most notably a Trump-backed provision that would have blocked such rules for 10 years.That proposal, part of the draft \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" was ultimately abandoned. Anthropic later endorsed California's SB 53, which would require transparency and safety disclosures from AI companies, effectively going in the opposite direction from the administration's approach.\"SB 53's transparency requirements will have an important impact on frontier AI safety,\" Anthropic wrote in a blog post on Sept. 8. \"Without it, labs with increasingly powerful models could face growing incentives to dial back their own safety and disclosure programs in order to compete.\" Anthropic didn't provide a comment for this story. Sacks didn't respond to a request for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump sits next to Crypto czar David Sacks at the White House Crypto Summit at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S.,  March 7, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersFor Sacks, the priority in AI is to innovate as fast as possible to make sure the U.S. doesn't lose to China.\"The U.S. is currently in an AI race, and our chief global competition is China,\" Sacks said in an onstage interview at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference in San Francisco this week. \"They're the only other country that has the talent, the resources, and the technology expertise to basically beat us in AI.\"But Sacks has adamantly denied that he's trying to take down Anthropic in the process of lifting up U.S. AI.In a post on X on Thursday, Sacks contested a Bloomberg story that linked his comments to growing federal scrutiny of Anthropic.\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he wrote. \"Just a couple of months ago, the White House approved Anthropic's Claude app to be offered to all branches of government through the GSA App Store.\"Rather, Sacks claimed that Anthropic has cast itself as a political underdog, positioning its leadership as principled defenders of public safety while pursuing a public campaign that frames any pushback as partisan targeting.\"It has been Anthropic's government affairs and media strategy to position itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration,\" Sacks said. \"But don't whine to the media that you're being 'targeted' when all we've done is articulate a policy disagreement.\"Sacks pointed to several examples of what he sees as adversarial actions. He referenced Dario Amodei's comparison of Trump to a \"feudal warlord\" during the 2024 election. Amodei publicly supported Kamala Harris' campaign for president.Sacks also referenced op-eds the company ran opposing key parts of the Trump administration's AI policy agenda, including its proposed moratorium on state-level regulation and elements of its Middle East and chip export strategy. Anthropic also hired senior Biden-era officials to lead its government relations team, Sacks noted.The AI czar took particular umbrage to Clark's essay and his warnings about the potentially transformative and destabilizing power of AI.\"My own experience is that as these AI systems get smarter and smarter, they develop more and more complicated goals. When these goals aren't absolutely aligned with both our preferences and the right context, the AI systems will behave strangely,\" Clark wrote. \"Another reason for my fear is I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in a very early form.\"Sacks said such \"fear-mongering\" is holding back innovation.\"It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem,\" Sacks wrote on X.watch nowAnthropic has also stayed away from actions that many other tech companies have taken explicitly to appease Trump.Leaders from Meta, OpenAI, and Nvidia have courted Trump and his allies, attending White House dinners, committing tens of billions of dollars to U.S. infrastructure projects, and softening their public postures. Amodei wasn't invited to a recent White House dinner involving numerous industry leaders, the company confirmed to The Information.Still, Anthropic continues to hold major federal contracts, including a $200 million deal with the Department of Defense and access to federal agencies through the General Services Administration. It also recently formed a national security advisory council to align its work with U.S. interests, and began offering a version of its Claude model to government customers for $1 per year.But Sacks isn't the only influential Republican tech investor voicing his critique of the company.Keith Rabois, whose husband works in the Trump administration, waded into the mix this week.\"If Anthropic actually believed their rhetoric about safety, they can always shut down the company,\" Rabois wrote on X. \"And lobby then.\" WATCH: Anthropic's Mike Krieger on new model releasewatch now",

    "body": "Comfort Colors t-shirts are seen on Oct. 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCWhen looking through Wyatt Cannon's T-shirt collection, there's a common theme: the Comfort Colors label.Growing up, Cannon would often find Comfort Colors apparel when looking for souvenirs during family trips. In college, Cannon convinced his a cappella group to screen print on the company's blank shirts. When the 24-year-old has made tie-dye T-shirts for himself, it's with Comfort Colors product.\"I've loved this brand my whole life,\" said Cannon, who estimates around half of his shirts are Comfort Colors. \"This kind of material and texture and vibe of T-shirt should just be more of the standard.\"Cannon is part of a loyal and growing base of consumers driving demand for the half-century-old, Gildan-owned shirt brand. The label's ballooning success in recent years can help explain Gildan's stock outperformance and has led to plans for an expansion into additional product categories. Comfort Colors t-shirts.Courtesy: Watt CannonGildan is tight-lipped about specific brand performance and declined to share Comfort Colors' sales data with CNBC. But company executives have said Comfort Colors took off, especially over the last year, and has become a leading brand within Gildan, which also sells apparel under its namesake label and American Apparel.\"Comfort Colors is probably the fastest-growing fashion brand,\" Glenn Chamandy, Gildan's co-founder and CEO, said during a call with analysts earlier this year. \"When you walk into a souvenir store today, you'll see Comfort Colors on every single one of those tables where you used to see fashion brands before.\"'Knocking it out of the box'Gildan acquired Comfort Colors for around $100 million in 2015 in hopes of expanding within the basics category of North America's printwear market, according to a press release announcing the deal. At the time, Gildan called the Vermont-based apparel maker \"one of the most recognized brands\" in places like college bookstores and resorts.The brand publicizes that its shirts are 100% cotton from the U.S. Its \"pigment pure\" dyeing system creates the shirts' \"signature faded look\" and requires less energy and water use than other comparable processes, Gildan says.Comfort Colors' popularity exploded in 2024 with around 40% year-over-year growth, company executives have said on earnings calls. That helped drive sales in Gildan's broader activewear category up 6% in the same period.Chamandy told analysts in late July that Comfort Colors is \"knocking it out of the box again this year\" and helped drive the activewear category up 12% in the second quarter. The brand is planning to expand into hats, bags and women-specific clothing in 2026 as it rings in its 50th anniversary, Howard Upchurch, marketing and merchandise chief at Gildan, said in a statement to CNBC.Gildan, which announced earlier this year it was acquiring Hanesbrands as it further builds out its basic apparel business, is expected to report earnings at the end of this month.U.S.-listed shares of Gildan, which is a Canadian-based company, have surged more than 175% over the last five years. That's almost double the widely followed S&P 500's return over the same period.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGildan vs. S&P 500, 5-year chartThough Gildan has touted Comfort Colors as a success story within its larger empire, consumers haven't necessarily made the connection. Cannon said he views Comfort Colors as \"crunchy\" and \"granola,\" while Gildan feels like the \"peak of consumption capitalism.\" The Connecticut-based marketing manager said Comfort Colors' unique tag of woven fabric is one quality that makes the brand feel more \"homey.\"A 'good spot'On Etsy, printers hawk Comfort Colors shirts with various designs and some even allow shoppers to upload their own. The brand has also gotten a boost from TikTok, where content creators share videos of their Comfort Colors products that viewers can purchase via the platform's shopping feature.Relative search volume for Comfort Colors in the U.S. spiked to all-time highs on Google this year, underscoring the brand's growing awareness among consumers. On the other hand, Gildan has tumbled in search popularity from a peak in 2023.Comfort Colors has amassed a \"very loyal\" base made up particularly of Gen Z customers, according to Sheng Lu, an associate professor at the University of Delaware whose research focuses on the apparel industry.These young shoppers value comfort and vintage flair, both of which align with Comfort Colors' products, Lu said. Comfort Colors' emphasis on sustainability can also bode well with a customer base that's conscious of their environmental footprint.\"This brand definitely is in a very good spot,\" Lu said.Comfort Colors' rise is particularly interesting given that the brand focuses more on selling in bulk than directly to consumers, unlike other T-shirt makers like Nike, Lu said. He explained that since Comfort Colors is mainly selling product via middlemen who can screen print on them, the shirts end up appearing more unique — which is another desirable quality for Gen Z shoppers.Behind the scenes, Gildan is likely benefiting from Comfort Colors' sourcing in the Western Hemisphere, Lu said. While countries in this region have been hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the levies have typically been less steep than those slapped on Asia, he said. Because shoppers tend to view T-shirts as a staples, these items may show stability even when consumer sentiment falls, Lu said.Frats to folkPlus, across the country, Comfort Colors shirts are outfitting social groups and sitting on merchandise stands at events. Musical acts including Maggie Rogers and Mumford & Sons printed tour merchandise on Comfort Colors shirts. Brands ranging from Coors Light to Star Trek sell its apparel, as do local bars and eateries. Women's soccer team Gotham Football Club has several official Comfort Colors spirit wear shirts.When Chelsea Green opened The Yard Milkshake Bar, she already knew of Comfort Colors from seeing the brand on college campuses. She said it's the most popular type of merchandise for The Yard Milkshake Bar, particularly with younger shoppers who are familiar the brand and sometimes use the shirts for sleepwear or as beach coverups.\"I knew that I had Comfort Colors T-shirts already in my closet,\" Green said. \"I was like, 'that's what I want.' I didn't even research it.\"To be sure, Green acknowledged that the shirts can be pricier than some competitors' and she at times ran into supply shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the color options and quality have made  overcoming these obstacles worthwhile, she said.Social organizations such as Cannon's collegiate a cappella group have also turned to Comfort Colors. Similarly, fraternity Sigma Chi and sorority Pi Beta Phi each sell dozens of Comfort Colors shirts in their online shops.On a fraternity-focused Reddit forum, a user asked what T-shirt brands people used for screen printing. One respondent said Comfort Colors is their \"go-to.\" Use Comfort Colors, another said, \"or you're at risk of getting tar and feathered.\"",

Some of those concerns have come to fruition, but the industry has proven to be far more resilient than many had expected.\"Six months into the onset of tariffs, we've been positively surprised by the extent to which the industry has held in better than anticipated,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an investor note last month that upgraded the U.S. auto/mobility sector to \"neutral\" from \"negative.\"The neutral rating by Barclays speaks volumes to the state of the automotive industry right now, according to auto executives, insiders and analysts who say circumstances aren't as bad as they once feared — but also that they still aren't as positive or certain as they could be.S&P Global last week released a new report explaining how tariff burdens have eased, but noting that demand headwinds persist amid slowing disposable income growth, consumer pessimism and fluid trade policies. The government shutdown also adds uncertainty to the economic outlook, the firm said.Jim Farley, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, speaks at a Ford Pro Accelerate event on Sept. 30, 2025 in Detroit, Michigan. Bill Pugliano | Getty ImagesThe cautiousness followed S&P revising its U.S. light vehicle sales estimates upward by about 2%, to 16.1 million vehicles for 2025, and to 15.3 million, up 200,000, in 2026.Part of what's driven the unexpected optimism have been industry sales and production holding up much better than expected, in addition to broader macroeconomics such as consumer spending being relatively stable.\"The [economic] outlook is getting better, and part of it is realizing that tariffs didn't end the world, and that applies to the auto market as well,\" Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke told CNBC. \"I think we can navigate it, and I'm holding on to that optimistic outlook.\"Such optimism will be tested as major automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Tesla begin reporting third-quarter results this week.Each of the American automakers is expected to report double-digit declines in adjusted earnings per share but remain profitable on an adjusted basis, according to analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.\"We expect Q3 earnings that [are] generally in line to slightly above expectations. Industry production did come in better than expected,\" Wolfe Research analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in an Oct. 10 investor note. \"But as always there are nuances to consider.\"Balancing actThe automotive industry is in a bit of a balancing act.Tariffs have cost automakers billions of dollars this year, but deregulation of fuel economy penalties, as well as corporate gains under the Trump administration's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" are expected to help offset those costs, Ford's Farley and others have said.Meanwhile, there are red flags of stress in auto lending for lower credit buyers, including the recent bankruptcy of subprime auto lender Tricolor — but sales and pricing of new vehicles through the third quarter remained far better than many had expected.\"There's some positives for next year, but there could also be some really bad negatives if there's a freak out on tariffs or the consumer finally breaks down or whatnot,\" Morningstar analyst David Whiston told CNBC. \"But no one's calling for a complete crash.\"Fronts of the GMC Sierra Denali,Tesla Cybertruck and Ford F-150 Lightning EVs (left to right).Michael Wayland / CNBCWhiston — who covers GM, Ford and several auto retailers and suppliers — characterized his outlook as \"cautiously optimistic,\" saying the significant industry concerns are countered by other bullish circumstances.UBS analyst Joseph Spak agreed, noting a lot of challenges for automakers such as tariffs and losses on electric vehicles \"have already been incorporated into 2025/2026 estimates,\" he said in an investor note last month.In addition to the economic and political concerns, the automotive industry faces significant changes in all-electric vehicle adoption that caused GM last week to pre-report $1.6 billion in special charges during the quarter related to its pullback in EVs.Adding to this year's \"chaos,\" especially for Ford, is a fire last month at aluminum supplier Novelis that is impacting vehicle production. Wall Street analysts estimate the fire to cost Ford between $500 million to $1 billion in operating income.\"The industry is in a lot of flux. It faces an array of challenges,\" Elaine Buckberg, a senior fellow at Harvard University and former GM chief economist, said regarding tariffs, EVs and other issues. \"The level of volatility they've faced over the last seven years or so is unlike what came before.\"SuppliersThe broader supplier industry remains a major potential concern for automakers, as it did to begin the year.The automotive supplier industry is made up of thousands of companies — ranging from multibillion-dollar publicly traded corporations to \"mom and pop shops\" making one or two parts — that industry experts say cannot support many, if any, additional cost increases.\"The market has been under pressure. It's fragile,\" said Mike Jackson, executive director of strategy and research for vehicle supplier association MEMA. \"Those suppliers that are flexible and agile have been able to reposition themselves to be successful despite the changes, despite the shifts.\"Autolite spark plugs at an auto parts store in Provo, Utah, on Monday, Sept. 29, 2025. First Brands Group Holdings has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, capping weeks of turmoil sparked by creditor concern over the auto-suppliers use of opaque off-balance sheet financing. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNot all have been able to compete successfully. The bankruptcy of U.S. auto parts maker First Brands Group in late September heightened concerns on Wall Street about the health of the private credit market. First Brands had a web of complex debt agreements with a slew of lenders and investment funds globally.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last week called the bankruptcies of First Brands and Tricolor Holdings \"early signs\" of excess in corporate lending, while some Wall Street analysts have written them off as idiosyncratic.Executives have said automakers, also known as OEMs, or original equipment manufacturers, have so far done their best to assist suppliers when needed and have not passed on added tariff costs to such companies, but it's unclear how long that may last.\"Suppliers clearly are working as hard as they can with their customers to try and mitigate the impact, understating it's an important issue to work through,\" Jackson said. \"That said, there have been a number of different cost pressures that we've seen that go beyond the tariffs. … It varies by customer, by OEM.\"Shares of many larger publicly traded suppliers, such as Aptiv, BorgWarner, Dana and Adient, are up double digits so far this year. Even Canada-based Magna International, which at one point was expected to be one of the companies most impacted by tariffs, is up roughly 7%.Those gains are despite the third quarter marking the 14th consecutive quarter of building pessimism by North American auto supplier executives, according to MEMA's most recent \"Vehicle Supplier Barometer\" released earlier this month.Adding to supplier concerns are ongoing issues with tariffs between the U.S. with Mexico and Canada as well as the Trump administration's ongoing trade war with China, where many rare earth materials, some of which are used in vehicles, are processed and sourced.watch nowK-shaped concernsThere are also continuing concerns that the automotive industry is an example of a K-shaped economy in the U.S., where the wealthy keep seeing gains while those who have lower incomes struggle.Economists have warned the U.S. economy is increasingly \"K-shaped\" following the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers experiencing different realities depending on their income level.Used vehicle retailer CarMax was the first major auto-related company to sound the alarm on the consumer late last month.\"The consumer has been distressed for a little while. I think there's some angst,\" CarMax CEO Bill Nash told analysts earlier this month, with an auto lending executive for the used car retailer warning the \"cracks\" are \"an industry issue.\"watch nowBut that \"issue\" appears to only be for lower income consumers or those with subprime credit, many of whom are not new car buyers.Wealthier Americans have been assisted by rising house values, lucrative stock market returns and favorable credit, while lower- and middle-income buyers have faced tighter budgets and have been hit hard by rising inflation.Fitch Ratings reports 6.43% of subprime auto loans in August were at least 60 days past due, in line with a record high of 6.45% that was hit in January. Delinquency rates for borrowers with higher scores have remained relatively stable.\"Clearly there is concern about the consumer, because if you're not in the upper part of the 'K' then yes, there is stress,\" Cox Automotive's Smoke said. \"But it tends to be a demographic story about median and below income households.\"About two-thirds of new vehicle purchases are made by people whose household income is above the median, according to Buckberg. The U.S. household median income last year was $83,730, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimatesThat percentage could continue to grow and impact sales if tariff costs begin getting passed on to new car buyers or the whiplashing regulatory chaos barrels more into the automotive industry.\"That's really the big question for 2026. I think everyone in the industry is assuming consumers are going to start to get tariffs passed down to them for autos. They haven't really yet,\" Whiston said. \"How does the consumer react to that? Will they just take it in stride, pay more and keep going? Or will it just cause a massive freak out? No one knows the answer to that yet.\"",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesA judge ordered that X and xAI's lawsuit accusing Apple and OpenAI of trying to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets must remain in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, despite \"at best minimal connections\" to that geographic area by any of the companies.Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic four-page order on Thursday, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, given their preference for the antitrust lawsuit to be heard there.In a footnote, he even flagged the companies to the website of the Business Services unit of the City of Fort Worth \"to get the process started\" of relocating there.Pittman's order implicitly aims at the tendency of some plaintiffs of a conservative bent to file lawsuits in the Fort Worth division of the U.S. Northern District of Texas courts to increase their chances of winning favorable rulings from the two active judges there, both of whom were appointed by Republicans.Those plaintiffs have included X and Tesla, both controlled by mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who, until earlier this year, was a top advisor to President Donald Trump.Pittman was appointed by Trump, but has been critical of the practice of targeting lawsuits to specific judicial districts, known as forum-shopping.In his order on Thursday, Pittman said that the Fort Worth division's docket is two to three times busier than the docket of the Dallas division, which has more judges.Pittman's order noted that neither Apple nor OpenAI has a strong connection to Fort Worth, other than several Apple stores.\"And, of course, under that logic, there is not a district and division in the entire United States that would not be an appropriate venue for this lawsuit,\" Pittman wrote.X Corp. is headquartered in Bastrop, Texas — roughly 200 miles south of Fort Worth — while both Apple and OpenAI are headquartered in California. Musk's xAI acquired his social media company X in March in an all-stock transaction.\"Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth, the numerous high-stakes lawsuits previously adjudicated in the Fort Worth Division, and the vitality of Fort Worth, the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth,\" the judge wrote.\"Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse,\" Pittman said.The judge had asked the three companies to explain why the case belonged in the Fort Worth court.But neither Apple nor OpenAI requested that the case be moved before the judge's Oct. 9 deadline, Pittman noted in the order.Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

This case contains at best minimal connections to the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas,\" Pittman wrote. \"Possibly one of the strongest points made by Plaintiffs is the mere fact that 'Apple sell[s] iPhones [in this Division] (and many other products) and OpenAI offer[s] ChatGPT nationwide.'\"\"After more than a decade of service presiding over thousands of cases in three different courts, the undersigned continues to feel strongly that '[v]enue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiffs' whim where and how a lawsuit is filed,'\" the judge sniped.But Pittman noted that he had little, if any, choice in the decision to keep the suit in his courthouse.The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes federal courts in Texas, has raised \"the standard for transferring venue to new heights,\" Pittman wrote.Last year, the 5th Circuit twice slapped down orders by Pittman to transfer to Washington, D.C., a lawsuit by trade groups representing large banks challenging a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which capped credit card late fees at $8 per month.The 5th Circuit said Pittman's court \"clearly abused its discretion\" in trying to move the case.OpenAI declined to comment to CNBC, referring a reporter to its public filings in the lawsuit. X and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk's X and xAI sued Apple and OpenAI in August, alleging the companies of an \"anticompetitive scheme\" to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets.The lawsuit accused Apple of favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store rankings and deprioritizing other competitors, such as xAI's Grok.Earlier this month, a judge in Washington, D.C., blocked Musk's request to move the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit over his alleged improper disclosure of his stake in Twitter to Texas. Musk renamed Twitter to X after purchasing the company.",

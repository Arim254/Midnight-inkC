    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - United States Grand Prix - Circuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas, U.S. - October 23, 2022  Tim Cook waves the chequered flag to the race winner Red Bull's Max Verstappen.Mike Segar | ReutersApple reports fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell.The fourth quarter, which runs through the end of September, is the first quarter that includes a little more than a week of sales of the new iPhone 17 models.Analysts have said that early signs are pointing to improved demand for the iPhone 17 models, especially the entry-level and Pro models. Investors will be looking for any color from CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh on the demand they're seeing for the new devices.Analysts polled by FactSet expect Apple's fiscal 2025 to be the first year of iPhone sales growth since 2022.Apple has also been negatively affected by Trump administration tariffs, although the company has gotten praise from President Donald Trump over its plan to spend $600 billion in the U.S. and boost American semiconductor manufacturing. Apple also announced last week that it was shipping artificial intelligence servers from a factory in Houston.In July, Apple said it could incur $1.1 billion in tariff costs. Investors will be watching to see if its actual costs came in under its forecast, as well as what tariff costs it sees in the current quarter.Some investors want to see Apple step up its level of capital expenditure and AI spending. Apple has largely sat out the data center and AI chip investment boom that other large tech companies are spending tens of billions on.Last quarter, Cook said that it was \"significantly\" growing its investments in the technology. That will likely show up in the company's capital expenditures, but commentary from Cook may provide insight into the company's AI strategy.Cook will also likely praise the company's five-year deal with F1 to broadcast its races in the U.S. on Apple TV, the latest development in the company's sports and media strategy.Expectations remain high for Cook and Apple. In the June quarter, Apple reported 10% year-over-year revenue growth. For the September quarter, analysts polled by LSEG are expecting 7.7% sales growth.Here's what Wall Street is expecting, per LSEG estimates:EPS: $1.77Revenue: $102.24 billionAnalysts polled by LSEG expect Apple to guide to $132.31 billion in December quarter sales, and earnings of $2.53 per share.",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate this week, mortgage rates responded by doing just the opposite.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped 20 basis points since Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut on Wednesday and held a news conference, according to Mortgage News Daily.This happened the last time the Fed lowered its rate as well, and the reason is pretty simple: the bond market had already priced in a cut, but it didn't like the commentary from Powell.On Tuesday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed had fallen to 6.13%, matching the recent low on Sept. 16, which was the day before the Fed announced its last cut, and marking the lowest level in a year.Then this week, after the Fed said it would reduce rates and Powell answered questions in a news conference, that rate shot up 14 basis points on Wednesday and rose another 6 basis points on Thursday, to 6.33%, an even 20 basis points higher than where it was Tuesday. The last time around in September, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage went even higher, to 6.37%.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The market's enthusiasm for 3 Fed rate cuts in 2025 had grown a bit too large for the Fed's liking,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, in a client note. \"The market was nearly 100% certain of another cut in December. The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower rates did not, however, move the needle much for potential homebuyers.",

    "body": "A Chipotle logo is displayed on a sign at a shop on June 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled as much as 19% in trading Thursday after the company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Including Thursday's move, the stock has fallen 45% this year, dragging its market value down to roughly $43 billion. At least five Wall Street analysts have cut their price targets for the stock after the report, anticipating investors' displeasure with the burrito chain's shrinking traffic and gloomy outlook.\"It's difficult to call a bottom for sales given the multitude of factors weighing on demand,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a research note, revising his price target from $54 to $44 per share.In the third quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.3%, but the chain's traffic fell. While many restaurant chains have suffered in recent years as diners wracked by inflation eat out less, analysts were unsure if the chain's value perception contributed to Chipotle's issues. While its burritos and bowls average about $10, consumers often assume its average prices are closer to the $15 entrees of its fast-casual peers, executives said on the conference call.\"While we knew that traffic had slowed for Chipotle into the fall, we were surprised by the magnitude that was reported last night and the resulting deleverage this produced,\" BTIG analyst Pete Saleh wrote in a note. \"We're admittedly perplexed by how suddenly this traffic weakness came about, and not convinced affordability concerns are the main driver here.\"watch nowCEO Scott Boatwright said on Wednesday's earnings conference call that diners are visiting less frequently, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, a key demographic for the company. Same-store sales have worsened so far in October, and the company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will shrink in the fourth quarter and fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year.\"We are very concerned that the menu and marketing actions taken so far have not sufficiently offset the traffic retraction,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said.Still, most analysts attributed the slowdown to industrywide challenges, not company-specific issues that Chipotle needs to address. Unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation are weighing on consumers' spending, according to Boatwright.\"We believe the brand remains fundamentally healthy (stable share of customer restaurant wallet) and expect a return to growth as the macro improves,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle's weak performance bodes poorly for its fast-casual peers, like Sweetgreen and Cava. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour called fast-casual restaurants \"This Season's Halloween Scare\" in his research note covering Chipotle's earnings report.Shares of Sweetgreen fell 6% in trading Thursday, while Cava stock was down 8%. Both are slated to report their third-quarter results next week.Correction: The company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year. An earlier version misstated the percentage move.",

    "body": "A Honda sedan moves down the assembly line on Jan. 28, 2025 at the automaker's assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Michael Wayland / CNBCGlobal automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co.The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced.Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions.\"The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. \"And every day we are pushing actions and projects to extend our period. There is a day-by-day management of what is an industrywide global issue.\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSuch \"war rooms\" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020.Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market.\"Suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity,\" MEMA, the largest vehicle supplier association in the U.S., said in an emailed statement. \"Chips and diodes are foundational to automotive components and systems, from infotainment systems to door handles, to steering and braking. Even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles.\" NexperiaThe situation involving Nexperia began late last month, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry.German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic.A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation,\" ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility.A Nexperia spokesman referred to a previous statement from the company, which summarized the ongoing situation and said it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions and working to mitigate the impacts of the decision.A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company \"will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so.\"\"Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security,\" the spokesperson said via an emailed statement.Fluid situationHonda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\"We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers,\" Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a \"fluid\" situation.The impacts are expected to continue to spread to other automakers if a resolution is not found.Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a \"political issue,\" saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it.\"It's an industrywide issue. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry,\" said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten \"really good\" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021.General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an \"industry issue\" that will hopefully be resolved soon.\"While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate,\" she said during the company's quarterly earnings call.Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media.\"This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle,\" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve meeting that wrapped up Wednesday both delivered on expectations and offered a few surprises. Here are five key takeaways:The Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, delivered its quarter percentage point rate cut, but not without some backstage intrigue that included two dissenting votes — one in each direction. While Governor Stephen Miran delivered a widely anticipated \"no\" vote because he preferred a half-point reduction, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid wanted no cut, speaking for what is an apparently growing group of inflation hawks who are worried about the Fed's easing bias.Using uncharacteristically strong language, Chair Jerome Powell pushed back hard on another cut in December for which markets had been assigning about a 90% probability of happening. \"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\" He went on to note there were \"strongly different views\" expressed by the 19 meeting participants and noted that the tone would be reflected in the meeting minutes, released in three weeks.Markets knew the end of QT was coming, but just weren't set on when. The committee laid that to rest and said quantitative tightening, or allowing assets to roll off the Fed's $6.6 trillion balance sheet, would end after the November operations. While Powell doused talk of a December cut, ending QT then could have a similar impact. At the same time, the committee indicated it would be reinvesting maturing mortgage notes in short-term bills, which Powell said will tilt the balance sheet to shorter duration with an even stronger lean toward Treasurys.On the question of inflation, Powell gave indications that it is drifting back towards the Fed's 2% goal but remains elevated — around 2.8% by the Fed's preferred measure. Tariffs are providing a boost to that number in the half percentage point range, but Powell said the view continues to be that the impact from the levies will be temporary. The inflation forecast for October is significant in that the Commerce Department will not be releasing an official number on the personal consumption expenditures price index due to the government shutdown.Powell gave a nod towards the uncertainty from the shutdown, but said the lack of public data likely doesn't change the economic picture, one of moderating growth, rising unemployment and \"somewhat elevated\" inflation. \"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public and private sector data that have remained available suggests that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" he said.What they're saying:\"He kind of did a WWE slam on those expectations of a December rate cut. [The door is] not completely closed, I guess, but it was expected to be a foregone conclusion. And he came out pretty vociferously and said, 'Nope, better not think about it that way.'\" — Dan North, senior economist at Allianz\"So, regardless of the use of alternative data sources the Fed can draw on, we believe there is an increased chance that December's meeting may skip a cut, which would push off further accommodative rate moves into the new year, and potentially to a new Chair.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and finalist for Powell's job when his term as chair expires in May\"He tried to say it is not a foregone conclusion, but a December rate cut still seems likely. No Fed leader wants to be responsible for a slowdown or a recession.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesAmerican shippers were already unhappy about their business outlook after President Donald Trump imposed steep new tariffs on China in April.And they were not feeling much happier on Thursday, even after Trump announced a new trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The consensus among U.S. shippers and logistics managers is that the deal is largely rhetoric and that it does not change the substance of the disagreements on trade between the two nations.The note that tariffs on Chinese imports, even after the 10-percentage-point cut announced, remain high enough to put a serious dent on import volume.The effective rate on Chinese imports is still around a minimum of 47% because tariffs are layered on top of each other depending on the physical characteristics of individual imports.Alan Baer, the CEO of the trucking company OL USA, told CNBC on Thursday, \"Uncertainty remains at the forefront of every client conversation as we look out to 2026.\"watch now\"Risk management of inventory levels combined with avoiding tariff variability is a central theme for the first half of 2026,\" Baer said.Before Trump and Xi met in South Korea, the effect of the American president's on-again, off-again tariff threats was seen in U.S. Customs data on containers arriving in the United States from China.\"Apparel has taken the biggest hit so far, with woven apparel down more than 50% and knitted apparel down over 40%,\" said Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion, which aggregates trade data for logistics managers.\"Furniture and toys show the steepest drops by total volume, falling between 20 to 25%,\" Tracy said on Thursday.New data from Vizion shows that year-to-date, the number of containers shipped from China is 2.9 million, which is 700,000 fewer containers than shipped during the same period in 2024 The same data also shows that there are currently 247,000 containers from China on the water headed to the United States. That is about 50,000 fewer containers on the water during the same month in 2024.Fewer containers to ship means lower profits for trucking companies, warehouse firms, and railroads.The markedly lower container volume is reflected in the Logistics Managers' Index, a key metric that  tracks inventory levels, warehouse costs, transportation capacity, and pricing.The LMI over the past two months suggests the freight industry might be headed for a recession.LMI authors have said that a negative index trend would need to continue for at least three months it would indicate an actual recession.John Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said that the deal announced by Trump, which cuts so-called fentanyl tariffs on Chinese imports from 20% to 10%, \"certainly provides relief to companies, especially if it leads to further de-escalation of tariffs between the U.S. and China.\"While the tariff rate is still high with the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs in place, it is a much better alternative we were facing with an additional 100% tariffs,\" Gold said.But he said the remaining tariffs are \"harmful\" and that \"we encourage the administration to continue negotiations with China, as well as other trading partners\" to remove those duties.",

    "body": "UNIVERSAL STUDIOS, ORLANDO, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES - 2019/07/18: Comcast sign logo in the wall of a building at Universal Studios. (Photo by Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images)Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesComcast topped Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates for the third quarter on Thursday, but revealed widespread pressures in its broadband unit that spooked investors.The company said it lost 104,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, bringing its total subscriber base to roughly 31.4 million. This marked the fourth quarter in a row that Comcast failed to grow its broadband customer base. Earlier this year the company outlined initiatives meant to drive broadband growth — the cornerstone of Comcast's business — as it has faced fraught competition from alternative providers, namely 5G companies. The company, soon to be led by co-CEOs Brian Roberts and Mike Cavanagh, will be even more reliant on connectivity in the new year after its planned Versant transaction to offload cable network assets. During Thursday's call with investors, Cavanagh reiterated the \"broadband environment remains intensely competitive.\"Comcast leadership said the broadband business will experience a decline in earnings as its strategy to focus on the mobile business, simplify pricing bundles and enhance broadband-related products and WiFi is put into effect. That decrease began this quarter and will carry through future quarters, the said.CFO Jason Armstrong also said the division's average revenue per user, or ARPU, wasn't expected to grow as the company focuses on initiatives to maintain and grow its customer base. As broadband subscriber additions have slowed or reversed, Comcast has typically focused on the company's rising ARPU, which is driven by price increases and upselling packages.The change in broadband playbook means the bright spot that was once rising ARPU doesn't exist in the near term for Comcast.\"As we've said from the beginning, this pivot carries several costs, including rate reinvestment through pricing simplicity, which carries revenue dilution as well as investment in customer experience, which carries additional operating costs,\" Armstrong said on Thursday's call.This marked the first quarter in which those costs hit Comcast's results, Armstrong said. It translated to a 3.5% decline in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization across the company's connectivity and platforms business – made up broadband, mobile, pay TV and other services.Revenue for the company's overall connectivity and platforms business came in at $20.18 billion, down nearly 1% from the same period last year. \"On the other side of this, we're positioning ourselves for growth with a more durable broadband customer base,\" Armstrong said.The refocusing of the broadband strategy also aligned with a leadership change for the unit.On Thursday, Comcast announced Steve Croney would take over as CEO of the connectivity and platforms division, succeeding longtime leader Dave Watson. Croney has been serving as the chief operating officer of the group amid its new strategic push.While Comcast has moved toward mobile, that customer base has grown. Comcast said Thursday it added a record number of mobile customers – 414,000 during the third quarter, bringing its total to 8.9 million lines.Meanwhile, the exodus from the pay TV bundle continued, with Comcast reporting the segment lost 257,000 customers during the period. As of Sept. 30, Comcast had 11.5 million domestic pay TV customers. Shares of the company were down about 4% in early trading. In the last year, Comcast shares have fallen about 35%.Beyond broadbandComcast's overall business, which consists of the Xfinity-branded broadband, cable TV and mobile group as well as NBCUniversal, outperformed Wall Street's estimates. Here's how Comcast performed for the period compared with average analyst estimates, according to LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.12 adjusted vs. $1.10 expectedRevenue: $31.2 billion vs. $30.70 billion expectedFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income attributable to Comcast decreased 8% to $3.33 billion, or 90 cents per share, compared with $3.63 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, such as interest expense and the value of certain assets, Comcast reported earnings per share of $1.12 for the quarter. The company's adjusted EBITDA was down roughly 1% to $9.7 billion. Overall revenue fell nearly 3% to $31.2 billion, compared with $32.1 billion in the same period last year. Revenue for the company's media unit, which houses NBCUniversal, was $6.6 billion, down almost 20% during the period. Excluding the impact of the Summer Olympics, which took place during the same period last year, revenue was up 4% year over year. The media division reported EBITDA of $832 million, up 28% year over year, driven in part by streaming service Peacock. Peacock, which had 41 million subscribers as of Sept. 30 — essentially flat for the last three quarters — reported losses of $217 million for the quarter, an improvement from $436 million in losses during the same period last year. In October NBCUniversal's media rights deal with the NBA kicked off, bringing professional basketball back to broadcast network NBC and introducing it to Peacock. The addition of the NBA is expected to give Peacock a boost. Meanwhile, revenue for the film studio was up 6% to $3 billion – boosted by the release of \"Jurassic World Rebirth\" in July. Theme park revenue increased nearly 19% to $2.72 billion, with EBITDA for that unit up 13% to $958 million due to the opening of Epic Universe in May. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Drone view of damage to coastal homes after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Alligator Pond, Jamaica, Oct. 29, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersHurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall this week as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica. The strength of the storm means it will likely trigger a full payout from a catastrophe bond designed to provide funds to the island in the event of catastrophic weather events.The $150 million catastrophe bond, structured by Aon, is intended to help the island's people rebuild after natural disasters by providing Jamaica parametric coverage against losses from named storms. The policy took effect this year and lasts through 2027.The government of Jamaica is the first government in the Caribbean region, and the first of any small island state, to independently sponsor a cat bond, according to Aon. Its likely payout demonstrates the value of a unique type of backstop funded by the private markets.In order to trigger the full payment, the storm has to meet a particular strength criteria. The central pressure of the storm must be at or below 900 millibars as its makes landfall and crosses the island nation.A drone view shows an affected area after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Crane Road, Black River, Jamaica, October 30, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersEarly data from the National Hurricane Center shows Hurricane Melissa's pressure stayed below 900 millibars in several areas. Those readings are in the process of being verified by an independent calculation agent.\"While the final numbers are still being verified, the early signs suggest the transaction is doing what it was designed to do: getting critical funds to the country quickly after a major disaster,\" Chris Lefferdink, Aon's head of insurance-linked securities for North America, said in a statement.  The review process typically takes 2 to 3 weeks, and the earliest possible payout to Jamaica could come in approximately 1 month, according to a spokesperson from Aon.Previous parametric transactions payouts have taken 3 months or more, but for this event Aon used an innovative data source to enable faster payments.The catastrophe bond was placed using the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's \"capital at risk\" program, which is used to transfer the risks associated with natural catastrophes to the capital markets, allowing the country to access funds quickly after a major event.Damaged furniture and debris after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Black River, Jamaica, Oct. 30, 2025. Octavio Jones | Reuters\"What you have is a capital provider putting funds in the pool, an insurer putting the coupon for those funds in the pool [and] if the storm hits that criteria, they get the money in a much quicker fashion,\" Aon CFO Edmund Reese told CNBC's Contessa Brewer in an interview.Catastrophe bond and insurance-linked securities were created in the mid 1990s in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's destruction. They've since grown in popularity, with the cat bond market growing by over 50% since the end of 2022 to nearly $55 billion.\"Public-private partnerships like Jamaica's continue to highlight how parametric insurance can deliver rapid, transparent relief in the wake of severe storms,\" Lefferdink said.Jamaica very narrowly missed the requirements necessary to receive a payout from a separate cat bond when Hurricane Beryl battered the island in 2024, resulting in $995 million in damages to homes, crops and infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk. The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point. At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to no cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

But all of the rare earth has been settled, and that's for the world.\"Trump said he cut tariffs effective immediately on China related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%. This reduces the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%, the president told reporters. Trump had previously threatened the slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 over its rare earths controls.The U.S. will postpone a rule announced on Sept. 29 that blacklisted majority-owned subsidiaries of Chinese companies on an entity list, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Commerce. The U.S. and China also agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.Did China win?Beijing had surprised the White House with strict export controls on rare earths ahead of the meeting between Trump and Xi, exploiting its dominance of the global supply chain to gain leverage over Washington.The U.S. is dependent on China for rare earths, which are used to produce magnets that are key inputs in weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicles and other applications.China successfully used the rare earths export controls and a soybean embargo to force the U.S. to lower tariffs, Wolfe Research strategist Tobin Marcus told clients in a note.Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) alongside Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) Chairman Zheng Shanjie, and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao at Gimhae International Airport, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Busan, South Korea, October 30, 2025.

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersOpenAI will not be allowed use the word \"cameo\" to name any products or features in its Sora app for a month after a federal judge placed a temporary restraining order for the term on the AI startup.U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee granted a temporary restraining order on Monday, blocking OpenAI from using the \"cameo\" mark or similar words like \"Kameo\" or \"CameoVideo\" for any function related to Sora, the company's AI-generated video app.\"We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word 'cameo', and we look forward to continuing to make our case to the court,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC. Lee granted the order after OpenAI was sued in October by Cameo, a platform that allows users to purchase personalized videos from celebrities. Cameo filed a trademark lawsuit against the artificial intelligence company following the launch of Sora's \"Cameo\" feature, which allowed users to generate characters of themselves or others and insert them into videos.\"We are gratified by the court's decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,\" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. \"While the court's order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.\"The order is set to expire on Dec. 22, and a hearing for whether the halt should be made permanent is scheduled for Dec. 19. watch now",

The guides include top products, key differences between the products and the latest information from retailers, according to a blog. Users will be able to tailor their guides based on their budget, what features they care about and who they are shopping for. OpenAI said it will take a couple of minutes to generate answers with shopping research, so users who are looking for simple answers like a price check can still rely on a regular ChatGPT response.When users submit prompts to ChatGPT that say things like, \"Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" or \"I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art,\" they will see the shopping research tool pop up automatically, OpenAI said. The tool can also be accessed from the menu. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months. The company introduced a feature called Instant Checkout in September that allows users to make purchases directly from eligible merchants through ChatGPT. Shopping research users will be able to make purchases with Instant Checkout in the future, OpenAI said on Monday. OpenAI said its shopping research results are organic and based on publicly available retail websites, and that it will not share users' chats with retailers. It's possible that shopping research will make mistakes around product availability and pricing, the company said.Shopping research is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Go, Plus and Pro users who are logged in to ChatGPT.WATCH: OpenAI taps Foxconn to build AI hardware in the U.S.watch now",

Jim Justice holds up his dog Babydog as he comes to the end of his State of the State speech in the House chambers, at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, W.Va., Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022.Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette | APThe U.S. government on Monday sued Sen. Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican, and his wife for more than $5 million in unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest dating to the 2009 tax filing year.\"Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments ...James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States,\" the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, alleged.The lawsuit, filed by the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, asks a judge to enter a judgment in favor of the U.S. against the couple in the amount of $5,164,739.75, the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service as of Aug. 4, according to the filing.Hours after the suit was docketed, a lawyer for the Justices and the DOJ filed a joint motion asking a judge to enter a consent judgment in favor of the U.S. for the amount requested.The motion, which still requires a judge's approval, indicates that the couple agreed to resolve their case by being ordered to pay the amount requested. But it does not say when they would or could pay that money.The suit was filed nearly two months after the IRS filed notices of tax liens for more than $8 million against Justice, who is the former governor of West Virginia, in Greenbrier County.One of the notices referenced a federal income tax assessment of more than $3 million for the tax year 2009, which was assessed on Nov. 25, 2015 — the same date as the assessment referenced in the lawsuit filed Monday.The second federal income tax assessment, for nearly $5 million, was for the tax filing year 2017. A third such assessment, for the 2024 tax year, was for nearly $11,000./ Politico, which first broke the news of the tax lien on Oct. 10, noted then that the IRS website says \"generally the IRS can pursue collection of a tax liability up to 10 years from the date it was assessed. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed any time within that 10-year period.\"Tuesday is the end of a 10-year period that would have begun on Nov. 25, 2015.Justice was elected to the Senate in November 2024, replacing Sen.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump walks as workers react at U.S. Steel Corporation–Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, U.S., May 30, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has appointed two Department of Commerce officials to oversee U.S. Steel under the golden share agreement reached with Japan's Nippon, according to a letter posted Monday in the Federal Register. Trump approved U.S. Steel's controversial acquisition by Nippon in June after securing veto rights over key business decisions under a golden share arrangement. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange that same month after the acquisition was completed. Trump holds the veto powers covered by the golden share as U.S. president, but he can also designate someone else to wield those authorities as his representative if he wants. The president appointed William Kimmitt, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as his designee in a letter to U.S. Steel.\"I, President Donald J. Trump, hold the Class G Preferred Stock (Golden Share) in U.S. Steel, pursuant to the National Security Agreement (Agreement) between the United States Government, Nippon Steel Corporation, and U.S. Steel,\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 letter to U.S. Steel executive Scot Duncan.\"The Golden Share provides the President with the ability to oversee U.S. Steel's activities and to ensure the company continues operating its United States-based production facilities,\" Trump said. The golden share allows Trump or his designee to veto decisions that include changing U.S. Steel's name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh, relocating the company outside the U.S., or closing production facilities.  Trump also appointed David Shapiro, a chief counsel at Commerce, as a director on U.S. Steel's board representing the U.S. government, according to the letter. The golden share goes to future U.S. presidents or their designee after Trump leaves office. ",

    "body": "Japanese national flag flies before the National Emblem of China in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China.China Photos | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBack-to-back calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Japan and China have so far done little to defuse the diplomatic spat occurring between Beijing and Tokyo, as experts warn that a de-escalation of the crisis remains nowhere in sight.Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi spoke with Trump on Tuesday, hours after he held a separate call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Takaichi, in remarks to the media after her call with Trump, said that she discussed China relations during their conversation. The flurry of calls followed a dispute triggered by Takaichi's recent remarks over how Japan might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.Xi pressed Trump on Taiwan during their Monday call, urging Washington to help safeguard the international order post-World War Two, according to an official readout by China's foreign ministry.Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in a Truth Social post after his call with Xi, simply saying that they discussed the war in Ukraine, fentanyl and soybeans, among other things. The U.S. President also said that he will visit Beijing in April , with Xi set to make a state visit to the U.S. later in 2026.The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Xi had taken the unusual move of requesting for the call with Trump. Takaichi cannot retract her statement and Beijing knows that. Takaichi's sin was speaking with clarity for which Beijing is punishing her.David Boling and Jeremy ChanAnalysts at Eurasia GroupAndy Rothman, founder of China advisory firm Sinology, pointed out that the Chinese statement emphasized Taiwan, suggesting that Xi would like Trump to use his influence with Takaichi to persuade her to tone down her rhetoric on cross-Strait issues.Beijing has demanded that Takaichi retract her statement on Taiwan, but while the Japanese prime minister said she would avoid discussing specific scenarios in the future, she has not withdrawn her statement. \"Takaichi cannot retract her statement and Beijing knows that. Takaichi's sin was speaking with clarity for which Beijing is punishing her… As long as Takaichi remains prime minister, it's hard to see relations improving much,\" analysts David Boling and Jeremy Chan at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said.Alice Han, Director for China at advisory firm Greenvale, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that Xi \"prioritizes Taiwan as part of his legacy.\"On the other hand, Han said, the Trump administration is \"far more reluctant\" to sacrifice blood and treasure on the Taiwan question than his predecessors, preferring instead to focus on the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing. Washington's silence Beijing's outreach to Washington represents an unusual diplomatic opening for Washington as it seeks U.S. intervention to rein in tensions with Japan, seeing little benefit in further escalation, analysts said.However, Trump and the White House have stayed publicly silent.\"Trump's silence on the Sino-Japanese spat must be unnerving to both Taipei and Tokyo,\" said Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University. Beijing has sought to wield its economic influence against Tokyo, including restricting imports of Japanese seafood, advising its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan and urging those residing in the country to be extra vigilant. \"If Beijing were to escalate and start using military coercion, then you'd see a much stronger response from Washington,\" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the Japan-China summit on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Gyeongju on Oct. 31, 2025.Str | Afp | Getty ImagesBut even as Beijing's economic pressure on Tokyo builds, analysts say both sides have strong reasons to prevent the dispute from sliding into armed conflict.\"Both sides want to avoid a military clash, keeping the odds of an unintended conflict between China and Japan quite low,\" the Eurasia Group analysts said.However, they added that bilateral relations may not improve in the near term, citing past examples of Chinese economic coercion against South Korea and Australia, which took years to resolve.In 2017, South Korean products faced boycotts in China, group tours were banned, and a \"soft ban\" on K-pop content followed Seoul's deployment of the U.S.′ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system, also known as THAAD, on its soil the same year.A day after China issued a travel alert for Japan, the Takaichi cabinet dispatched a senior foreign ministry official to Beijing in an attempt to ease tensions, but the trip yielded no results.Beijing has made it clear that \"there's no room for compromise,\" Thompson said. \"We're probably going to be living with this crisis for a little bit longer.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t— CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report",

The shares later regained some ground to preliminarily close the session 5.8% lower.Analysts had prior to the results called the trial a long shot, whereas Novo itself had referred to it as a \"lottery ticket.\"\"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success,\" said Novo's chief scientific officer, Martin Holst Lange.A long shotThe trial results are a setback for Novo investors that had hoped that it might reignite the company's battered share price. Even before the Monday readout, Novo stock had halved year to date amid a series of guidance cuts and heighted competition, especially in the key U.S. market. \"While hopes were not high for a positive readout, potential success had perhaps kept some in the name, with this result removing a near-term upside scenario,\" wrote Jefferies analysts on Monday.Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is notoriously difficult to treat. It is also expected to affect an increasing proportion of people worldwide as populations grow older. Read moreCurrent treatments such as Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to a third, but come with the risk of severe side effects. Shares of Eli Lilly traded nearly 0.8% higher Monday at the closing bell in London, while Biogen stock rose 2.6%.Novo's decision to test Rybelsus, an oral form of semaglutide, had been largely based on real-world evidence suggesting a correlation between Alzheimer's and taking semaglutide.The drug works in a similar way to Lilly's rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 that naturally occurs in the body, to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance feelings of fullness. It's not yet clear how GLP-1s might benefit Alzheimer's patients, but the theory is that it targets the neuroinflammation thought to impact them.Top-line results will be presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference on Dec. 3, with full results at the 2026 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases Conference in March, Novo said.A competitive marketWhile shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged over the past 18 months, rival Eli Lilly only last week became the first pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.Even as Ozempic hit the market four years before Mounjaro, Novo's head start hasn't prevented Lilly from quickly grabbing a bigger market share in the U.S. This year, Novo has cut its guidance several times, blaming so-called compounders which sell copycat versions of semaglutide for a cheaper price. watch nowNovo recently replaced its chairman and half its board members over a disagreement between the former board and Novo's controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, about the scope and pace of change needed. It came just months after former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen was booted after an eight-year reign due to the stock decline.The former board was \"too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,\" new Chair Lars Rebien Sørensen said at the time.New CEO Mike Doustdar, who previously headed Novo's ex-U.S. operations, quickly set out to refocus the company's commercial priorities to its core obesity and diabetes businesses and to cut more than 10% of its global workforce.

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence.\"The Big Short\" investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he's built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. 'I doubted if I ever should come back. I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he contends history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesLONDON — European stocks are expected to open flat to lower on Tuesday as regional markets shrugged off Wall Street's rebound at the start of the week.The U.K.'s FTSE index is seen opening slightly lower, Germany's DAX down 0.2%, France's CAC 40 down 0.42% and Italy's FTSE MIB unchanged, according to data from IG.The dour open expected in Europe comes after major U.S. averages rebounded on Monday, driven by strength in the artificial intelligence trade and renewed hopes of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.  Asia-Pacific markets also traded higher overnight, boosted by Wall Street's rally.Traders continue to watch for any news that can affect the Fed's upcoming monetary policy decision. Markets are pricing in a more than 80% chance of a quarter percentage point cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability has risen since New York Fed President John Williams said last Friday that there was room to lower rates \"in the near term.\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that she supports lowering rates due to labor market concerns.In Europe on Tuesday, earnings come from Compass Group, Easyjet and Kingfisher while data releases include German GDP and French consumer confidence. In corporate news, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced Tuesday that it would cut 5,200 jobs by 2028 as it looks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The bank also said in the update ahead of its Capital Markets Day that it had agreed to sell its personal loans subsidiary Alfam to Rabobank.Elsewhere, regional defense stocks have been volatile over the past week as the U.S. continues its push for progress on a peace deal for Ukraine. On Monday, European Union leaders convened to discuss the 28-point peace plan that had initially been drafted by American and Russian officials, with no input from Ukraine or the rest of Europe. Under the preliminary draft, Ukraine would reportedly have had to make significant concessions to Russia — including giving away land occupied after the full-scale invasion, and downsizing its military — in order to end the war. In a statement following the meeting, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe held a central role in shaping Ukraine's future. \"These are our core European principles moving forward: Ukraine's territory and sovereignty must be respected,\" she said. \"Only Ukraine, as a sovereign country can make decisions regarding their armed forces, the choice of their destiny is in their own hands.\"She added that talks among the so-called Coalition of the Willing would continue on Tuesday. Investors in the U.K. are also gearing up for the Autumn Budget on Wednesday, with a raft of tax hikes expected to be announced by U.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves. — CNBC's Pia Singh contributed to this market report.",

But amid concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and President Donald Trump's latest wave of tariff hikes, shoppers may not be as eager to splurge this season.Consumers plan to spend an average of $622 between Nov. 27 and Dec. 1, down 4% from last year, according to a new Deloitte survey released Monday.

Overall, shoppers are trying to spread out their spending to be \"more strategic,\" according to Stephanie Carls, a retail insights expert at RetailMeNot. That also includes stacking savings, such as pairing sales events with promo codes or coupons as well as cash-back offers. \"They are using every tool that they can to protect those budgets,\" Carls said.watch nowDebt issues have been affecting a growing number of consumers across all income levels, several studies show. For many Americans, wage gains have largely not kept pace with stubborn inflation, which makes it harder to make ends meet in a typical month. Still, shoppers tend to rely on Thanksgiving week promotions for their gift buying: About 60% have already put items in their carts to purchase over the holiday shopping weekend, but 38% say they plan to only buy the items that are at least 50% off, Deloitte found.\"Value continues to be the centerpiece of the holiday season,\" Brian McCarthy, principal and retail strategy leader at Deloitte Consulting, said in a statement.Other reports also show a potential pullback this year. According to a recent LendingTree report, 64% of Americans plan to shop on Black Friday, but 39% said higher prices will lead them to spend less this year.One \"notable headwind,\" according to the National Retail Federation, was the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days. Americans were already facing mounting challenges in an increasingly bifurcated consumer economy. Income disruptions just ahead of the peak shopping season make budgeting particularly difficult, according to NRF's holiday sales forecast. A 'K'-shaped holiday seasonOverall economic growth in the U.S. has been good, but not all Americans have benefited, according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. In the so-called \"K\"-shaped economy, some consumers are in financial distress because their incomes have not kept pace with inflation over the last five years. \"That means their buying power has diminished as the overall price level of goods and services has risen noticeably,\" Wren wrote in a Nov. 12 research note.At the same time, consumers at the higher end of the income scale have strengthened their financial position, largely by benefiting from stock market rallies and appreciating home values. \"Their discretionary income continues to be strong and funds the purchases of cars, houses, vacations, and meals at restaurants,\" Wren wrote.Although, according to Deloitte's survey, even higher-income households plan to cut back during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday week.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "watch nowTesla sales in China dropped to a three-year low in October, raising concerns the electric vehicle maker could see its first full-year sales decline in the country this year. Fierce competition from local rivals such as NIO and Li Auto — both reporting this week — and a bruising price war in the face of a down economy pushed Tesla's China sales to 26,006 last month. The U.S. automaker's share in the Chinese EV market shrank to 3.2% in October from 8.7% in September. \"Tesla is getting surrounded by a swarm of Chinese automakers — from above, below, left and right,\" Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and auto analyst, told CNBC. \"Like a swarm of drones, each is taking some sales from the company with a target on its back.\"Tesla's newest direct competitor in the upper echelon of the Chinese EV market is Xiaomi. The smartphone maker's YU7 sports utility vehicle and SU7 sedan posted record sales in October despite accidents that raised concerns about the cars' safety.The auto newbie sold nearly 109,000 cars in the third quarter — compared with 170,000 for Tesla. Xiaomi's EV unit turned a profit for the first time.Late bloomer Leapmotor is pressuring Tesla, too. The Chinese EV startup was founded in 2015, but only this year started beating out its local peers in terms of sales and stock price. Analysts credit its in-house production for keeping costs down. Its C10 mid-sized SUV is priced at roughly half of a Model Y. Leapmotor also has a JV partnership with Europe's Stellantis.Leading EV sales in China this year is the Geely Geome Xingyuan. The hatchback is not a direct competitor to Tesla since it serves the cheaper end of the market with its sub $10,000 price tag. Yet it is an indication of where Chinese buyers are at — budget-conscious but looking for value.The Geome Xingyuan's success also highlights another trend — traditional automakers such as Geely making inroads in EVs. That trend is turning Huawei into a more notable Tesla rival. The Chinese tech giant partners with old-line carmakers like Seres, Chery, and Beijing Auto. The Aito M8, a Seres model, has become popular among high-end SUVs.Despite the steep competition, Tesla's Model Y is still holding up, ranking 6th in the overall market. At Tesla's annual general meeting this month, Musk said he expected the Chinese to approve the company's \"Full-Self Driving\" software in early 2026.Yet analysts say Tesla needs to refresh its models to keep pace with its local rivals.Tu Le, founder of consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights, sees 2026 as a \"pivotal year\" for Tesla in China.\"Reality is catching up to Tesla in China,\" Tu said. \"Tesla has done an admirable job via price cuts, non-price-cut price cuts and other tricks to maintain sales of almost five and four-year-old cars versus some of the world's most advanced EVs. But not keeping up with the Xiaomi's, BYD's and XPeng's seems to be finally starting to show itself in its monthly sales.\"Last month, Tesla reported its total third-quarter revenue increased 12% from a year earlier to $28.10 billion, following two straight periods of declines. Even with the overall revenue growth, Tesla's third quarter was marked by a continuing sales slump in Europe, driven partly by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD.",

Sandisk will replace marketing company Interpublic, which is being acquired by Omnicom, S&P Global said in a statement. It's the latest tech company to join the S&P 500, which gets an increasing amount of its value from internet, software and semiconductor businesses. AppLovin, Datadog, DoorDash and Robinhood became members of the index earlier this year.Stocks tend to rally when they're added to the benchmark as fund managers who track the S&P 500 need to buy shares to reflect the changes. Western Digital bought Sandisk in 2016 for $15.6 billion. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of about $33 billion.Sandisk sells fast storage drives for gaming PCs, digital cameras and security cameras, and is also trying to land deals with large-scale data center builders. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 23% to $2.31 billion. The company reported a 31% increase in exabytes sold.

    "body": "A Tesla logo outside the company's Tilburg Factory and Delivery Center.Karol Serewis | Getty ImagesTesla is trying to get its \"FSD Supervised\" technology approved for use in the Netherlands. But Dutch regulators are telling Tesla fans to stop pressuring safety authority RDW on the matter, and that their efforts will have \"no influence\" on the ultimate decision. The RDW issued a statement on Monday directed at those who have been sending messages to try and get the  agency to clear Tesla's premium partially automated driving system, marketed in the U.S. as the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) option. It's not yet available for use in the Netherlands or Europe broadly. \"We thank everyone who has already done so and would like to ask everyone not to contact us about this,\" the agency said. \"It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service. Moreover, this will have no influence on whether or not the planning is met. Road safety is the RDW's top priority: admission is only possible once the safety of the system has been convincingly demonstrated.\"The regulator said it will make a decision only after Elon Musk's company shows that the technology meets the country's stringent vehicle safety standards. The RDW has booked a schedule allowing Tesla to demonstrate its systems, and said it could decide on authorization as early as February. Last week, Tesla posted on X encouraging its followers to contact RDW to express their wishes to have the systems approved. The post claimed, \"RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026,\" adding a message to \"please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible.\" Tesla said other EU countries could then follow suit. The RDW corrected Tesla on Monday, saying in a statement on its official website, that such approval is not guaranteed and had not been promised. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Tesla's FSD-equipped vehicles in October following reports of widespread traffic violations tied to use of the systems.The cars Tesla sells today, even with FSD Supervised engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.For years, Musk has promised that Tesla customers would soon be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or supervisors on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed. Musk has said the company aims to remove human driers in Austin, Texas, by the end of 2025. WATCH: Tesla bear on company's EV businesswatch now",

    "body": "Luis Alvarez | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesAs December approaches, some older Americans must soon take required withdrawals from retirement accounts — and mistakes can be costly, according to financial experts. Starting at age 73, most retirees must start required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from pretax accounts, based on your balances, age and an IRS \"life expectancy factor.\" Your first RMD is due by April 1 of the year after turning 73, and Dec. 31 is the deadline for future withdrawals. Waiting until April 1 after turning 73 means you would need two RMDs that year.

The requirements can be difficult to follow amid changing legislation and IRS guidance, experts say.\"RMD mistakes rarely come from neglect. They come from complexity,\" said certified financial planner Scott Van Den Berg, president of advisory firm Century Management in Austin. \"People don't realize how many accounts they have, who's responsible for what or how quickly the rules have changed.\"If you don't take your full RMD by the due date, the penalty is 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn. But that can be reduced to 10% if the RMD is \"timely corrected\" within two years, according to the IRS. Here are some of the biggest RMD mistakes and how to avoid them.  One of the 'biggest mistakes' is waiting  While Dec. 31 is the RMD deadline for most retirees, many investors don't start the process soon enough, according to CFP Tom Geoghegan, founder of Beacon Hill Private Wealth in Summit, New Jersey.\"One of the biggest RMD mistakes is waiting until December to sort everything out,\" he said. \"When retirees rush, they are more likely to miscalculate the [RMD] amount, sell the wrong assets or miss the deadline altogether,\" he said. By starting early, there is more time to verify the year-end balance needed to calculate the RMD, confirm beneficiary details and pick the best way to pull cash from the portfolio, Geoghegan said.Missed accounts When calculating RMDs, you need to consider the requirements for each one and tally each RMD for your final number.  But one of the biggest mistakes is skipping accounts, such as an old 401(k), a forgotten rollover or an inherited individual retirement account from years ago, said Van Den Berg of Century Management.However, you can avoid this error by making a \"master list\" of your accounts every January, including which company holds the assets and the RMD requirements for each one, he said.  watch now'Underused' qualified charitable distributions If you donate money to charity, you can use so-called qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs, which are direct transfers from an IRA to an eligible nonprofit, to reduce RMDs. The move is \"underused\" and can satisfy your yearly RMD, according to Geoghegan of Beacon Hill Private Wealth.    Once you're age 70½ or older, you can use QCDs to donate up to $108,000 in 2025. For married couples filing jointly, spouses aged 70½ or older can also transfer up to $108,000 from their IRA.Another benefit of QCDs is the strategy will \"keep the income off the tax return, which helps with Medicare surcharges,\" Geoghegan said.

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on July 8, 2025. David A. Grogan | CNBCOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Friday that the artificial intelligence startup has finally finished its first prototypes for hardware devices.\"Finally, we have the first prototypes,\" Altman said in a video posted Monday by Emerson Collective, which invests in entrepreneurs. \"I can't believe how jaw dropping good the work is and how exciting it is.\"Altman was speaking in an on-stage discussion with former Apple design chief Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of the late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and president and founder of Emerson Collective. In May, OpenAI acquired Ive's startup, called io, for $6.4 billion in equity and announced that it would make new AI devices. Ive took on design responsibilities on the hardware project. Since then, OpenAI and io have been relatively quiet about the project. Ive said he expects to reveal the device in two years or less. He said that much of the development process for new hardware is unpredictable.\"Especially in large companies that value predictability, leaders get really uncomfortable with ambiguity,\" Ive said. Altman declined to answer a question about what exactly OpenAI is building, but said the company is targeting a calmer \"vibe\" with its hardware versus smartphones, which he compared to walking through Times Square.\"You can then go for a vibe that is not like walking through Times Square and getting bumped into and having all this stuff compete for your attention,\" Altman said. \"But, like, sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\"He said a smart AI device will be able to do things for the user over long periods of time, filter things out and understand when something is important enough to notify the user. Altman added that the device will be able to \"know everything you've ever thought about, read, said.\"OpenAI's hardware plans are being closely watched by rivals and potential customers alike. Companies including Amazon, Google, and Meta have released AI-oriented devices like smart glasses and speakers, but none has been a big enough hit to reshape the hardware industry. Startups are also experimenting with new device sizes like pendants and ideas like giving AI bots a personality. A major device launch from OpenAI, which has the most used chatbot with ChatGPT, could break the stalemate, and a successful product could eventually threaten Apple. The iPhone maker has yet to release an AI specific design, and the company has run into issues with rolling out improvements to Siri, its long-standing AI voice assistant. In March, Apple announced that it was delaying Siri improvements to 2026. Last week, OpenAI said it entered into an agreement with Foxconn, which manufactures many consumer electronics, including for Apple. However, the OpenAI deal with Foxconn is focused on building AI infrastructure, and the companies didn't mention device manufacturing.

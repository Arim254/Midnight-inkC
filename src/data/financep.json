    "body": "CSL employees.William West | AFP | Getty ImagesShares of Australian biotech firm CSL plunged to an 8-year low Wednesday after it announced the exit of Paul McKenzie as chief executive officer, and posted weak earnings for the first half of its fiscal year.Shares fell 17% to 151.3 Australian dollars, their lowest since February 2018.Senior executive Gordon Naylor, who has been with the company for 33 years, has been appointed as interim CEO, effective Wednesday, until a permanent replacement is found. CSL on Wednesday reported its net profit after tax plunged 81% year on year to $401 million for the six months ended December, as the drugmaker booked one-off restructuring costs and asset impairments. Revenue dropped 4% to $8.3 billion. The company said it was also impacted by government policy changes, but did not elaborate on that in its earnings release.\"We are clearly not satisfied with our performance and have implemented a number of initiatives to drive stronger growth going forward,\" said Ken Lim, CSL's chief financial officer.The company, one of the world's largest producers of flu vaccines, had a market cap of $58.9 billion as of Tuesday, data from LSEG showed. It highlighted that the seasonal influenza vaccine market in the U.S. was expected to fall by 6%-8% due to lower immunization rates.CSL said it expects results to improve in the second half of the year and kept its full-year outlook unchanged, forecasting modest growth in revenue and profit. The company also expanded its share buyback program by $250 million to $750 million. Headquartered in Australia, CSL operates globally, with major operations across the United States, Europe and Asia. Its stock fell about 39% last year.",

    "body": "Chinese consumers are experiencing \"luxury shame\" similar to what happened in the U.S. during the 2008-09 financial crisis, according to a June Bain and Company report.Jade Gao | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's consumer inflation rose less than expected in January while the deflation in producer prices persisted, in a sign of continued deflationary pressure in the absence of stronger stimulus.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, below economists' forecast of 0.4% increase in a Reuters poll. That followed a 0.8% growth in December, its highest level in nearly three years.  Prices rose 0.2% month-on-month, below economists' forecast of a 0.3% increase.China's producer price index declined 1.4% from a year ago, better than economists' expectations of a 1.5% drop, official data showed, moderating from a 1.9% drop in December. The deflation in factory-gate prices has persisted for more than three years, weighing on the profitability of manufacturers who have weathered tepid consumer confidence and production disruptions stemming from U.S. trade policies for much of last year. The world's second-largest economy grew 5% last year, in line with Beijing's official target, thanks to resilient export growth to non-U.S. markets. China has struggled to shake deflationary pressure since the end of the pandemic, weighed down by a prolonged property downturn and uncertain job-market prospects. Authorities have sought to curb price wars across industries, where overcapacity has fueled a glut of goods and forced companies to cut prices.Top policymakers are expected to unveil economic targets for the year at a parliamentary meeting next month.In a policy report on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China reiterated its determination to implement \"appropriately loose\" monetary policies to shore up the economy and guide prices towards \"a reasonable recovery.\" This is breaking news.

    "body": "A researcher works in the lab at the Moderna Inc. headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Food and Drug Administration has refused to start a review of Moderna's application for its experimental flu shot, the company announced Tuesday, in another sign of the Trump administration's influence on tightening vaccine regulations in the U.S. The company's stock fell roughly 7% in after-hours trading Tuesday.Moderna said the move is inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency from before it submitted the application and started phase three trials on the shot, called mRNA-1010. The drugmaker said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to \"understand the path forward.\" Moderna noted that the agency did not identify any specific safety or efficacy issues with the vaccine, but instead objected to the study design, despite previously approving it. The company added that the move won't impact its 2026 financial guidance.Moderna's jab showed positive phase three data last year, meeting all of the trial goals. At the time, Moderna said the stand-alone flu shot was key to its efforts to advance a combination vaccine targeting both influenza and Covid-19.The announcement follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Moderna on Tuesday specifically pointed to the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots. In a letter signed by Prasad on Feb. 3, he said the sole reason why the FDA refused to review the application was because of how the clinical trial on the shot was designed.The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot, arguing that it \"does not reflect the best-available standard of care.\" As a result, the FDA said the study did not meet its definition of an \"adequate and well-controlled\" trial.Moderna disputes that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. \"This decision by CBER, which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America's leadership in developing innovative medicines,\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a release. \"It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.\"Moderna said it expects the earliest approval for its flu shot to be in late 2026 or late 2027, pending regulatory reviews in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. The FDA said it does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.",

    "body": "2026 Ford Mustang Dark Horse SC on display during the Media Preview of the 2026 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place on February 6, 2026, in Chicago, Illinois.Jacek Boczarski | Anadolu | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Ford Motor reported its largest quarterly earnings miss in four years in its fourth-quarter results released Tuesday, while guiding for 2026 to be a rebound year for the automaker.Ford's 2026 guidance includes adjusted EBIT of between $8 billion and $10 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year; adjusted free cash flow of between $5 billion and $6 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2025; and capital expenditures of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion, up from $8.8 billion.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 13 cents adjusted vs. 19 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $41.83 billion expectedThe EPS coming in 32% below consensus was the company's first quarterly miss since 2024 and its worst since a 42% difference when reporting its 2021 fourth-quarter results, according to LSEG.The earnings miss was largely due to unexpected tariff costs of roughly $900 million related to credits for auto parts not taking effect as early as expected, the company said. Ford, as of Dec. 15, had confirmed $7.7 billion in earnings before interest and taxes for the fourth quarter, but the additional costs dropped that to $6.8 billion.Ford CFO Sherry House said the lower-than-expected earnings were also related to additional impacts from fires at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant last year in New York, which now isn't expected to be fully operational until the middle of this year. The plant supplies Ford's lucrative F-Series pickup trucks.\"We will see a billion-dollar benefit roughly in 2026; however, this year, due to the Novelis impact, we're going to have tariffs increasing in order to secure aluminum that is roughly the same amount of that savings,\" House told reporters.Ford's net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year at $2 billion in 2026, she said. The Novelis fire had an impact of $2 billion during the second half of the year for Ford, she added.House and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's 2025 results continue to demonstrate the company's underlying business is improving despite the special items impacting results.The company's 2025 revenue was a record $187.3 billion, up 1% from $185 billion a year earlier. That includes $45.9 billion during the fourth quarter, down 5% from a year before.On a business unit level, the automaker's traditional and fleet operations are expected to offset an expected $4 billion to $4.5 billion in losses this year for its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit. Pre-tax earnings from its \"Ford Pro\" fleet business are expected to be between $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, followed by $4 billion to $4.5 billion for its traditional \"Blue\" business.On an unadjusted basis, the company's net loss of $8.2 billion last year was its largest since the Great Recession in 2008, according to FactSet. That included $15.5 billion in special charges during the fourth quarter largely related to a pre-announced pullback in its all-electric vehicle plans.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion, or a loss of $2.77 per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the same period in 2024. Adjusted for the one-time charges, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share.",

    "body": "Gabriel Bouys | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Vatican Bank Tuesday launched two equity indexes tracking stocks that align with Catholic values. Its first foray into thematic investment products sets the bank up to potentially roll out other financial products, including ETFs in the future.  The bank, which reports to the Committee of Cardinals and the Pope, said Tuesday in a statement that the Morningstar IOR Eurozone Catholic Principles Index and the Morningstar IOR U.S. Catholic Principles Index include 50 medium and large-cap firms deemed to be consistent with Catholic ethical criteria, including prioritizing human bonds and social justice. \"Having benchmarks built in accordance with recognized Catholic ethical criteria allows us to make our performance assessment and reporting processes even more rigorous and transparent,\" Giovanni Boscia, Vatican Bank deputy director general and CFO, said in the statement. \"This initiative reaffirms our commitment as a financial institution serving the Church, further strengthening the role of the [Vatican Bank] as a reference point for the Catholic world.\"The Eurozone fund counts semiconductor supplier ASML Holding and telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom among its top holdings, while the US-based index's largest holdings include Meta Platforms and Amazon. Their rollouts also open up the possiblity the indexes could be licensed for use in an exchange traded fund.  The debut comes as investors' appetite for ETFs and other thematic investment products grows. The global ETF market increased nearly 30% to top $14 trillion in 2024, per PricewaterhouseCoopers. And, the combined value of those funds could hit as much as $30 trillion by 2029, according to a PwC report dated March 2025. Meanwhile, investment products rooted in social responsibility and other themes are appealing to certain slice of investors. The Ave Maria Mutual Funds, a fund family that allocates capital in accordance with Catholic teachings, said it had $3.8 billion in assets under management as of last year, per its website.  The Vatican Bank has been working to reform its image after a series of scandals. The Holy See-linked financial institution has faced several allegations of money laundering and ties with organized crime, particularly after the collapse of Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano in 1982. In 2021, former Vatican Bank president Angelo Caloia was found guilty of money laundering and embezzling millions of euros in connection with his role at the institution. ",

    "body": "Walmart Inc. signage during the company's listing at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEstée Lauder sued Walmart in California federal court over allegations the big-box retailer sold counterfeit beauty products on its website and didn't do enough to ensure only authorized and authentic merchandise was offered to consumers. Estée Lauder said it purchased, inspected or tested a number of products sold on Walmart.com that used  the Le Labo, La Mer, Clinique, Aveda, Tom Ford and Estée Lauder trademarks but were determined to be fakes, according to the suit, filed Monday. The products include counterfeit versions of Estée Lauder's Advanced Night Repair serum, a Le Labo fragrance, a Clinique eye cream, a La Mer lotion, an Aveda hair brush and a Tom Ford fragrance. xemplars of the Estée Lauder Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintIt's unclear when Estée Lauder bought and tested the products but the suit comes several months after CNBC published an investigation into counterfeit beauty products and fraud on Walmart.com. Two of the counterfeit products cited in CNBC's investigation — Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum and Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream — were also mentioned in Estée Lauder's lawsuit. It's unclear if the products cited in the suit are the same counterfeits CNBC provided to Estée Lauder. In response, Walmart initially told CNBC in a statement it requires \"all sellers to offer only authentic, lawful merchandise\" and it doesn't tolerate \"bad actors\" on its platform. It then recalled the message and sent an abbreviated statement to CNBC two hours later that removed that language. \"We are aware of the complaint and have zero tolerance for counterfeit products,\" the revised statement read. \"We will respond appropriately with the court when we are served.\" Estée Lauder didn't return a request for comment. Exemplars of the Clinique Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintWhile the products were sold by third-party sellers on Walmart's online marketplace, Estée Lauder said the company played an active role in facilitating those sales to shoppers in its suit. The legacy beauty company called Walmart's conduct \"extreme, outrageous, fraudulent … despicable and harmful.\" The counterfeit products were promoted and advertised to shoppers on the platform, Estee Lauder's trademarks were used in search engine optimization tools to drive traffic to the listings and Walmart profited from the sales, the complaint stated. Further, \"a person shopping on Walmart.com would have reasonably believed that Walmart, and not third-party sellers, was the seller\" of the item, which could have caused confusion among shoppers, the complaint states. At the heart of CNBC's investigation into Walmart's online marketplace was the steps the company took, or didn't take, to vet its third-party sellers and the products they were offering to prevent fraud and the sale of fakes on the platform. Exemplars of the La Mer Accused Products.U.S. District Court ComplaintIn its complaint, Estée Lauder said Walmart promoted the \"reputation and professionalism\" of the sellers permitted to operate on the platform but said the retailer actually does \"very little to ensure that only authorized and authentic products are available\" for sale. \"This is readily apparent given the [counterfeits] were permitted to be sold on Defendants' website despite their stated careful selection process in who they choose as a Marketplace seller/partner,\" the complaint states. \"Accordingly, Defendants know or had reason to know that the sellers they partnered with and 'regularly review[ed]' were selling products which infringe upon the Estée Lauder Marks.\" Walmart's online marketplace has become a key part of its strategy to grow profit faster than sales and better compete against its longtime rival, Amazon. The rapid growth of the online platform helped fuel Walmart's ascent to a $1 trillion market cap last week, putting it in an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. However, the strategy has come with risks, CNBC's investigation revealed. Offering counterfeit, potentially dangerous, products to shoppers through third-party sellers on the marketplace opens Walmart up to liability and could erode the customer trust at the core of its brand. Exemplars of the Le Labo Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintEver since a 2010 court ruling that arose after Tiffany sued eBay over counterfeit products on the platform, it can be tough for brands to hold platforms accountable for their role in selling counterfeit goods. Sometimes, they avoid lawsuits unless the conduct is extreme or particularly flagrant, experts previously told CNBC.The Shop Safe Act, a bipartisan federal bill that aims to curb the sale of fakes on online marketplaces, is designed to address some of the issues posed by the Tiffany v. eBay ruling by incentivizing platforms to better vet sellers and the products they're offering. When platforms comply with certain anti-counterfeiting measures, they could be shielded from liability if a seller offers a fake product. Brands widely supported the legislation, but it has so far failed to pass at least three times. That's partially because Walmart and other online marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy and eBay have lobbied against aspects of it, two U.S. Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private, previously told CNBC. ",

    "body": "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks with reporters as the House votes to end the partial government shutdown on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026.Kylie Cooper | ReutersHouse Republican leaders are in danger of an embarrassing loss on a procedural vote Tuesday because fellow GOP lawmakers are balking at voting to block challenges to President Donald Trump's tariffs through the summer.A potential GOP rebellion on the vote highlights divisions among House Republicans, a dynamic that could make it even harder for Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to advance his and Trump's agenda through a narrowly divided Congress. Dissatisfied factions within the House GOP have revolted several times this Congress, forcing the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and supporting a failed Democratic effort to extend Obamacare subsidies.Johnson cannot afford to lose more than one Republican, assuming all members are present and Democrats are united against the measure being voted on that would set the rules for debating a bill to boost domestic production of critical minerals. At least two Republicans said they plan to vote against Johnson.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a perennial thorn in the side of GOP leadership, has vowed to vote \"no.\" Others have similarly signaled their opposition, as frustration over Trump's tariffs and leadership's maneuvering percolates within the Republican ranks.Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday he objects to \"this idea that everyone needs to stick together to bring a particular bill on the floor\" because it makes the House \"less of a democratic body.\" The vote was originally slated for early afternoon, but House Republicans rescheduled it for Tuesday night.Johnson on Tuesday said he expects the measure to pass and said the rationale for the vote this week is \"to allow the Supreme Court to rule on the pending case.\" The Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge to Trump's tariffs with a ruling pending following oral arguments last November.\"That process has been playing out. I think it's logical to allow that to continue. The president's trade policies have been a great benefit to the country,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The House Rules Committee on Monday approved language that would block any House votes disapproving of Trump's tariffs through July 31. House Democrats had already planned to force a vote on tariffs this week.\"It is no secret that in private many Republican members of Congress have concerns with President Trump's tariff policies. Now some are even voicing their concerns in public,\" the House Rules Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said at Monday's hearing.\"They were just about to have the chance to vote this week to end them. So what's this all about? The White House is scared. They know that the Republican House finally, after months of blocking itself from doing what the Senate has already done, is poised to vote to end these unpopular, unwise, downright dumb tariffs,\" McGovern continued.The Senate has on multiple occasions voted to strike down tariffs issued by Trump, while the House has blocked votes on tariff-related resolutions. The latest prohibition on tariff votes expired at the end of January.For Tuesday's vote, some other Republicans expressed their discomfort with tariffs, but did not commit to opposing the measure up for a vote.\"The Supreme Court is going to be deciding this issue by June. So there is an argument to be made to maintain the status quo until then,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"I believe in free trade. And tariffs are a big mistake. But given that the Supreme Court's about to weigh in, maybe we ought to just keep our powder dry and see what they say.\"— CNBC's Karen Sloan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowConsumer activity slowed sharply for the December holiday shopping season amid a spate of rough weather, tariff impact and persistently higher inflation, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.Retail sales were flat on the month following a 0.6% increase in November, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales also were unchanged, against the estimate for a 0.3% increase.On an annual basis, sales rose 2.4%, a considerable step down from the 3.3% pace in November. Sales ex-autos were up 3.3% annually in December. A measure known as the \"control group\" of sales that excludes a number of items and feeds directly into gross domestic product calculations showed a 0.1% drop for the month.The report puts a downbeat end to an otherwise solid year for shopping activity, with higher-end consumers spending briskly through much of 2025, though those on the lower end of the income spectrum were more cautious.The shopping pace failed to keep up with inflation, as the consumer price index for December posted a 2.7% increase.For December, multiple categories posted losses while only a few showed notable gains.watch nowMiscellaneous retailers and furniture stores posted declines of 0.9%, while clothing and accessories stores were off 0.7%, and electronics and appliances saw a drop of 0.4%. Online outlets sales rose just 0.1%, while building materials and garden centers saw the strongest gain, up 1.2%.\"This is a K-shaped economy with strong spending from the top and much more cautious spending from middle- and lower-income consumers,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Retail sales were flat in December, driven by soft spending on autos, home furnishings, appliances and clothing. These items were hard hit by tariffs in 2025 and consumers shifted their spending elsewhere.\"Fourth-quarter economic activity otherwise was strong, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's data tracker pointing to GDP rising at a 4.2% annualized pace. However, that number could be lowered Tuesday following the retail number. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S.The report comes a day ahead of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls count for January. Economists expect that to show an increase of just 55,000, following the 50,000 gain in December. However, several prominent Wall Street firms say they are looking for a lower number, with annual revisions due out that also are expected to shrink previous payroll growth.In other economic news Tuesday, the employment cost index posted a seasonally adjusted 0.7% increase for the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, below the 0.8% forecast. For the year, total compensation costs rose 3.4%, or a bit above the inflation rate. The quarterly rate was the slowest gain since Q3 of 2020.The BLS also reported that import prices rose 0.1% in December, against a forecast decrease of 0.1%, and were unchanged from a year ago. Export prices increased 0.3% and were up 3.1% annually.",

We were on family vacation,\" he said.The secretary's admission came as he faces bipartisan calls to resign following the release of records showing that his business and personal relationship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on February 10, 2026 in Washington, DC. Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after revelations that came to light in the latest release of Epstein files. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLutnick previously said that he cut off contact with Epstein after 2005 — years before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state-level charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender.But analyses of the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice show Lutnick and Epstein were in communication years later.In December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to lunch on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the documents showed. The two men also had business dealings as recently as 2014, CBS News reported.Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.The White House expressed confidence in Lutnick Monday after multiple lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, demanded his ouster.Following Lutnick's testimony Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a White House briefing that President Donald Trump continues to stand behind his Commerce chief.In his testimony Tuesday morning before the Appropriations panel's subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, Lutnick insisted that he \"barely had anything to do with that person.\"\"I'm glad to be here to make it clear that I met Jeffrey Epstein when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York,\" the Cabinet secretary testified.\"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times,\" Lutnick said. \"So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.\"\"Probably the total — and you've seen all of these documents, of these millions and millions of documents — there may be 10 emails connecting me with him. ... Over a 14-year period.\"\"I did not have any relationship with him,\" Lutnick said.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the subcommittee's ranking member, replied, \"There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you ... misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements suggesting that you cut off all contact, when, in fact, you had not.\"Asked by Van Hollen if he saw anything inappropriate during his visit to the island, Lutnick said that he did not.\"The only thing I saw with my wife and my children and the other couple and their children was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island,\" he testified.Van Hollen asked if Lutnick would commit to sharing with Congress his own records relating to Epstein in order to \"ensure that the file is complete.\"\"I will surely talk about that. Hadn't thought about that,\" Lutnick said, adding, \"I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing.\"",

    "body": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA referral by former Trump campaign lawyer Kurt Olsen led to the recent FBI raid that seized 2020 election ballots from a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center, a newly unsealed federal court document revealed Tuesday.The document, an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, said that the FBI is conducting a \"criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties\" alleged to have occurred in voting processes and ballot counting in Fulton County in 2020 \"were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws.\"\"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity,\" the affidavit document in U.S. District Court in Atlanta says.Olsen worked on efforts after the 2020 election to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in that contest to former President Joe Biden.Evans' affidavit was submitted by federal prosecutors as part of an application asking a federal magistrate judge to sign a search warrant for the election center. Olsen reportedly was hired last fall to investigate election issues.The affidavit was ordered unsealed by Atlanta federal court Judge J.P. Boulee, who was nominated by Trump, after the chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and county Board of Registration and Elections sued the federal government over the seizure of the ballots and sought their return.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the election center on Jan. 28 when FBI agents raided the site and seized ballots.Gabbard's presence and the raid itself have been strongly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others concerned that President Donald Trump is undercutting confidence in the upcoming midterm elections while resurrecting long-discredited claims that he actually won the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Gabbard has said was at the election center at the direction of Trump. The president, in turn, has said that Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.On Tuesday, two Democratic senators, Alex Padilla of California and Virginia's Mark Warner, called on Gabbard to immediately schedule an intelligence community briefing for senators on election security concerns ahead of the midterm elections.\"The request comes amid unprecedented investigations by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), purportedly to address 'evidence' of election vulnerabilities and manipulation of election results, which have not been substantiated,\" the senators' offices said in a statement.The warrant signed by the magistrate judge in Georgia authorized the FBI to seize all physical ballots from the 2020 general election in Fulton County, including absentee ballots; tabulator tapes for every voting machine; and the vote rolls from the county.The affidavit signed by Evans, the FBI agent, says, \"Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia.\"\"Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County,\" Evans wrote.The agent said the investigation is focused on several \"deficiencies or defects with the\" 2020 election and tabulation of votes.\"The tabulator machines used by Fulton County are designed to create and save a scanned image of each ballot,\" Evans wrote. \"Fulton County has admitted that it does not have scanned images of all the 528,777 ballots counted during the Original Count or the 527,925 ballots counted during the Recount.\"\"Fulton County has confirmed that during the Recount of votes, some ballots were scanned multiple times,\" the agent wrote. \"Ballot images made available in response to public record requests show ballots with unique markings duplicated within the ballot images.\"Evans also said that auditors who counted votes by hand reported vote tallies that were inconsistent with the actual number of votes within a batch, and that Fulton County reported two different vote tallies on the deadline to report recount results and on the subsequent day.\"If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race,\" the affidavit said.",

Rides totaled 243.5 million, versus a FactSet estimate of 256.6 million.The company's board also approved up to $1 billion in additional share buybacks.Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance said Tuesday it has sweetened its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, adding a so-called ticking fee to signal regulatory confidence among other new elements. Paramount stopped short, however, of raising its per-share offer to WBD shareholders. In December, Paramount launched a hostile tender offer for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery at $30 per share, all cash. The company contends its offer is superior to a pending transaction between Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix. \"The additional benefits of our superior $30 per share, all-cash offer clearly underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value WBD shareholders deserve for their investment,\" said Paramount CEO David Ellison in a statement. \"We are making meaningful enhancements – backing this offer with billions of dollars, providing shareholders with certainty in value, a clear regulatory path, and protection against market volatility.\"The \"ticking fee\" is payable to WBD shareholders for any potential delays in receiving regulatory approval for a Paramount-WBD tie-up. Paramount has set the fee at 25 cents per share, per quarter that the transaction hasn't closed after year-end 2026, \"underscoring Paramount's confidence in the speed and certainty of regulatory approval for its transaction,\" the company said. The so-called ticking fee is equivalent to roughly $650 million in cash value each quarter for every quarter the deal is not closed past Dec. 31. In addition, on Tuesday Paramount said it would fund the $2.8 billion termination fee that Warner Bros. Discovery would owe Netflix if that deal were to fall through, and it would also eliminate a potential $1.5 billion refinancing cost of debt. Paramount said the revised offer — including the ticking fee, funding the termination fee and refinancing — is \"fully financed\" by $43.6 billion of equity commitments from the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners, as well as $54 billion in debt commitments from lenders Bank of America, Citigroup and private equity firm Apollo. WBD, in a statement on Tuesday, confirmed receipt of the amended offer and said the board would review and consider it. The board has so far consistently recommended WBD shareholders reject Paramount's offer. Paramount has sued WBD seeking more information about the sale process and its valuation, and said it intends to nominate directors to the WBD board.watch nowRedBird Capital Partners' Gerry Cardinale told CNBC's David Faber on Tuesday that the amended bid was an effort to \"continue to reinforce and perfect\" Paramount's offer.\"What we've done is we've perfected it by taking off the table all of the, what I call, more clerical items that they have been using to suggest that they are not going to engage with us,\" said Cardinale, the firm's founder.If WBD still declines the offer, Cardinale said RedBird and Paramount will continue going directly to shareholders to make their case, though he said he believes there is no reason for the board to not engage.\"Our deal is highly aligned with delivering the best value and certainty – that has never changed,\" he said.Netflix's proposed acquisition of WBD's streaming and studios assets was estimated to close in 12 to 18 months from when the deal was announced in December. That deal would close after the separation of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN, TBS and Discovery, takes place, which is expected in the third quarter of 2026. Last month, Netflix amended its own offer for WBD assets to pay $27.75 per share entirely in cash. The initial deal was composed of a combination of cash and stock at an equity value of $72 billion. Paramount's revised offer leans on antitrust concerns that have been raised by lawmakers and industry insiders since Netflix announced the proposed deal.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has publicly noted his confidence in getting the deal approved, most recently in the company's January earnings call with investors. Sarandos said he believed the deal would secure regulatory approval, contending it would preserve jobs at a time of heavy layoffs across media \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"— CNBC's Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesAstera Labs reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on top and bottom lines, but shares plunged as much as 10% as revenue came short of some analysts' expectations. Here's how the artificial intelligence infrastructure and semiconductor company did compared to LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $271 million vs. $250 million expectedRevenue in the fourth quarter rose 92% year over year. However, some analysts were expecting the company to report revenue in excess of $280 million for the period.Astera Labs reported $45 million in net income for the quarter, an 82% increase from $24.7 million the year before. The company said it expects first-quarter revenue to come between $286 million and $297 million, higher than Wall Street expectations of $259 million.\"We started the company eight years ago to really service the cloud and AI infrastructure space,\" Astera Labs CEO Jitendra Mohan told CNBC on Tuesday. \"And fortunately for us, the space is on fire.\"Mohan attributed the earnings beat to growth in its Scorpio fabric switch and its Taurus ethernet cables, which accounted for 30% of total revenue collectively.\"Increasingly, the bottleneck is shifting from compute to connectivity, and connectivity is where we play,\" Mohan said. \"So it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to grow and beat the overall market growth rate in the AI space.\"In addition to reporting earnings, the company also announced that finance chief Mike Tate will be stepping down. Desmond Lynch, currently the finance chief at semiconductor company Rambus, will replace Tate, effective March 2. Tate will remain at Astera Labs as a strategic advisor to the CEO.Additionally, Astera Labs on Tuesday said it had issued a new warrant for Amazon to buy about $466 million in the chip company's stock. Amazon owned $43 million in Astera Labs shares as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.Astera Labs also announced a research and development center in Israel on Monday.\"We are really bottlenecked by the availability of resources more than anything else,\" Mohan said. \"So opening a design center in Israel is one step towards getting access to the talent pool that is available.\"Astera Labs was founded by former Texas Instruments executives in 2017. The company went public in 2024, and has inked deals with Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Amazon as customers of its chips.-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this reportWATCH: AI is still in the early stages of development, says Astera Labs CEO watch now",

    "body": "Gen Z may have a reputation for delaying adulthood milestones like moving out on their own, getting married and having kids, but saving for retirement is one area where the youngest working adults may be outperforming their elders.Gen Z is the generation most likely to be on track to retire successfully, with 47% of workers aged 24 to 28 currently poised to have enough money to maintain their current lifestyle in retirement, according to a recent study by investment management firm Vanguard.In total, 42% of all U.S. adults are on track to have enough retirement savings, Vanguard finds. Generationally, millennials come closest to Gen Z's preparation with 42% of those aged 29 to 44 on track, followed by 41% of Gen Xers (aged 45 to 60) and 40% of baby boomers (aged 61 to 65).Vanguard examined data from the Federal Reserve's 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances for over 2,200 U.S. households to estimate the percentage of each generation on track for a successful retirement, defined as having enough money — in most market or longevity scenarios — to maintain their pre-retirement lifestyle throughout retirement. The study focused on \"younger baby boomers, Gen X, millennials, older Gen Z individuals\" since those cohorts are most likely to be part of the \"working population.\"Though youth may seem like the obvious advantage Gen Z has over older generations, it's not the only reason so many of them are pacing well to retire comfortably.Automatic enrollment and time on Gen Z's sidePart of the reason Gen Z is able to prepare for retirement so early in their careers is due to the rise of employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) and 403(b) accounts, and auto-enrollment in such plans, Vanguard says.While some boomers have had the benefit of 401(k) plans or pension funds for much of their careers, Gen Z has benefitted from the proliferation of knowledge around retirement savings and the growing trend of employers automatically enrolling workers into savings plans, says Kelly Hahn, Vanguard investment strategist and co-author of the research paper.\"[Gen Zers are] automatically enrolled in their retirement plans, and oftentimes the savings rates are set for them, and it escalates with time,\" she says. \"There's a macro factor of the system improving that's sort of giving them the tailwind.\"Plus, Gen Z has the benefit of time. While working baby boomers, which Vanguard defines as those aged 61 to 65, may not be able or willing to continue working beyond age 65 in order to meet their retirement goals, Gen Z has decades to let their investments grow and adjust their strategies.\"Gen Z [has] the benefit of the next 40 years of working,\" Hahn says. \"If we were to assume that people continue to save into the [defined contribution] programs, as well as saving at a higher rate than we have seen with the older generations, then that only propels the retirement readiness number for younger generations.\"Even members of Gen Z who aren't on track for retirement are still better positioned than their older peers, Vanguard reports. A Gen Z worker earning the median income for their generation of $27,000 a year can expect to face a gap of around $3,000 per year to be able to retire comfortably, the study found, compared with a $9,000 gap for a boomer earning their generation's median of $56,000 a year. Smooth sailing isn't definiteHowever, Gen Z may also face a number of challenges when it comes to saving for retirement.Student debt is one major factor that could impede Gen Z's retirement if they don't stay on top of their balances, Hahn says. Though student debt impacts workers from every generation, Gen Z makes up 28% of all student loan borrowers, according to Education Data Initiative. Millennials make up the largest share at 40% of the student debtor population.\"We need people to think about their finances holistically, not just in one silo, one sliver of the overall balance sheet, like retirement savings,\" Hahn says. \"We want people to think about debt management as well as building emergency savings.\"Additionally, with so much time left in their careers, it's likely many Gen Zers will change jobs at least a couple of times before retirement. They \"need to be cognizant of these switch points,\" Hahn says, because often when workers change jobs, they don't continue contributing to their retirement plan at the same rate at their new job.\"We want people to have a balanced approach of thinking about saving, but also debt management, in order to have a strong financial position going into retirement,\" Hahn says. \"I think Gen Zers have a tremendous opportunity to implement that, to not be in the position that certain older generations might have gotten themselves into.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Four men have been indicted on federal criminal charges related to a plot to export Nvidia chips worth millions of dollars to China and Hong Kong in violation of tight U.S. restrictions, court documents show.The chips are highly restricted from exports because of their use in artificial intelligence and supercomputing applications, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida.One of the defendants, Brian Curtis Raymond, a 46-year-old resident of Huntsville, Alabama, was identified last week as the chief technology officer of an artificial intelligence cloud company in Virginia that announced plans for a merger that would allow its stock to be publicly traded. That company is not implicated in the case, and told CNBC that his job offer has been rescinded.Raymond and the other three defendants, all of whom were born in China or Hong Kong, are charged with conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 in connection with the export and attempted export of the Nvidia chips to end users in China and Hong Kong, after first shipping the chips to Malaysia and Thailand. The defendants had not obtained a license or authorization for such exports from the Commerce Department, according to the indictment.The indictment was first reported by CourtWatch, the court document aggregation news site founded by counterrorism researcher Seamus Hughes.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, which is prosecuting the case, said that 400 Nvidia A100 chips were exported to China as part of the scheme from October 2024 and January in two separate shipments. \"The third and fourth exports to [China] were disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed,\" the office said. \"These attempted exports related to ten Hewlett Packard Enterprises supercomputers containing NVIDIA H100 GPUs and 50 separate NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\"The indictment notes that China \"is rapidly developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and has announced its intent to be the world leader in AI by 2030.\"\"These capabilities are being used by the PRC [People's Republic of China] for its military modernization efforts and in connection with the PRC's weapons design and testing, including for weapons or mass destruction,\" the indictment says.Raymond owned a technology products distributor company in Huntsville, which was \"licensed to sell Nvidia GPUs [graphics processing units], among other products,\" the indictment says. Raymond's LinkedIn page says his company, Bitworks, is or was a \"Nvidia Cloud Partner delivering H100, H200, and coming Blackwell / NVL72 clusters for customers.\"Raymond and another co-defendant in the case, Mathew Ho, would \"cause freight forwarded to chip Nvidia GPUs to third countries, knowing that the GPUs were ultimately destined for and would be transhipped to the\" People's Republic of China,  the indictment alleges. Ho, a 34-year-old who was born in Hong Kong, is a U.S. citizen who lives in Florida. He is also known as Hon Ning Ho.Ho was the registered agent of a company in Tampa called Janford Realtor, which, despite its name, was never involved in any real estate transactions, but instead \"served as an intermediary for several unlawful and unlicensed exports to\" China of the advanced and highly-controlled chips, the indictment says.As part of the alleged conspiracy, Ho and Raymond would submit documents related to the shipments that contained false information about the ultimate cosignors for the chips, the value of the chips and the licenses required for their export, the indictment says.Raymond was arrested on Wednesday and later appeared in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. His wife declined to comment.Raymond's lawyer, Tae Lee, declined to comment on the charges.On Nov. 10, three days before the indictment was filed in Tampa, Raymond was identified in a press release issued by Corvex, an Arlington, Virginia-based AI cloud company, as its chief technology officer.The press release said Corvex and Movano Health, a publicly traded company that sells medical wearables, had agreed to a merger that would enable Corvex to become publicly traded. A Corvex spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC after being asked about Raymond, said, \"Corvex had no part in the activities cited in the Department of Justice's indictment.\"\"The person in question is not an employee of Corvex. Previously a consultant to the company, he was transitioning into an employee role but that offer has been rescinded,\" the spokesperson saidIn addition to the top count of conspiracy, Raymond is charged with two counts of violations of the Export Control Reform Act in connection with an attempt to export 50 Nvidia H200 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year, and the attempted export of about 10 HP supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year. He is also charged with one count of smuggling goods from the United States related to the attempted export of the 50 Nvidia H200 chips.Raymond is also charged with seven counts of money laundering related to wire transfers totaling more than $3.4 million from a bank account for a company in China to a bank account belonging to Raymond's company in Huntsville, and to Janford Realtor.Ho and the two other defendants in the case, Jing Chen and Cham Li, were all arrested in recent days, according to court documents.Those three men, as part of the alleged conspiracy, would identify customers in China who wanted to buy the Nvidia chips, the indictment says.Ho and Chen, a 45-year-old also known as Harry Chen, were arrested in Tampa. They are being held without bail. In addition to the conspiracy count, Ho is charged with nine money laundering counts in connection with $4 million in wire transfers from the bank account for the Chinese company to Janford Realtor and to Raymond's company. He is also charged with four counts of violating the Export Control Reform Act, and three counts of smuggling.Ho's lawyer, Samuel Williams, declined to comment on the case.Chen is a Chinese national who entered the U.S. on a student visa and who resides in Tampa.He is charged with conspiracy, one count of violating the ECRA, and one count of smuggling.Information about Chen's lawyer was not publicly available.Li, a 38-year-old also known as Tony Li, was arrested in California and was due to appear in Oakland federal court on Thursday. Information about Li's lawyer was not available. A Chinese national who lives in California, Li was identified as a manager of Janford Realtor, according to the indictment.He is charged with a single count each of conspiracy, violating the ECRA and smuggling.All four defendants face a possible maximum sentence if convicted of 20 years in prison.— CNBC's Samantha Subin contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Oil drilling rigs and support equipment stand on the tundra in Deadhorse, Alaska, on Friday, Sept. 5, 2025. Nathaniel Wilder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration unveiled plans Thursday for a huge oil drilling expansion off the coasts of Alaska, California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior proposed 34 lease sales to drill in those waters through 2031, a big expansion compared to the Biden administration program that allowed just three lease sales and only in the Gulf. The Trump program would include lease sales in 21 areas off Alaska's coast, six off the Pacific coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico. It would mark the first time since 1984 that Interior has allowed a new lease in the Pacific, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Interior's proposal is not a final program. It still must undergo further review. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accused the Biden administration \"crippling the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production\" by slamming the brakes on oil and gas leasing. More than 100 Democratic lawmakers expressed their opposition to the plan in an Oct. 30 letter addressed to President Donald Trump and Burgum. \"Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Natural Resources Defense Council condemned the Trump plan as egregious and reckless in a post Thursday. \"The proposal would open up untouched waters of Alaska to drilling, attempt to resurrect the offshore oil and gas industry in California, and offer up waters off the coast of Florida that haven't been put up for leasing in decades — in addition to adding even more leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the NRDC said. \"This plan would damage these places, and the people who rely on them, for generations,\" the environmental group said.

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesIn November 2022, Beth Pinsker's 76-year-old mother began to get sick.Ann Pinsker, an otherwise healthy woman, had elected to have a spinal surgery to preserve her ability to walk after having back issues. What Ann and Beth had thought would be a straightforward recovery process instead yielded complications and infections, landing Ann in one assisted living facility after another as her daughter navigated her care.Eventually, by July of the following year, Ann died.\"We thought she'd be back up to speed a few weeks after hospital stay, rehab, home, but she had complications, and it was all a lot harder than she thought,\" Beth Pinsker, a certified financial planner and financial planning columnist at MarketWatch who has written a book on caregiving, told CNBC.It wasn't Pinsker's first time navigating senior care. Five years before her mother's death, she took care of her father, and before that, her grandparents.But throughout each of those processes, Pinsker said she noticed a significant shift in the senior caregiving sector.\"From the level of care that my grandparents received to the level of care that my mom received, prices skyrocketed and services decreased,\" she said.It's evocative of a larger trend across the sector as the senior population in the U.S. booms and the labor force struggles to keep up.Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau found that the population of people ages 65 and older in the country grew from 12.4% in 2004 to 18% in 2024, and the number of older adults outnumbered children in 11 states — up from just three states in 2020.Along with that population change came other shifts, including increased demand for care for older people.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for senior care services are rising faster than the price of inflation. In September, the Consumer Price Index rose 3% annually, while prices for nursing homes and adult day services rose more than 4% over the same period.But the labor force hasn't necessarily kept up with the surge.The demand for home care workers is soaring as the gap widens, with a projected 4.6 million unfulfilled jobs by 2032, according to Harvard Public Health. And McKnight's Senior Living, a trade publication that caters to senior care businesses, found that the labor gap for long-term care is more severe than any other sector in health care, down more than 7% since 2020.'A critical labor shortage'That shortage is primarily driven by a combination of low wages, poor job quality and difficulty climbing the ranks, according to experts.\"This is coming for us, and we are going to have this create an enormous need for long-term care,\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber told CNBC.Gruber said the country is entering a period of \"peak demand\" for aging baby boomers, creating a situation where rising demand and pay do not sufficiently match up, leading to a \"critical labor shortage.\"On top of that, the jobs at nursing homes are often strenuous and vary in skills depending on the specific needs of each senior, he said, leading nursing assistants to be staffed in difficult jobs that often only pay slightly more than a retail job, despite requiring more training.According to the BLS' most recent wage data from May 2024, the average base salary for home health and personal care aides was $16.82 per hour, compared with $15.07 per hour for fast food and counter workers.\"If we can create a better caring system with an entitlement to all care for those who need it, that will free millions of workers to make our economy grow, so this is a drag on economic growth,\" Gruber said.Pinsker said she saw that shortage play out firsthand. At one of the assisted living facilities she toured for her mother, she noticed nurses wheeling residents into the dining hall for lunch at 10:30 a.m., an hour and a half before lunch would be served, because the home did not have enough caregivers to retrieve them at noon.\"They were bringing them in one at a time, whoever was available, seating them in rows at their tables, and just leaving them there to sit and wait,\" Pinsker said. \"This was their morning activity for these people in this nursing home. … They just don't have enough people to push them around. That's what a staffing shortage looks like in real time.\"Pinsker said her mother was placed in a nursing rehab facility, unable to walk or get out of bed, and that her facility had zero doctors on the premises. Most often, she said the facility was just staffed with business-level caretakers who change bedpans and clothing.\"They don't have enough doctors and registered nurses and physical therapists and occupational therapists and people to come and check blood pressure and take blood samples and that sort of stuff,\" she said. \"They're short on all ends of the staffing spectrum.\"Filling the gapGruber said there are three directions he thinks the country could go in to solve the labor gap: Pay more for these jobs, allow more immigration to fill the jobs or set up better career ladders within the sector.\"It's not rocket science — you've either got to pay more, or you've got to let in way more people. … There are wonderful, caring people all over the world who would like to come care for our seniors at the wages we're willing to pay, and we just have to let them in,\" Gruber said.He's also part of an initiative in Massachusetts focused on making training more affordable for nurses to be able to climb the career ladder and pipelines to fill the shortages, which he said helps staff more people.For Care.com CEO Brad Wilson, an overwhelming demand for senior care made it clear to the company that it needed to set up a separate category of job offerings. Care.com, which is most known for listing child care service jobs, met the demand and rolled out additional senior care options, as well as a tool for families trying to navigate what would work best for their situations and households.Wilson said the company sees senior care as a $200 billion to $300 billion per year category. Now, it's the company's fastest-growing segment.\"We've heard from families that it's an enormous strain as they go through the senior care aspect of these things, because child care can be a little bit more planned, but sometimes your adult or senior care situation is sudden, and there's a lot to navigate,\" he said.Care.com is also increasingly seeing demand rise for \"house managers,\" Wilson said, who can help multiple people in a single household, as caregiving situations evolve.\"I can't underscore enough ... this is the most unforeseen part of the caregiving journey, and it's increasingly prevalent,\" he added.And as the senior population booms, so too does the so-called sandwich generation, whose members are taking care of both their aging parents and their young children. Wilson said his family is in the thick of navigating caring for older family members while also raising three children.\"By 2034, there will actually be more seniors in this country than children,\" Wilson said, citing Census Bureau statistics. \"Senior care is in a crisis. It's actually the very much unseen part of the caregiving crisis today, and we're really trying to bring some visibility to it and share that we have solutions that can help people.\"",

    "body": "John Williams, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during an Economic Club of New York (ECNY) event in New York, US, on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.David Dee Delgado | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCommunication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.Messages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.That's why a speech Friday from the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed's leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.So when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a \"further adjustment in the near term\" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\"There is some ambiguity in the phrase 'near term' – but its most obvious reading is at the nextmeeting,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note. \"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other membersof the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell's sign-off,\" he added.Williams' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.The policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself suddenly divided. On one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.While Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.That's particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over Fed monetary policy.Stocks briefly rallied Friday, with futures turning around after Williams' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Williams likely saved the market Friday from a bigger selloff with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming on Friday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 5 days\"Williams intervention came after several other Fed speakers indicated reservations about [December] but drew back from categorical statements, perhaps indicating they recognize the [December] struggle was turning into a crisis of governance at the Fed and see the need to give Powell space to make the call,\" Guha said. To be sure, other speakers weren't as enthusiastic as Williams.Regional Fed presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Lorie Logan of Dallas both voiced hesitation about further cuts. In a CNBC interview, Collins expressed concern about inflation. Logan was even more hawkish, saying she wasn't even sure she would have voted for cuts the previous two cuts. Collins votes this year on the FOMC, while Logan gets to vote in 2026.",

    "body": "People cycle along a track backdropped with the city skyline in Singapore on June 27, 2025.         Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty ImagesSingapore raised its 2025 economic outlook Friday after stronger growth in the third quarter, but warned that expansion is likely to cool in 2026 as the U.S. tariffs weigh on global demand.   The Ministry of Trade and Industry upgraded Singapore's 2025 GDP forecast to around 4%, up from an earlier range of 1.5% to 2.5%, largely thanks to the better-than-expected economic growth in the third quarter.  \"Global economic conditions have turned out to be more resilient than expected,\" the MTI said in a statement, citing stronger demand from key trading partners, stronger demand for semiconductor exports tied to the artificial-intelligence boom and the de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions.The economy grew 4.2% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier, extending the second quarter's 4.7% increase, government data showed. The third-quarter growth rate also exceeded the official advance estimate of 2.9% compiled in October and economists' forecast of 4.0% in a Reuters poll, despite elevated trade headwinds during the three months. For 2026, the authorities expected Singapore's economy to grow at a range of 1% to 3%.On a quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted basis, GDP expanded 2.4%, up from 1.7% in the second quarter. The third-quarter growth was mainly driven by manufacturing and export demand, the government said, noting that electronics manufacturing expanded by 6.1%, buoyed by higher demand for AI-related semiconductors and servers.    \"For the rest of the year, demand for AI-related electronics should continue to support our manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors,\" the ministry said.For the first nine months of 2025, the economy grew 4.3% from a year earlier.Although Singapore's economy is expected to hold up relatively well this year, officials cautioned that the growth outlook remains clouded for 2026.  \"GDP growth for most of Singapore's key trading partners is likely to be lower than that in 2025 as the impact of the US' tariffs is expected to be more pronounced,\" the MTI said, cautioning that global economic uncertainty remains elevated. Trade headwinds Singapore's exports to the U.S. are subject to a 10% baseline tariff, relatively low compared with the rates imposed on its Southeast Asian neighbors. But sectoral levies, including a 100% tariff on branded drugs that has been put on hold, remain a key source of worry for Singapore's economy. \"For now, there's still not a lot of clarity around how America intends to apply these sectoral tariffs – for example, where pharmaceuticals are concerned,\" Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said last month, noting that Singapore's trade talks with Washington were at \"a very early stage.\" The implementation of this tariff has been delayed to allow pharmaceutical companies time to negotiate exemptions with the U.S. administration. In the third quarter, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) slipped 3.3% after a 7% rise in the April-to-June period, weighed down by weaker pharmaceutical and petrochemical exports. Shipments to the U.S. fell 30.7% over the same period. But in October, NODX rebounded, surging 22.2% from a year earlier, driven by exports of non-monetary gold and electronic products. Shipments to the U.S. declined 12.5% in October from a year earlier. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is expected to keep its monetary policy stance unchanged in its next meeting in January, as the growth momentum remains largely intact, Lloyd Chan, a strategist at MUFG Bank, said in a note Friday. The central bank left the policy unchanged at its final review of the year in October, citing stable economic performance and subdued inflation.    Singapore's consumer price inflation rose 0.7% in September from a year earlier, in line with the central bank's estimate of 0.5% to 1% this year. ",

    "body": "Shipping container loads dock at Tokyo Bay.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapan's exports in October massively beat expectations, government data on Friday showed, as shipments to Europe and Asia saw robust growth. Exports rose 3.6% year on year compared with Reuters-polled economists' estimates of a 1.1% growth. But it was lower than the 4.2% gain seen in September. Shipments to Asia and Western Europe climbed 4.2% and 8.8% year on year, respectively, helping offset the 2.7% decline in exports to North America as goods shipped to the U.S. fell 3.1%.Automobile shipments, the largest Japanese exports to the U.S. by value, fell 7.5% from a year earlier, but it was much softer drop than the 24.2% decline seen in the prior month. Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said that October data \"paints a mixed picture of current export momentum.\"Yamaguchi noted that while capital goods exports remained sluggish due to subdued machinery investment momentum globally, the worst time for auto exports seems to be behind, and semiconductor exports have improved. Overall, Japan's auto exports rose 0.4% in October, while semiconductor shipments climbed 15.8% year on year.\"While we continue to believe that the lagged impact of higher global tariffs will drag on exports in the near term, recent upgrades to our global outlook point to a more modest adjustment than we had previously expected,\" Yamaguchi said.Diplomatic frictionThe data comes at a time when Japan is locked in a diplomatic spat with its largest trading partner, China, over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments related to Taiwan. The impact on trade from this spat could show up in next month's data. The Asia Group said in a note on Wednesday that mainland China had suspended imports of seafood from Japan. It also pointed to Chinese social media showing some Japanese brand stores in Shanghai and Beijing \"voluntarily\" closing for several days citing \"reasons that everyone know.\"Meanwhile, imports to the world's fourth largest economy unexpectedly rose 0.7%, defying expectations of a 0.7% fall from the Reuters poll. Stronger-than-expected exports data would come as a welcome relief for Japan's economy that struggled in the third quarter. The country's GDP contracted 0.4% quarter on quarter, with net exports dragging the quarterly figure down by 0.2 percentage point. Japan also released its consumer inflation data on Friday, with headline inflation now running above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 43 months in a row. The Nikkei 225 was 2.38% down after the data release, while the Japanese yen rose marginally to trade at 157.39 against the dollar. Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama signaled the possibility of intervening in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMitul Kotecha, head of FX & EM macro strategy for Asia at Barclays, however, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that intervention does not seem to be imminent. \"The problem that the Japanese officials face is that we're still in a broadly positive dollar environment. And as we know, intervention does not work as well when you have the broader market move going against you. It works much better when the move is going with you,\" Kotecha said. He did not entirely disregard chances of an intervention though: \"There's going to be focus on volatility that's going to be important. We hear that from Japanese officials. So may not just be levels, it could also be the pace of the move that could trigger intervention.\"",

International benchmark Brent crude futures with January expiry slipped 2.2% to $62 per barrel at 3:02 p.m. London time (10:02 a.m. ET).

U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron traded 1.1% and 0.6% lower, respectively, on Friday.The bearish market sentiment comes as investors pore over the details of the Trump administration's push to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S., under a widely leaked plan, has reportedly proposed that Ukraine cede land including Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and pledge never to join the NATO military alliance.  The plan also says Kyiv will receive \"reliable\" security guarantees, while the size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel, according to The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the draft proposal. CNBC has not been able to independently verify the report.Analysts were doubtful that the peace plan, which is thought to be favorable toward Russia, would be backed by Ukraine.

The Japanese tech conglomerate recently offloaded its Nvidia shares but still controls British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSouth Korea's SK Hynix fell 8.76%.

Smaller chip players in Asia were not spared either. In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, fell 2.65%.

The headline inflation rate rose to 3%, staying above the BOJ's 2% target for 43 straight months.  The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which strips out prices of fresh food and energy, crept up to at 3.1%, compared to 3% in September. Rice inflation continued to ease for a fifth month in a row, dipping to 40.2% from 49.2% in the previous month. Japan's Nikkei 225 was 1.58% lower, while the yen strengthened 0.1% to trade at 157.5 against the dollar as senior Japanese officials voiced concerns on yen moves.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda told the country's parliament on Friday that the central bank should be mindful that a weak yen could affect underlying inflation by pushing up import costs and broader prices.Signaling urgency over yen weakness, Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama reportedly hinted at a possible intervention in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUeda also had his first bilateral meeting with newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi earlier this week.During the meeting, Ueda told Takaichi the central bank was \"gradually raising interest rates to guide inflation smoothly towards its 2% target and ensure the economy achieves sustainable growth,\" Reuters reported. Takaichi has been an advocate of a loose monetary policy, and earlier this month told the country's parliament that she hoped that the BOJ \"conducts policy appropriately\" so that the 2% inflation target is achieved by wage gains instead of cost-push factors.\"The type of inflation we're seeing now is not good,\" Takaichi reportedly said. The BOJ governor also said that Takaichi did not make any request related to monetary policy.The central bank is currently caught between a rock and a hard place, with inflation running above target and GDP growth figures weakening as Japan takes a hit from U.S. tariffs.Japan's GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4% sequentially, and dipping 1.8% on an annualized basis.",

    "body": "Bitcoin fell sharply after a sell-off of major U.S. stock indices. Bitcoin has been correlated closely to the price movement of the Nasdaq index.Luke MacGregor  | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBitcoin tumbled as much as 6% early Friday, hovering just above its critical $80,000 support level at one point, as investors continued their flight from risk-on assets to more defensive plays. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit $80,548 at around 7:30 a.m. ET. The token's plunge to that price — its lowest since April 11— marks a steepening of bitcoin's decline following widespread cascading liquidations of highly leveraged crypto positions in October. \"Price action has been unimpressive across the large tokens, BTC dipping below the year-start price as long-time and larger holders of the token have become more active,\" Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Friday in a note to clients. \"ETF flows, the main driver of BTC prices, are also drying up, adding to the short-term performance worries.\"Bitcoin has since regained some of its losses to trade down 4% to $82,939.59, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency has fallen 12% since the beginning of the week and roughly 26% over the last month.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin value year to dateThe token's slide follows mounting pressure in the U.S. stock market, which has led investors to rotate out of volatile assets like crypto and artificial intelligence stocks into safe-havens such as gold. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2% on Thursday, as a rally sparked by Nvidia's blockbuster earnings on Wednesday lost steam. Its fizzling underscores investors' increasing scrutiny of sky-high AI valuations. Investors in AI also often hold bitcoin, linking the two trades.Cryptocurrency stocks were also in the red. Strategy, a bitcoin treasury firm, has fallen 2% on the day and is now down 42% over the past month. American Bitcoin and Riot Platforms shed 7% and 4% in Thursday's session, respectively.  Bitcoin is now down 9% since the beginning of the year, despite smashing several price records following President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Amid the administration's pro-crypto policies, it last sailed to a record price just north of $126,000 in early October.  But, it's now more than 30% off that high. \"We're in very oversold territory for bitcoin right now,\" Sebastian Pedro Bea, chief investment officer at crypto asset management firm ReserveOne, told CNBC.",

    "body": "A sign with the company logo sits outside of the headquarters of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, on March 17, 2024.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesEli Lilly reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Friday, the first health-care company in the world to join the exclusive club dominated by tech firms.Eli Lilly briefly hit the $1 trillion mark in morning trading before retreating. It was last trading around $1,048 a share. Eli Lilly is the second non-technology company to reach the coveted $1 trillion mark in the U.S. after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.The drugmaker's stock has climbed more than 36% this year as investors applaud the gains it has made over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 drug space. The Indianapolis, Indiana-based company's stock has been riding the skyrocketing popularity of its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly's stock has soared on the back of the success of its drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.Demand is only expected to grow as approvals for the treatments' uses and insurance coverage expand.The two drugs have driven eye-popping sales growth for Eli Lilly. Last month, the drugmaker said Mounjaro drew in $6.52 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 109% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales during the period, a 184% spike from the prior-year period.Demand for the treatments will only grow as approvals for their use and insurance coverage expand. In addition, the drugmaker expects an oral version of its popular drugs to hit the market next year, which could give patients a more convenient option than a shot that is easier for the company to produce.Eli Lilly will likely remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which some analysts believe could be worth more than $150 billion by the early 2030s. But despite its recent struggles and leadership shakeups, Novo Nordisk remains a formidable rival for Eli Lilly in the space. Pfizer also made a push forward in the market, as well, when it won a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera earlier this month.The runaway success of Zepbound, MounjaroEli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran of the U.S. Civil War, founded his namesake company in 1876. It has long been at the forefront of the diabetes treatment space, introducing the world's first commercial insulin in 1923. Eli Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange by 1952, and for decades relied on a slate of widely successful products to drive much of its profits and revenue. That included insulins, the antidepressant pill Prozac and the earliest polio vaccine. An Eli Lilly & Co. Zepbound injection pen, March 28, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly hit the jackpot with the May 2022 approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, which is sold as Mounjaro. It started to compete with Novo Nordisk's diabetes injection Ozempic, which had entered the market a few years earlier. But Eli Lilly brought a new way to treat diabetes and eventually, obesity. Tirzepatide works by imitating two hormones produced in the gut called GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy, only targets GLP-1. Mounjaro achieved \"blockbuster\" status — meaning it generated more than $1 billion in annual sales — during its first full year on the market. Eli Lilly then won approval in late 2023 for tirzepatide as a treatment for obesity, which is sold as Zepbound and now competes with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. By 2024, Mounjaro pulled in $11.54 billion in sales, while Zepbound posted $4.93 billion in revenue.",

    "body": "Treasury yields were lower on Friday after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams offered some hope to investors that the Fed may lower its key interest rate at its final meeting of 2025 next month.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell more than 3 basis points to trade at 4.069%.

In the day prior to Williams' comments, money markets were pricing in less than a 40% chance of a cut next month.Yields had taken a dive earlier Friday following Thursday's sell-off in U.S. equities, a move spurred by increasing pessimism toward the rate outlook and concerns over valuation levels in the artificial intelligence trade.Global markets are also digesting Thursday's delayed nonfarm payrolls report, which showed the economy added more jobs than expected in September, but the unemployment rate also rose to 4.4% — its highest level since Oct. 2021.",

    "body": "Shoppers walk past a GAP fashion retail store on Oxford Street on October 30, 2025 in  London, United Kingdom.  John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesApparel retailer Gap said Thursday its comparable sales rose 5% during the fiscal third quarter, driven by strong revenue at its namesake brand after its viral \"Better in Denim\" campaign with girl group Katseye. Putting aside pandemic-related spikes, the rise in comparable sales is the strongest growth for Gap since its fiscal 2017 holiday quarter and is well ahead of Wall Street expectations of 3.1%, according to StreetAccount. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Richard Dickson said the company hasn't needed to discount as often to sell products, it's winning customers from all income cohorts and it's seeing a \"great start\" to the holiday shopping season. \"While external data points to macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are finding our price value, [and] our styles are breaking through the competitive landscape,\" said Dickson. \"Our product is resonating. So we're very confident as we head into the holiday season.\" Shares of Gap rose 5% in extended trading Thursday. Here's how the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S. performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $3.94 billion vs. $3.91 billion expectedThe company's net income during the three months ended Nov. 1 declined nearly 14% to $236 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.94 billion, up 3% from $3.83 billion a year earlier. For Gap's fiscal year, which is slated to end around early February, the company is now guiding to the high end of its previously released sales forecast, expecting sales to rise between 1.7% and 2%, in line with analyst expectations. It previously expected sales to rise between 1% and 2%.The company is now expecting its full-year operating margin to be around 7.2%, compared to its previous range of between 6.7% and 7%. The forecast includes the impact of tariffs, estimated to be between 1 and 1.1 percentage points. Comparable sales across Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic, have been positive now for seven straight quarters. Under Dickson, the company has been as focused on boosting profitability and fixing operations as it has been on reigniting cultural relevance, which has led to sustained sales growth across the portfolio. Gap's profitability had been growing, too, as a result, but now that it's facing tariffs, the retailer's gross margin and net income are both taking a hit. During the quarter, Gap's gross margin fell 0.3 percentage points to 42.4% but still came in higher than expectations of 41.2%, according to StreetAccount. The 14% decline in Gap's net income was primarily related to tariffs, finance chief Katrina O'Connell said in an interview. Gap's better-than-expected results come as apparel sales remain generally soft across the industry and consumers pull back on nice-to-have items like new clothes in favor of necessities. Aside from clear value players like Walmart and TJX Companies, earnings so far this season have been muted, with some companies blaming macroeconomic conditions and expressing caution about the holiday season. Dickson said Gap's varied portfolio gives it a hedge in uncertain economic times because it can capture shoppers in a variety of different places. \"Our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers, which is giving us great flexibility in today's environment,\" said Dickson. Here's a closer look at how each of the company's brands performed: Gap Gap's namesake brand has been the focus of Dickson's turnaround strategy since he took the helm as CEO just over two years ago. During the quarter, comparable sales rose a staggering 7% – more than double the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Revenue rose 6% to $951 million. During the quarter, Gap released its viral \"Milkshake\" campaign, featuring the early-aughts Kelis song and members of the Katseye pop group. The campaign helped sales, but Dickson said Gap brand's growth is \"a story about consistency\" and a mix of better product, marketing and partnerships. Old Navy Sales at Old Navy, Gap's largest brand by revenue, rose 5% to $2.3 billion with comparable sales up 6%, far better than the 3.8% that analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected. The company said it saw growth in key categories like denim, activewear, kids and baby. Banana Republic The elevated, work-friendly brand is still in turnaround mode but saw sales grow 1% to $464 million during the quarter with comparable sales up 4%, better than the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. This was the second quarter in a row Banana reported positive comparable sales, which the company attributed to better marketing and product. Athleta Both revenue and comparable sales at Athleta were down a whopping 11% to $257 million, an eyesore on Gap's otherwise better-than-expected results. Dickson has repeatedly said Athleta is in a reset year, but how long that reset will take remains unclear. \"We have been disappointed in the trend. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but I really do believe in the brand,\" said Dickson. \"I believe in the leadership and we will continue to build this brand for the long term. It does deserve it.\"",

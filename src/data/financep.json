    "body": "In November, AirHelp, a service that helps airline passengers claim compensation for flight disruptions, released its annual ranking of the best U.S. airlines. To determine the ranking, the organization looked at on-time performance, claim processing and customer experience — analyzing data from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025. Each airline was given a score out of 10.According to the report, AirHelp considered an on-time flight to be \"any flight that arrived within 15 minutes of its published arrival time.\" For claim processing, the organization assessed each airline based on how they treat their customers when things go wrong. And for the customer experience category, passengers were asked to give their opinion on five factors: cabin crew, aircraft comfort, aircraft cleanliness, food and entertainment.To ensure AirHelp's database ranks among the most accurate available, the company says they cross-reference their statistics with a variety of sources, including airport databanks, flight-tracking vendors, and government agencies. 2025 was a challenging year for U.S. airlines, Eric Napoli, Chief Legal Officer at AirHelp, tells CNBC Make It. The government shutdown that lasted a little over a month, had a significant impact on air traffic and travel, he says.For example, on-time performance really took a hit, he says: \"We saw that operational challenge this year.\"According to Napoli, American, United, and Delta work fairly well with AirHelp to make sure that customers who file claims — flight cancellations, lost baggage — get paid. But it's still an area they can improve in, he adds. \"Different airlines have their own operational modes but with claims processing, they should make it less difficult for customers to actually claim what's due to them under law,\" he says.American Airlines is the best U.S. airline for on-time performance, customer satisfaction and moreWith a score of 7.64, American Airlines is the best U.S. airline, AirHelp says. On the company's global ranking, American Airlines came in at No. 11. The airline had a score of 7.1 for on-time performance, 8 for customer opinion and 7.8 for claim processing. Napoli says that American Airlines beat out both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines because it was better in one key category. \"They weren't as efficient and quick in claims processing as they were before, but they did outdo United Airlines,\" he says. \"They were able to get passengers their compensation quicker.\" American AirlinesGrant Baldwin | Getty ImagesAmerican is one of the world's largest airlines. It serves more than 300 destinations and operates a fleet of over 900 aircraft. The airline was a pioneer in loyalty programs, launching its frequent flyer program in 1979. American Airlines is also a founding member of the Oneworld alliance, which includes other partner airlines worldwide like British Airways, and Qatar Airways.The best U.S. airlines for on-time performance and moreAmerican Airlines – 7.64United Airlines – 7.54Delta Airlines – 7.46Frontier Airlines – 7.07Hawaiian Airlines –  6.73Southwest – 6.68Alaska Airlines – 5.95JetBlue – 5.31United Airlines is the No. 2 U.S. airline, according to AirHelp. It received a score of 7.54 and took 13th place in the global ranking. It got a score of 7.4 for on-time performance, 8.1 for customer opinion and 7.2 for claim processing. Napoli says United performed better than the rest in on-time performance and customer opinion, but ultimately fell short in the claim processing category.  United AirlinesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines serves more than 350 destinations and is part of the Star Alliance. The global partnership includes other carriers like Lufthansa and Air Canada. In 2025, United added routes from Newark, New Jersey, and Tokyo, Japan, to new destinations like Nuuk, Greenland; Palermo, Italy and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, bringing its total international destinations served to 147, according to Britannica.

    "description": "Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust, a Baillie Gifford-run technology-focused fund, is calling on shareholders to throw out a plan by Boaz Weinstein'",
    "body": "Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust, a Baillie Gifford-run technology-focused fund, is calling on shareholders to throw out a plan by Boaz Weinstein's activist investment fund Saba Capital to overhaul its board of directors.The EWIT board said on Wednesday it would \"strongly urge\" shareholders to reject a plan by the U.S. hedge fund  — which holds a 30% stake in the trust — to remove the incumbent board and appoint three directors in their place.In an update on Wednesday, the trust's chair, Jonathan Simpson-Dent, said Saba was \"an aggressive U.S. hedge fund\" which wants to \"seize control for its own commercial advantage, at the expense of other shareholders.\"Simpson-Dent said the trust has made \"strong progress\" over the past 12 months.Saba Capital said the sweeping board-level changes were needed to reverse what it sees as \"unprecedented value destruction\" at the trust over the past five years. In a recent letter to shareholders, the firm said its three proposed directors — Gabi Gliksberg, Michael Joseph and Jassen Trenkow — could \"deliver the performance our shareholders rightfully expect.\"As the largest shareholder, Saba has secured a General Meeting — expected to take place early next year — where it will ask shareholders to vote on its resolutions for board replacements.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"We urge Saba to explain to EWIT shareholders its intentions beyond replacing the Board, to allow shareholders to make an informed choice in January rather than face considerable uncertainty should it succeed,\" Simpson-Dent said.He highlighted the trust's NAV total return of 16.2%, outperforming the 6% achieved by its benchmark, the S&P Global Small Cap Index. He also said a share buyback programme had contributed to an average discount of 5.3% over the past 12 months, \"significantly narrower\" than its peer group average of 17.9%.Saba's plan follows a previous attempt to replace the EWIT board in February, which investors rejected. Since then, Weinstein's firm has increased its stake to 30%, allowing it to block a proposed merger between EWIT and another Baillie Gifford fund, the US Growth Trust, earlier this month.'A storm brewing'Relations between the two camps have become increasingly acrimonious amid a protracted wrangle over EWIT's discount. Weinstein declared he had \"no confidence\" that the incumbents could improve the outlook and protect shareholder capital.\"Many shareholders gave the Board the benefit of the doubt, enabling the directors to remain,\" Saba Capital said. \"Simply put, the Board requested more time to make improvements but failed to generate adequate performance.\"The Saba founder has sharpened his focus on closed-end funds and investment trusts on both sides of the Atlantic in recent years, identifying investment opportunities arising from persistent valuation discounts. At the Sohn London investment conference last month, the New York-based fund manager said there was \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust space.EWIT's portfolio — which is sized at around $847 million — comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on disruptive tech innovation.Its largest position is Elon Musk's SpaceX, accounting for almost 16% of its total assets. That position has become a major flashpoint in the dispute.In a post on X on Tuesday night, Weinstein accused Ballie Gifford of selling one-third of SpaceX shares in both the EWIT and U.S. Growth trusts at \"a level massively lower\" than the reported $1.5 trillion valuation that the rocket maker could reach in a future IPO. He earlier posted that Saba had received calls from shareholders \"livid\" at the sale.EWIT said on Wednesday that it offers investors a \"unique and distinctive portfolio of disruptive and transformative companies positioned for long-term growth,\" which includes exposure to SpaceX.",

This is what to expect:European Central BankThe ECB is expected to keep rates on hold, with recent economic data not pointing to an adjustment.But investors will be more interested in any commentary on the apparent growing tensions inside the governing council, with some members, like Isabel Schnabel, openly endorsing the market's view that the next rate move will be a hike, while others think there is still room to cut. Christian Kopf, who heads the bond portfolio management of German asset manager Union Investment, told CNBC: \"I don't expect and rate change in the Euro area for the time being. If there is a change in 2026, most likely we will get a rate hike towards the end of 2026 or at the beginning of 2027.\"The ECB is expected to hike its growth outlook for the Eurozone when publishing its new round of staff projections, its in-house economic forecasts.CNBC will be covering the ECB's monetary policy decision from 1 p.m. London time, with guests including   Lorenzo Codogno, founder of Lorenzo Codogno Macro Advisors, and Al Cattermole, Fixed Income portfolio manager at Mirabaud Asset Management.Norges BankNorway's central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold at 4% on Thursday, with economists suggesting the next rate cut might not come until summer 2026. Norges Bank announces its policy decision at 10 a.m. local time, 9 a.m. London time.Morten Lund, Scandinavia chief economist at JPMorgan, commented that the bank's guidance on Thursday \"should be a push-back against markets' rising expectations\" that it will cut rates in March, which he said was currently seen as \"a coin toss.\"Norges BankTomm W. Christiansen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstead, JPMorgan expects a rate cut to next take place in June, although Norges Bank was unlikely to be explicit about the timing of a cut.\"Forward guidance should remain vague, stating that 'if the economy evolves broadly as currently projected, the policy rate will be reduced further in the course of the coming year'. We also think that the Governor will say that inflation remains too high and repeat the sentence that \"we are not in a hurry to reduce the policy rate',\" Lund added. CNBC will be interviewing Ida Wolden Bache, the governor of Norges Bank, at 12.10 p.m. London time, 1.10 p.m. CET. Riksbank Sweden's central bank is expected to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 1.75% when it announces its decision at 9.30 a.m. CET, 8.30 a.m. London time.No change is likely in the coming quarters either, according to Franziska Fischer at UBS Investment Bank, who said that the Riksbank's easing cycle was over.The Swedish flag hangs on the country's central bank.Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images\"The Riksbank cut the policy rate by 25 basis points in September but remained on hold in November, while signalling that the policy rate will likely remain unchanged 'for some time to come',\" Fischer said.Developments since November do not warrant a change to the rate outlook, in UBS' view, he added. CNBC will be interviewing Erik Thedeen, Riksbank governor, on Thursday at 1.20 p.m. CET, 12:20 p.m. London time. Bank of England The Bank of England is the only central bank that's expected to cut interest rates on Thursday, with a small majority of the bank's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) expected to opt for a 25 basis points cut, bringing the base rate down to 3.75%.Expectations of a cut rose after the latest inflation data showed it fell sharply to 3.2% in November, and recent downbeat economic data in the U.K., ranging from somber growth figures to an uptick in unemployment.

    "body": "President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Aug. 6, 2025.Bonnie Cash | UPI | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe main challenge for the global economy in 2025 can be summed up neatly in one word, \"tariffs,\" with President Donald Trump upending longstanding U.S.' trading relationships when he announced in April new import duties and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries.Months of policy pivots and fraught negotiations followed, with some countries able to strike deals with the White House to either lower — as in the case with Switzerland — or pause and delay, as with China — a raft of higher duties on goods and commodities sent to the States. Trade tariffs have become the weapon of choice for Washington as it seeks to — in its view — redress trade imbalances with a number of major trading partners, such as China and the European Union, that it feels have been disproportionate and unfair.While trade deals have been agreed this year, with the U.K., EU, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia all agreeing framework accords with the U.S., work goes on behind the scenes to implement those agreements.And all the time, there is massive uncertainty over the fate of global tariffs, with the Supreme Court set to rule on the legality of Trump's \"reciprocal\" duties. Trump, for his part, has said the U.S. faces \"economic disaster\" if the court rules against the duties.Below is a list of the tariffs currently in place, as of December 2025: Of course, there are countries that have failed to win over Trump and his trade officials, including Brazil and India, which have been slapped with 50% levies. That was after Trump declared that Brazilian government policies were a threat to the U.S., while India was hit with increased levies over its Russian oil purchases. Duties on U.S. neighbours Mexico and Canada were in play long before the reciprocal tariff announcement earlier this year. They face levies of 25% and 35%, respectively, on goods not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade (USMCA) agreement, which itself is up for review in 2026. As things stand, the U.S. is still deliberating over whether to stick with that or create bilateral deals instead. ",

    "body": "TOKYO, JAPAN - FEBRUARY 03: SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son delivers a speech during an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, Japan, on February 03, 2025. SoftBank and OpenAI announced that they have agreed a partnership to set up a joint venture for artificial intelligence services in Japan.Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesJapanese tech stocks took a tumble on Thursday as AI infrastructure spending worries on Wall Street crossed the ocean into the Asian markets, with AI-related stocks declining.Softbank Group Corp was among the top losers in the benchmark Nikkei 225, falling as much as 7.25%, with the index leading losses in Asia, down 1.23%. The group pared some losses and was last trading 3% lower.This decline comes as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.81% overnight, dragged by losses in Oracle, Broadcom, Nvidia and other AI plays. The losses in Oracle came after the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Blue Owl Capital's plans to finance the cloud infrastructure company's $10 billion Michigan data center had stalled. The company last week had refuted a report that said it had delayed some projects for AI major OpenAI to 2028.Tech-focused SoftBank has seen sharp volatility in its stock over the past month as fears over AI-related spending have gripped the market. At the start of the year, the group had revealed plans to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. along with OpenAI, Oracle and other partners, and in September it announced five new U.S. AI data center sites under Stargate, OpenAI's overarching AI infrastructure platform.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOther Japanese tech stocks also fell. Semiconductor equipment supplier Advantest, dropped as much as 5%. Counterparts Lasertec, Renesas Electronics and Tokyo Electron declined between 3% and 4%. Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, said much of what goes into data centers, power centers, and AI hardware enablers is \"Made in Japan, and can only be made in Japan.\" That makes Japanese tech, especially AI-related stocks more vulnerable to any worries around U.S. tech spending.  On Wednesday, Japan's trade numbers showed that exports of electrical machinery jumped 7.4%, and semiconductor-related exports surged 13% year on year. Koll said the U.S.-led boom in tech spending was translating into growing exports of specialized machinery and equipment.Losses were less pronounced in South Korean chip heavyweight Samsung Electronics at 0.93%, while SK Hynix reversed course to gain 0.73%. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, was marginally down. ",

(Photo by Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIt felt like déjà vu when shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits soared 700% in its Shanghai market debut on Wednesday. Moore Threads surged over 400% on its first day of trading just two weeks earlier.They're the latest Chinese AI chip companies the country's investors are ploughing money into, as it races to develop its own semiconductors and challenge Nvidia's dominance in the face of U.S. export curbs.Both are developing graphics processing units (GPUs), the type of chip manufactured by Nvidia and used for advanced AI.Investor enthusiasm around Chinese AI-chip IPOs is partly shaped by longer-term expectations that China will build a self-sufficient semiconductor ecosystem as tensions with the U.S. continue, Macquarie's equity analyst Eugene Hsiao told CNBC.watch nowWashington has barred sales of Nvidia's most advanced semiconductors to the country. While U.S. President Donald Trump relaxed export curbs for some Nvidia chips, regulators in the country were planning to limit access to the company's processors, the Financial Times reported earlier this month, as it looks to wean itself off overseas tech in the AI race. None of China's AI chipmakers — which include a cohort of tech giants like Huawei, Alibaba and Baidu — have been able to develop processors comparable to Nvidia's most advanced so far.But while significant barriers remain in overcoming export control restrictions in some areas of its chip supply chain, like equipment, it's made significant strides in others, such as memory.  Here's how the market of China's AI chip Nvidia rivals is shaping up.HuaweiPrivately-owned tech giant Huawei develops the Ascend series of chips, with its next-generation model, the 950, to be launched in 2026. Nvidia told CNBC that \"competition has undeniably arrived\" when the new systems were announced.While its previous Ascend models have not been considered competitive with Nvidia's on a chip-by-chip basis, Huawei has been able to build high-performance \"clusters\" to rival the US chipmaker's most advanced systems by linking more of its processors.\"This strategy relies on high-speed, potentially optical interconnects to move data quickly across large clusters – a setup that doesn't require top-end chips and therefore suits China's current strengths,\" Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC in November.watch nowBaiduChina's biggest search platform, Baidu, has increasingly funneled more resources into AI and is a majority shareholder in chip designer Kunlunxin. In November, the company unveiled a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, unveiling new processors in 2026 and 2027.Baidu, which is traded on the Nasdaq, uses a combination of self-developed chips and Nvidia products in its data centers to run its in-house AI models. The company has looked to position itself as a \"full-stack\" provider, producing chips, servers, data centers, and AI models and applications.\"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high-performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note in November.JPMorgan said in a November note that it viewed the Kunlun AI chip as one of the \"best-positioned\" as Chinese hyperscalers increasingly source from local solution providers.AlibabaE-commerce giant Alibaba — which is sometimes compared with Amazon as it is one of the biggest cloud providers locally — began developing AI chips in the late 2010s. It was developing a new AI chip in August, CNBC reported, specifically designed for inference rather than training.Alibaba's share rose in September after reports that the company had secured a major customer for its AI chips.  \"Improved performance of its self-developed chip\" was one of the factors that supported revenue growth in the cloud division at Alibaba, Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said in September.CambriconCambricon, which is developing chips for AI training and inference, posted record profits in the first half of 2025 as revenue surged. The chipmaker, founded in 2016, said revenue rose more than 4,000% year-on-year to 2.88 billion Chinese yuan ($402.7 million) and net profit hit a record 1.04 billion yuan.\"We view Cambricon as the most plausible winner in China's AI accelerator market, which is still at its early stage when compared to the US market on chip accessibility issue,\" Jamie Mills O'Brien, investment director at investment group Aberdeen, told CNBC by email.\"We see multiple roadblocks being digested in next 1-2 years, including fab maturity, client acceptance, and ecosystem formation, which is likely to set Cambricon a 'good enough' alternative to Nvidia's downgraded chips in China.\" An illustration photo shows Moore Threads logo in a smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China on October 30, 2025.

    "body": "watch nowOracle stock dipped 5% on Wednesday following a report that discussions with Blue Owl Capital on backing a $10 billion data center in Michigan had stalled, although the cloud company later disputed the report. Blue Owl had been in talks with Oracle about funding a 1-gigawatt facility for OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan, according to the Financial Times.However, the plans fell through due to concerns about Oracle's rising debt levels and extensive artificial intelligence spending, the FT reported, citing people familiar with the matter.This comes as some investors raise red flags about the funding behind the rush to build ever more data centers. The concern is that some hyperscalers are turning to private equity markets rather than funding the buildings themselves, and entering into lease agreements that could prove risky.Other AI names also sank on Wednesday, with Broadcom down 4%, Nvidia down 3%, AMD down 5% and CoreWeave falling 7%.Blue Owl did look into the project, but pulled out due to unfavorable debt terms and the structure of repayments, according to a person familiar with the company's plans who asked not to be named in order to discuss a confidential matter.Blue Owl is still involved in two other Oracle sites, the person said.The person added that Blue Owl was also concerned that local politics in Michigan would cause construction delays.Oracle later responded to the FT report, saying the project was moving forward and that Blue Owl was not part of equity talks.\"Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Oracle spokesperson Michael Egbert said in a statement.The cloud company did not name the firm involved in current equity talks for the project.Read more CNBC tech newsApple punted on AI this year.

This is an exceptional project that drew significant interest from equity partners,\" Related Digital spokesperson Natalie Ravitz told CNBC.Ravitz said the equity partner working on the project has \"unparalleled expertise in the space\" but did not name the firm.The site, which is expected to begin construction in the first quarter next year, is currently in pre-construction with \"strong support\" from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, she added.CNBC has reached out to the FT for comment.The FT said that Blackstone is in discussions to potentially replace Blue Owl Capital as a financial partner for the data center, although no deal has been signed yet.Blue Owl Capital has been the primary investor in Oracle's data center projects in the U.S., including a $15 billion center in Abilene, Texas, and an $18 billion site in New Mexico, the FT said. \"This appears to be a case where the deal simply wasn't the right one, and seasoned investors understand that success does not require winning every transaction,\" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.The bank added that digital infrastructure remains a \"core growth vertical\" for the Blue Owl, noting an upcoming digital infrastructure fund in 2026 that would add to its $7 billion fund announced in May.Oracle has $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments over the next 15 to 19 years as of Nov. 30, the company said in its latest quarterly filing. That is up almost 148% from August.In September, the cloud computing giant raised $18 billion in new debt, according to an SEC filing. That same month, OpenAI announced a $300 billion partnership with Oracle over the next five years.By the end of November, the company owed over $124 billion, including operating lease liabilities, according to the filing.Oracle shares are down about 50% from the high of $345.72 reached in September.Read the full FT story here.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconYear-to-date Oracle stock chart.",

    "body": "British oil giant BP has appointed Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill as its next CEO, replacing Murray Auchincloss after less than two years in the role. Auchincloss will step down today, with Carol Howle, BP's executive vice president for supply, trading and shipping set to serve as interim CEO until O'Neill takes over the role on April 1. She will be BP's fourth CEO in six years.Auchincloss stepped up from his previous role as chief financial officer to the top job in January 2024, after his predecessor Bernard Looney left the company for failing to disclose a relationship with a colleague. Looney, who had been in the role since early 2020 when he succeeded Bob Dudley, had sought to transform the oil major into a green energy giant but came under investor pressure amid share underperformance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconA graph showing BP's share priceAuchincloss reversed that strategy, and focused on the company's core gas and oil units. In the Wednesday statement, Auchincloss said he'd told recently appointed Chair Albert Manifold he was open to stepping down if an \"appropriate leader\" was identified.BP fielded off takeover rumors earlier this year, with fellow U.K. energy incumbent Shell denying reports that it was in talks to snap up its its struggling competitor. The London-listed oil exploration company that was founded in 1909 under the name Anglo-Persian Oil Company, has underperformed compared with its peers, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024. Meg O'Neill, chief executive officer of Woodside Energy Group Ltd., attends the company's annual general meeting in Perth, Australia on Thursday, May 8, 2025. Photographer: Matt Jelonek/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHowever, BP's fundamental strategic reset that saw it U-turn on green pledges, shake-up its leadership, launch a cost-cutting program and a string of oil discoveries, helped ease pressure. BP's share price is up over 15% year-to-date and 21% over the past five years. The stock ended Thursday up 0.7% as investors responded to the leadership announcement.Holding the line O'Neill will likely hold the line, drawing on more than two-and-a-half decades of experience in the oil and gas industry, including 23 yeas at U.S. giant ExxonMobil. She chairs the Australian oil and gas industry body Australian Energy Producers (AEP) and is a board member of the American Petroleum Institute. She also served on the board of the Business Council of Australia. Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Future Investment Initiative Institute in Saudi Arabia in October about Woodside Energy's strategy, O'Neill said that the firm's investments are made by looking at the demand profile \"for decades to come\" — which led it to liquified natural gas (LNG).Oil majors, including BP, have pushed hard into LNG production, which is considered a bridge fuel by the likes of the European Commission, given it is cleaner than coal. watch now\"We've got deep conviction around the role of LNG as in many ways, finding the sweet spot between reliability, affordability and sustainability. When we talk to customers in places like North Asia and Europe and ask them what they want, they say 'we want all three factors',\" she said.When customers are asked whether they are willing to pay for more climate-friendly products, \"the answer is often zero or near zero,\" she added. \"So that has underpinned our focus on LNG.\" At the time, Woodside expected LNG demand to grow 50% over the coming decade.Woodside Energy's stock price closed Wednesday's session 1.3% lower.",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday expressed trepidation about circular transactions between tech companies as Wall Street weighs the value of artificial intelligence heavy hitter OpenAI.\"These days, we're constantly hearing about what I'd call these 'Lazy Susan' deals, except they're being celebrated as good news for both parties,\" he said.To Cramer, a \"Lazy Susan\" deal occurs when one company gives another money, and in exchange, the recipient invests some of that money back into the other company. He referenced recent news that OpenAI is currently in talks with Amazon to receive at least $10 billion from the online retailer. In return, the ChatGPT maker would buy Amazon's artificial intelligence chips. Cramer said he finds the deal \"quizzical,\" wondering if it would make more sense for OpenAI to just buy the chips itself. He mused that it's possible companies are so eager to be involved with OpenAI that they're willing to invest money just to get it back. However, Cramer stressed that he's becoming more and more concerned about these kinds of moves.There are signs some companies are starting to shy away from lofty tech investments, Cramer said, especially as investors scrutinize OpenAI's enormous spending commitments — including its deal to buy $300 billion worth of AI infrastructure from Oracle. He noted that a Wednesday report said Blue Owl Capital pulled out of funding a $10 billion data center from Oracle as the firm worries about the tech company's spending and growing debt. Cramer lauded Blue Owl Capital's move, saying the firm is exercising \"discipline.\" Tech stocks can't rally until more hyperscalers also display discipline and ease up on their AI spending, he continued.\"It's simply not safe to bet on these stocks yet, until someone says no to these kinds of circular deals and calls them for what they really are, 'Lazy Susan' deals.\"watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Amazon.Questions for Cramer?

Trump claimed in October without evidence that each of the boats is \"responsible for the death of 25,000 American people, and the destruction of families.\" As Trump's speech was about to begin, the U.S. Southern Command announced on X that it had conducted a strike on a vessel in the Eastern Pacific that was \"engaged in narco-trafficking operations.\" Four men aboard the boat were killed, U.S. Southern Command said.According to the Government Accountability Office, fentanyl is the primary cause of overdose deaths in the U.S. and mostly comes from China and Mexico through the Southern border. On Tuesday, Trump designated the Venezuelan government a \"terrorist\" organization and ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country. He told Politico last week that he would not rule out a ground invasion of Venezuela.\"We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world and it's not even close.

    "body": "watch nowThe WNBA Players Association executive director told CNBC she remains \"frustrated\" by the lack of progress toward a new collective bargaining agreement as the league's new deadline to reach a deal approaches. \"We're a little frustrated with where we are right now, but we are holding to our principles,\" Terri Jackson, executive director of the WNBPA, told CNBC Sport in an interview. \"We're staying open to the fact that these negotiations will continue, because they must. We'll be at the table for as long as they take, and we're hopeful that there's enough folks on the team side of things that will start to push these things along.\" Jackson told CNBC Sport she continues to negotiate with WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, her counterpart in the talks, on a new labor deal for the league. The CBA, or labor contract, between the WNBA and its players expired on Oct. 31, but the deadline to strike a new agreement was extended to Jan. 9 when the sides failed to reach a deal.WNBA players are looking for significant pay increases to get a bigger cut of the league's revenue growth. The WNBA signed a media rights deal last year that amounted to a sixfold increase in revenue. The league and its players have been actively negotiating for months over issues related to salaries, benefits, working conditions and revenue sharing. Jackson declined to mention specifics about where the negotiations have stalled, citing her nondisclosure agreement, but added, \"Everything seems to still be a sticking point.\"  A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces drives to the basket against the Phoenix Mercury during Game 4 of the 2025 WNBA Finals at PHX Arena in Phoenix, Oct. 10, 2025.Mike Lawrence | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesThe WNBA's latest proposal to the union includes increasing the maximum salary to $1 million per season, with revenue sharing that could push that number to more than $1.2 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. The current supermax contract is just under $250,000 a year. The new proposal would also increase the average annual salary to more than $500,000, with the league minimum projected to be over $225,000, said the person. Currently, the league minimum is just over $66,000. As part of the proposed revenue sharing agreement, players would see pay increases built in each year. The terms of the revenue sharing have been a point of contention in the talks. The WNBPA recently proposed that players receive 30% of total league and team revenue, or more than double what the league proposed, The Athletic reported. Jackson, who is spearheading negotiations on behalf of the players, said that despite the frustrations, the union remains hopeful that it can get a deal done before the imposed deadline. \"It's hard for us to understand why we are so far apart on the things that we should be closer to that should be so easy, but it seems as though at times, the league and the team come into the negotiating room with a mentality that pay equity is optional, and pay equity is not optional,\" Jackson said.Jackson emphasized that she's working hard to get a deal done by Jan. 9.\"Will there be another extension? There shouldn't be another extension,\" she said. \"There doesn't need to be another extension. We understand their position and point of view. They understand our position and point of view.\"As the WNBA enjoys record growth in television ratings, attendance and sponsorship, the one thing that could stall that momentum would be a work stoppage if the sides cannot come to terms, Jackson said. Several WNBA stars have already expressed their desire to avoid any missed games. The WNBA season begins in May 2026. Engelbert said in October that the league wants to avoid a lockout. \"Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Nneka Ogwumike and Napheesa Collier ... have all said that and that a work stoppage would be catastrophic,\" Jackson said. \"Nobody wants to see that happen.\" Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.",

    "body": "People shop at a grocery store in Brooklyn on Dec. 12, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesWall Street is awaiting Thursday's release of the November consumer price index report, as it will mark the first reading for the period since the record-setting U.S. government shutdown ended last month.According to economists surveyed by Dow Jones, the report – which tracks the average change in prices people pay for a range of goods and services – is expected to show a 12-month inflation rate of 3.1%. When excluding food and energy, core CPI is forecast to post an annual rate of 3.0%.The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said the release \"will not include 1-month percent changes for November 2025 where the October 2025 data are missing,\" as the agency canceled the October inflation report in late November, weeks before the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year. September's CPI data – the most recent CPI report to be published and only piece of economic data released during the shutdown – showed an annual reading of 3.0% for the headline and core measures.\"The psychological distinction between a two handle and a three handle is going to be paramount,\" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in an interview with CNBC.While the consensus estimate shows the annual rate hitting the 3% threshold for the month, the senior economist is anticipating the headline and core readings to be lower than expected at 2.9% each, though he thinks that the range of possible outcomes for headline could be between that figure and 3.1%.If the report were to show a 2.9% reading, it could offer some positive momentum in stocks heading into 2026. In fact, Torres believes that such a number would clear the path for a so-called Santa Claus rally. He also thinks it would have an impact on the interest rate outlook for next year – a period during which the Fed projects one rate cut.\"It really would strengthen monetary policy easing expectations in the last inflation report – CPI report – of 2025 if we could keep inflation in the twos rather than it increasing up to the threes, because that'll allow more interest rate cuts next year,\" Torres added.Not a 'clean' reportWhile the release could help pave the way for a year-end rally, there would need to be other catalysts in store for that to happen, because others like Victoria Fernandez of Crossmark Global Investments don't see a 0.1 percentage point move in either direction as leading to some \"huge\" market reaction. She also thinks that Fed policymakers would still be in wait-and-see mode even with a 2.9% reading.\"I think it's going to be varied. This is not going to be a clean CPI number,\" the firm's chief market strategist said, citing the absence of month-over-month data as one factor and when exactly the BLS was able to begin collecting the November data as another.U.S. President Donald Trump signs the funding bill to end the U.S. government shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 12, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump officially signed a funding bill into law on Nov. 12, reopening the government after 43 days of stoppage – the longest duration in U.S. history. That prompted the BLS to push back November's CPI report from its previously scheduled release date of Dec. 10.\"By the time the government actually opened and they started collecting data, we were almost halfway through the month of November, so you're only getting the last half of the month,\" Fernandez said. \"You have to start wondering, 'Is there some kind of a bias in terms of what prices do and how things work in the latter half of the month versus the beginning of a month?'\"Ultimately, the strategist thinks the overall theme will be that inflation is \"remaining high\" and that it's not making its way back towards 2% like some anticipate.\"We have a tremendous amount of uncertainty as to where we're going from here, because we have conflicting stories,\" Fernandez said. \"We can have weak trends in unemployment, weak household income, consumer spending weak, and then we can have the expectation of 14% earnings growth next year and strong revenues. All the puzzle pieces don't quite fit together.\"\"We just need more information before we can make a true statement as to what the long term is going to look like,\" she continued.",

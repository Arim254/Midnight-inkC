    "description": "Some renters will soon be able to pay their rent using a buy now, pay later plan through financial technology company Affirm, which offers installment",
    "body": "Some renters will soon be able to pay their rent using a buy now, pay later plan through financial technology company Affirm, which offers installment-based payment plans for consumers at a wide variety of retailers.Affirm will partner with fintech company Esusu to provide renters with \"a flexible option for managing one of their largest monthly expenses,\" an Affirm spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNBC Make It. Esusu offers memberships starting at $10 a month for services to help users build credit, including reporting rent payments to credit agencies. Eligible renters will be able to use Affirm through Esusu to pay their rent in two equal, biweekly payments with 0% interest and no late fees, the spokesperson said. The offering is rolling out through a pilot program, and the companies have not yet announced a launch date. Esusu's recently launched split pay option already allows its plus and premium membership subscribers to break up rent payments throughout the month after an initial down payment, according to its website. The partnership with Affirm will give Esusu members another option to split their rent into two payments. Plus and premium memberships, which cost $35 and $50 a month, respectively, are only available to residents at Esusu-partnered properties, according to its website.Nationally, rents in the U.S. were up about 3% in December 2025 compared with the previous year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. And nearly half of all renters spent more than the recommended 30% of their income on housing costs in 2023, according to the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates.A new payment option won't solve the 'underlying affordability issue'Some financial experts are skeptical of using buy now, pay later plans for fixed costs like monthly rent.Using a buy now, pay later plan for rent \"could be useful in a true pinch or short-term emergency,\" says Chris Jackson, a certified financial planner based in South Carolina. However, \"relying on it consistently would be a mistake, particularly for people who already struggle keeping up with rent payments.\"Borrowing to cover your rent won't solve the \"underlying affordability issue,\" he adds. Douglas Boneparth, a CFP, founder of Bone Fide Wealth and member of CNBC's financial advisor council, encourages anyone struggling to pay rent to work directly with their landlord to work out a payment agreement, rather than turning to a lender.Boneparth has previously criticized installment plans for encouraging overspending and targeting consumers \"who are most susceptible to borrowing when they shouldn't,\" he wrote on LinkedIn in 2025. Using buy now, pay later plans for rent could be a \"slippery slope\" that has consumers \"falling into traps of fiscal irresponsibility,\" he says.Outside of temporary hardships or broader socio-economic conditions, \"we have to get down to those fundamentals and put yourself in a position to afford your lifestyle,\" Boneparth says.Affirm's spokesperson said the new offer will be \"a transparent option that offers flexibility for renters to align expenses with their paychecks.\" They added, \"We underwrite every application individually and we only approve people for what we believe they can responsibly afford to repay.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 taxis at Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from Boston on September 1, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSpirit Airlines is in talks with alternative investment firm Castlelake for a potential takeover as the discount airline looks for a path out of bankruptcy, CNBC has learned.Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August for the second time in a year after its previous turnaround plan fell flat. Fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines had been in talks with Spirit over the years for a potential merger, including in recent months, but didn't secure a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about the discussions. The two had reached a deal four years ago but it was called off after a surprise all-cash offer from JetBlue Airways.\"We don't comment on market rumors and speculation,\" a Spirit spokesman said. Castlelake didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear if Spirit's bondholders and Castlelake would reach a deal or what form it could take. Minneapolis-based Castlelake has been active for years in aviation finance. In August, it announced it was launching a new aviation lending arm, Merit AirFinance, with $1.8 billion in deployable capital. Spirit in mid-December said it amended its agreement with creditors to receive another $50 million in funding immediately, a lifeline for the carrier. Additional funding would be contingent on \"further progress on a standalone plan of reorganization or a strategic transaction,\" Spirit said Dec. 15. \"Spirit is currently in active negotiations on each of these possibilities,\" the company added.In its fight for survival, Spirit has slashed flights, reduced its fleet and cut jobs to save money. Unions last year agreed to pay cuts for the carrier's pilots and flight attendants. That amounted to $100 million in concessions, the Air Line Pilots Association said in a Jan. 13 open letter, urging bondholders to support Spirit's restructuring and avoid a liquidation.Dania Beach, Florida-based Spirit for years enjoyed largely steady profitability and enviable margins in the often-rocky airline industry. But things took a turn after the pandemic, when wages and other costs soared, customer preferences changed, and an oversupply of domestic flights drove down airfare. That was especially punishing for U.S.-focused carriers that don't enjoy a buffer from plush first-class cabins and large credit card and loyalty program deals.The carrier's problems snowballed after a Pratt & Whitney engine recall grounded dozens of its Airbus aircraft starting in 2023 and the planned acquisition by JetBlue was blocked two years ago by a federal judge who ruled it was anticompetitive, leaving both carriers to fend for themselves against a backdrop where larger carriers dominate.Spirit has been trying in recent years to win over higher-spending customers by offering roomier seats or bundled fares that include seat assignments and baggage, or allow for changes, to better compete with larger rivals whose profits have been buoyed by big-spending customers post-pandemic.

    "body": "The EU needs \"clarity\" on Donald Trump's intentions after he cancelled his planned levies against eight countries over their stance on Greenland, a senior lawmaker has told CNBC.EU lawmakers have removed the threat of tariff countermeasures against the U.S. after the U.S. president backed down.Bernd Lange, a member of the European Parliament and chair of EU-US trade relations on its committee on International trade, said the bloc still needs \"greater clarity\" on Trump's intentions after he declared on Truth Social he had a \"framework\" of a deal between the White House and NATO late Wednesday. Trump later told CNBC he had \"the concept of a deal.\"\"First of all, nobody knows exactly what the details of this so-called solution or deal are. We have to look to the details,\" Lange told CNBC by phone on Thursday morning.\"The decision about such a solution or deal should be taken by Denmark and the people in Greenland, not between two important men,\" he said, referring to the discussions between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\"Let's see what the development will bring,\" he added.watch nowOn Wednesday, European lawmakers suspended approval of the trade pact agreed last July between the EU and U.S. after Trump unveiled plans last weekend to hit eight countries with fresh import levies.European leaders planned to discuss potential responses at an emergency summit in Brussels later on Thursday evening, including countermeasures on some 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of U.S. imports that would have taken effect next month.But after Trump canceled tariffs on eight European countries for opposing his bid to annex Greenland, saying he had \"the framework of a future deal\" over Greenland, tensions appear to have eased.Lange said the EU's countermeasures to tariffs were \"not off the table, but on hold.\"\"It's clear that this list of countermeasures, which is still legally there, is now not coming into force in February, because it seems that there will be no tariffs from the United States. So this will be put on hold as well... perhaps prolonged for some months,\" he said.Despite Trump's apparent climbdown, EU leaders are set to push ahead with their planned emergency summit later.Lange said: \"We will look to the assessment regarding this so-called Greenland solution, and secondly, we will contact our U.S. counterparts to get more clarity and security about respecting the deal on both sides.\"",

    "body": "People shop at a Costco store in the Staten Island borough of New York City, U.S., Jan. 16, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersInflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday.The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month both for headline and core, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.The monthly figures showed a 0.2% increase for both months. The BEA released the October and November numbers together due to impacts from the government shutdown during which official agencies suspended data collection and reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the report showed personal income up 0.1% in October and 0.3% in November, the latter 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. Also, personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer spending, rose 0.5% in both months, matching the November forecast.The personal savings rate rose in November to 3.5%, down 0.2 percentage point from the prior month.Price figures for November reflected 0.2% increases in both goods and services. Food was flat while energy-related costs rose 1.9% and after falling 0.7% in October.The report comes the same day that the BEA said gross domestic product rose 4.4% in the third quarter, according to the second and final estimate. In addition, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims are trending around their lowest level in two years.Together, the data indicates an economy continuing to expand, with consumer spending ahead of inflation despite a somewhat softening labor market.\"The consumer continues to drive the U.S economy, with today's data pointing to another strong gain in spending. This resilience comes in spite of last year's slowdown in the labor market, and still elevated inflation, both of which have weighed on real incomes,\" said James McCann, senior economist for investment strategy at Edward Jones. \"Today's data should reassure the Fed that the economy remains on a solid footing, despite a cooler labor market.\"Markets expect the Federal Reserve to stay on hold at its policy meeting next week following three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025. Futures traders see at most two rate reductions this year as policymakers weigh the impact of last year's easing, coupled with continued inflation pressures and an uncertain geopolitical landscape.watch now",

The Buick compact SUV that will be built in the U.S. will be sold domestically, meaning production of the vehicle in China may continue as well for sales elsewhere.The move comes as President Donald Trump has been pressuring companies to onshore production and as the relationship between the U.S. and China grows increasingly contentious, including with tariffs on vehicles. The Detroit automaker has produced the compact Buick Envision SUV in China for the U.S. since 2017. However, the company declined to confirm the name for the next generation of the vehicle that it will be moving stateside. \"General Motors will onshore production of the next-generation Buick compact SUV to Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, beginning in 2028. This decision further strengthens GM's domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs, building on $5.5 billion in new investments announced across our U.S. manufacturing sites in the last year,\" GM said in an emailed statement.The compact Buick is expected to join production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox at the Kansas factory following limited production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. Equinox production will start in 2027, GM said.U.S. sales of the Envision have topped 40,000 for the past three years, representing roughly a quarter of Buick's sales during that time period.GM's decision to produce the compact Buick SUV in the U.S. was first reported by Reuters.",

    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby-care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby-care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares with its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby-care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with reporters on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, P&G's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

A final vote is expected later Thursday afternoon.The four bills account for the largest chunk of government spending, about $1.2 trillion in total. They would fund the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; and Education. The bills represent the final quartet of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown on Jan. 30. If they pass, the Senate would still need to approve them before they head to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. The Senate does not return until next week. House lawmakers are widely expected to pass the bills on Thursday, with lawmakers desperate to avoid another shutdown after enduring a record 43-day shutdown last year. Despite bipartisan accord on avoiding another shutdown, some of the bills still face serious hurdles.

    "body": "Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen holds a press conference in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 22, 2026. Marko Djurica | ReutersGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a press conference Thursday he doesn't know what's in the \"framework\" deal that President Donald Trump announced after meeting with NATO's leader a day earlier.But Nielsen stressed that no deal involving Greenland can be struck without the island and its governing kingdom of Denmark having a say.And any such deal must respect Greenland's \"red lines\" — including its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.\"We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU. We choose NATO,\" Nielsen told the press in Nuuk. \"This is not only a situation for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark, it's about the world order for all of us.\"The remarks echoed Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's earlier statement maintaining that Greenland's sovereignty is non-negotiable.Nielsen's comments came one day after Trump — who has spent weeks aggressively pressuring Europe over a proposed U.S. takeover of Greenland — abruptly announced that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have forged the \"framework of a future deal.\"The announcement, delivered in a Truth Social post following a closed-door meeting in Davos, Switzerland, was light on details. In a CNBC interview, Trump called it the \"concept of a deal\" and said he would \"explain it down the line.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeBut the agreement was apparently enough for Trump to cancel the forthcoming tariffs he had slapped on eight European countries that had come to Greenland's defense amid the president's saber-rattling.Trump suggested to CNBC that the framework involves mineral rights for the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.Meanwhile, The New York Times reported Wednesday that some NATO officials had separately discussed a possible compromise in which the U.S. would get sovereignty over \"small pockets of Greenland for military bases.\"Nielsen on Thursday rejected that proposal out of hand, while repeatedly noting that he has not been told what the Trump-Rutte framework entails.\"I don't know what's concrete in that deal,\" he said. \"But I know that we have now a high-level working group working on a solution for both parties.\"\"We have some red lines\" that cannot be crossed, Nielsen said. \"We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty.\"\"Our integrity and our borders and international law is definitely, definitely a red line that we don't want anyone to cross,\" he added later in the presser. \"And I don't think that is strange at all.\"Nielsen said that he believes those red lines, which were recently relayed to Rutte from Danish and Greenlandic officials, have since \"been delivered\" to Trump.But there's been \"nothing about a deal on mineral resources or anything else,\" he said. Greenland is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on economics and other matters, \"but that's something we have to talk about in mutual respect,\" he added.Nielsen also directly criticized the Trump administration's aggression toward Greenland, including the recent flare-up in tensions that, until Wednesday, included the possibility of U.S. military action.\"No doubt, the rhetoric we have heard the last year is unacceptable for us,\" he said, adding that it is difficult to maintain a respectful dialogue when his citizens \"every night hear threats about acquiring and taking.\"\"Try to imagine how it is as Greenlanders, as people here, peaceful people in Greenland, hear and see in the media every day that somebody wants to take your freedom.\"",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle exits a charging lot on Jan. 15, 2026 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAlphabet's Waymo said Thursday that its robotaxi service is now open to paying riders in Miami, kicking off a 2026 market expansion.Miami is the sixth market where Waymo offers driverless ride-hailing service, extending its lead over Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox. As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S.To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the Google sister company said. The company began testing its vehicles in the Florida city in early 2025. Waymo said it plans to extend its service to the Miami International Airport in the near future, but did not give a specific timeline. The company said \"nearly 10,000 residents\" of Miami have already signed up to try its robotaxi service, and Waymo will be \"inviting new riders on a rolling basis.\" Riders can hail a Waymo robotaxi in Miami using the company's app. Waymo is partnering with mobility company Moove for fleet management services including vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs.The Miami launch comes after Waymo has faced public concerns over the safety and driving behavior of its vehicles.Waymo's vehicles contributed to gridlock during storms and widespread power outages in San Francisco last month. The company has been refining its systems to better navigate during such circumstances and weather, Waymo said afterward.The company ended 2025 with its robotaxi service available in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area.For 2026, Waymo has said it plans to expand to more U.S. markets, including Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington and Nashville, Tenn. The company is also testing in New York, Tokyo and London, and has also said it will launch its first overseas commercial service this year.In December, Waymo crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company said it had served 14 million trips in 2025. The company is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding, CNBC reported last month. The Alphabet company faces its most formidable competition from Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide in Asia, but Amazon's Zoox and Elon Musk's Tesla, along with startups like May Mobility and Nuro, are aiming to compete with Waymo in North America.— CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's job seemed safe from firing by President Donald Trump after Supreme Court justices skeptically questioned the Trump administration's lawyers on Wednesday about the grounds for Cook's would-be termination and its effect on the Fed's historical independence.Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned Solicitor General D. John Sauer about the effects of his argument that Trump could fire Cook or other Fed governors \"for cause\" — but without judicial review of whether that purported cause of alleged mortgage fraud was legitimate. \"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause — that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" said Kavanaugh, one of the court's six conservatives.Cook, who was in the courtroom Wednesday, sued Trump in September, challenging the president's claimed power to summarily remove her for uncharged allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.\"The real question is to what extent we believe the public is harmed to allow Ms. Cook to remain in post during the pendency of this case?\" asked Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, referring to Cook's lawsuit, which remains pending in a federal district court. Jackson is one of the court's three liberal members.Sauer replied, \"We assert grievous, irreparable injury to the public perception of the Federal Reserve of allowing [Cook] to stay in office.\"Jackson asked, \"Do you have evidence other than the president's view?\"Another conservative justice, Samuel Alito, expressed skepticism about how quickly Cook had been fired by Trump after an allegation against Cook was publicly made by one of his appointees\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody, by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit [Court of Appeals] in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked.\"When this was before the executive branch, it was handled in a very cursory manner,\" said Alito, who normally sides with the Trump administration on key legal issues.Paul Clement, who represented Cook at the hearing, leaned in during his arguments on words that the Supreme Court in an opinion last year used to describe the Fed as distinct from other federal agencies whose officials might be removed by a president.The court had called the Fed a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"\"There's no rational reason to go through all the trouble of creating this unique, quasi-private entity that is exempt from everything from the appropriations process to the civil service laws, just to give it a removal restriction that is as toothless as the president imagines,\" Clement said.\"But if that removal restriction has real, substantive, and procedural bite, then this emergency application should be denied,\" Clement said, referring to the Trump administration's request that the Supreme Court allow Cook to be removed for now.At stake is not only the fate of Cook — who denies any wrongdoing — but potentially the Fed's future independence to set monetary policy without the risk of a president being able to easily remove a governor who fails to do their bidding on that issue.Underscoring those stakes is the recent disclosure by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that he is the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., in connection with his oversight of a multibillion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters there.Powell, who attended the arguments, has said the real reason for that probe is the Fed holding interest rates steady for much of last year to Trump's ire.Cook was one of the Fed governors who backed Powell in maintaining those rates.\"This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure,\" Cook said in a statement after the hearing.\"Research and experience show that Federal Reserve independence is essential to fulfilling the congressional mandate of price stability and maximum employment,\" she said. \"That is why Congress chose to insulate the Federal Reserve from political threats, while holding it accountable for delivering on that mandate.\"Lisa Cook, governor of the US Federal Reserve, and U.S. President Donald Trump.Ting Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images | Jonathan Ernst | ReutersWhen Trump moved to fire Cook in late August — the first time a president had ever attempted such a move — there was immediate speculation it was due to her refusal to agree to cut interest rates as Trump wanted.If Cook and Powell were to be removed from the Fed's seven-member board, Trump would be in a position to appoint a majority of that board — and, theoretically at the least, have more influence over interest rate decisions.Trump did not cite Cook's stance on interest rates when he said he was firing her.Instead, the president cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that she had made false statements in applying for home mortgages, which predated her appointment to the Fed by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 to fill an unexpired board term. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term.Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can terminate a Fed board member, and a governor like Cook can only be terminated \"for cause.\"The law does not detail what would constitute \"cause,\" but cause has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.After Cook sued Trump to block her removal from the Fed, a federal district court judge in Washington ruled that she could remain with the central bank pending the outcome of her lawsuit.Judge Jia Cobb, in that ruling, wrote that \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"Cobb said that \"best reading\" of that provision is that the alleged cause for removal relates to a governor's actions while \"in office.\"The allegations against Cook relate to actions she took before joining the Fed.The Department of Justice appealed Cobb's ruling, but was unsuccessful. The DOJ then asked the Supreme Court to take the case.In a filing, the DOJ said that the \"determination of cause\" for termination is subject to \"the unreviewable discretion of the President.\"\"In any case, the President has identified sufficient cause here,\" the filing says.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Bernanke was at Wednesday's hearing.The brief says that Congress \"intentionally\" designed the Fed \"as a uniquely independent entity, largely insulated from political pressures that could otherwise prioritize short-term economic gain over long-term stability and growth.\"\"Granting the government's request to remove Governor Cook from the Board immediately would upset these longstanding protections and the essential functions they serve,\" the brief says. \"Doing so would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\"",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowNear expansive aisles of home improvement supplies, some of Lowe's tiniest shoppers worked this Saturday on do-it-yourself projects of their own.The children, some as young as 3, sported miniature versions of the retailer's signature red aprons while hammering together washing machine-themed piggy banks at the retailer's kids' workshop at the company's store in North Bergen, New Jersey.Lowe's is trying to attract a younger audience — though it hasn't suddenly found an untapped market for home improvement spending from preschoolers. When the retailer this month relaunched its Kids Club program and began handing out lollipops to children who visit its stores, it was really a step in a strategy to win more business from younger parents, especially those who aren't yet homeowners.It's not just young parents, though. Lowe's wants to reel in new shoppers from the Gen Z and millennial generations, which are buying homes later than their parents did. Other moves to win over the cohorts include adding a wider array of merchandise through its third-party marketplace and tapping into a network of influencers on social media.The company wants to attract more frequent store and website visits as the U.S. housing market remains sluggish, consumers put off homebuying until later in life and higher prices of everyday expenses cause more people to postpone big purchases and projects like kitchen renovations. It is adding some of the features through My Lowe's Rewards, a customer loyalty program for DIY shoppers, which the company launched two years ago and which has grown to over 30 million members. \"What we've been challenged with from a marketing perspective and a total brand perspective is how to drive relevancy among consumers who aren't in the homeowner category or who desire to be in the homeowner category, but aren't financially able to do that,\" Lowe's Chief Marketing Officer Jen Wilson said.Lowe's relaunched its Kids Club, a free workshop where children can tackle their own do-it-yourself projects. The workshop was recently held at its store in Matthews, North Carolina.Courtesy of Lowe'sShe said that has encouraged the home improvement retailer to think about \"driving relevancy in new ways,\" including adding more events and seeking out surprising or buzzy merchandise that may catch the attention of a potential shopper on TikTok.That's where kids fit in, too. She said one of Lowe's surprising findings from market research was the strong influence of children in shaping where their parents choose to shop, especially for millennial parents.Home Depot and Lowe's storesGetty ImagesPutting off projectsAs home prices and borrowing costs have risen, more Americans have postponed homeownership, a life stage that tends to nudge people toward springing for purchases of paint or hardware, or hiring home improvement professionals like electricians or plumbers. The median age of a first-time homebuyer is now 40 years old, an all-time high, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home improvement sales have dropped off since the years of the Covid pandemic. Lowe's expects its total sales to be $86 billion this year. That would represent an increase from $83.7 billion a year ago, but it would be lower than each of the four years before that. Lowe's also expects comparable sales, an industry metric that excludes one-time factors like store openings and closures, to be flat compared to a year ago. Compared to its rival Home Depot, Lowe's relies more heavily on DIY shoppers. About 70% of its sales come from those consumers, with the remainder from home professionals like contractors, roofers and electricians that homeowners typically hire, according to the company.Home Depot, on the other hand, has historically drawn about half of its sales from home pros and half from DIY shoppers.Executives from both Lowe's and Home Depot have said they have seen lower demand for big-ticket items and pricier projects, which they have chalked up to slower housing turnover and economic uncertainty. Housing turnover typically encourages projects, as homeowners spruce up their homes before a sale or fix it up when moving in. In the meantime, both companies have focused on drawing more pros, which tend to be bigger and more reliable spenders. Home Depot in 2024 acquired SRS Distribution, a Texas-based company that sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses, in the largest acquisition in its history at $18.25 billion. It's bought other companies, too, including building-products distributor GMS last year. Lowe's made two of its own pro-focused acquisitions last year. It bought Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, insulation and other interior building products for large residential and commercial professionals, and Artisan Design Group, which provides design services and installation of flooring, cabinets and countertops for homebuilders and property managers.In the coming year, however, Lowe's larger reliance on do-it-yourself shoppers may give the company an edge, said Chuck Grom, a retail analyst for Gordon Haskett Equity Research. He upgraded the company's stock earlier this month from a hold to a buy rating because of signs of an improving housing backdrop.While the housing market is still challenged, furniture sales have picked up in recent quarters and more consumers appear to be getting used to higher borrowing costs as the \"new normal,\" Grom said. About 35% of consumers said in the equity research firm's most recent quarterly survey that they would be willing to buy a home at a 5.5% to 6% mortgage rate. That's up from about 25% in the third-quarter survey.The average 30-year mortgage rate has dipped slightly in recent months and was around 6.2% last week.Those are promising signs that consumers may dip their toes back into more DIY projects, even if recovery is gradual, he said.Shares of Lowe's have reflected some optimism about the coming year. Its stock has lagged the S&P 500's performance over the past year and last five years, but its stock is up about 22% in the past six months. That's compared to Home Depot, which has seen shares rise about 4% during the same period.Starting this month, Lowe's is handing out lollipops at stores in the hopes of drawing in more parents and families.Courtesy of Lowe'sLowe's leans youngerOne of the key goals of Lowe's strategy is giving customers more reasons to engage with its app or website, or make visits to stores part of their routine, even between DIY projects.Amanda Bailey, vice president of customer marketing and loyalty at Lowe's, said the company hopes free lollipops, for example, get kids to nudge their parents to stop by a store where they may purchase a few items or give parents a longer time to linger in peace when comparing appliances in the aisles.Lowe's is also trying to give shoppers more reasons to join or use its loyalty program. Customers must now sign up for the free monthly Kids Club workshop through the program, and children can collect digital badges on their parents' loyalty account for completing the projects. Customers can rack up points from purchases that become MyLowe's money, an incentive intended to get consumers to buy everyday items like household cleaning products or lightbulbs at the retailer.And Lowe's plans to expand kids' workshops, which cater to 3- to 10-year-olds, and add more complex projects for older children and teenagers, she said.It has also tested other free events for loyalty program members at select stores, including soccer clinics for kids, a ladies' night out with do-it-yourself projects like terrarium building and a family night out with games and hands-on activities.\"Traditionally, loyalty programs have been around rewarding the transaction,\" said Bailey, who previously worked to drive loyalty at brands including Hilton and Tory Burch. \"And so now we think about, how can we engage with customers in different phases of their life, in different moments of their life?\"Children participate in the Lowe's Kids Club at the retailer's store in Matthews, North Carolina.Courtesy of Lowe'sAlong with its typical home improvement items, Lowe's is trying to debut products that surprise customers or go viral on social media. Lowe's merchandising and marketing teams have started plotting out a 12-month plan of items that the company bets could become trending products, with about three to five items debuting each quarter, Wilson said. Loyalty program members get early or exclusive access to purchase some products, Wilson said.One of Lowe's first drops was its branded minibucket, which recently came out in light pink. Its mini-Kobalt toolbox kit, which comes in different colors, also gained traction on social media with customers using them to organize their makeup or store school supplies. Lowe's has other items in the works that it hopes will create buzz. These include a scented candle and tote bag that will drop in the spring, Lowe's busiest sales season, and a pet-themed Advent calendar for the holidays. \"These are impulse buys that are affordable and are great ways to introduce our brands to consumers who wouldn't otherwise be thinking about us,\" Wilson said.Lowe's also launched a creator network in June to encourage more influencers to post their do-it-yourself projects or purchases. It also partnered with well-known social media creator MrBeast, who has a storefront on the retailer's website where customers can shop his favorite items. And its marketplace, which launched in late 2024, has been a way to add more brands and expand categories.Gordon Haskett's Grom said company initiatives to gain customer loyalty, especially among younger shoppers, are important, but \"are not going to move the needle right away.\"\"They are trying to control what they can control,\" he said. \"The winds of the housing turnover are hard right now for them.\"Home Depot has also made moves of its own to attract customers, including launching a new platform for creators late last year and creating a new hub on its website with advice and ideas for new homeowners. It has also sped up customer deliveries. Over half of its deliveries are now same-day or next-day, more than triple the number in 2022, the company said at its investor day in December. And it also offers free kids' workshops at its stores. Yet as the home improvement retailers try to win a limited pool of business, they're also competing with independent and specialty home improvement shops, privately held Ace Hardware and retail giants like Walmart and Amazon, which carry some of the same merchandise. Though they may not yield immediate dividends, events will play a role in that competition moving forward. For families who came to Lowe's kids' workshop at the North Bergen store on Saturday, the activity was a  welcome way to spend a snowy day and get their kids to work with their hands. Ivette Crisostomo, a mom from Fort Lee, New Jersey, brought her 3-year-old son, Kai, to the workshop. She coordinated with two friends, who also brought their kids. \"This is like a set playdate for everyone,\" she said. \"It builds his confidence, too.\"As the event wrapped, it illustrated the goal of Lowe's strategy. Many parents browsed the aisles after finishing the project. Crisostomo said she sometimes winds up shopping, too. \"My eyes wander and if I do need something, I'll come to Lowe's,\" she said.",

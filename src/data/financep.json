    "body": "watch nowFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday condemned an investigation into her successor, Jerome Powell, saying it compromises the central bank's independence.Yellen, who served as Treasury secretary after leaving the Fed, added that she thinks financial markets should be more concerned about a situation that she called \"extremely chilling.\"\"I'm surprised the market isn't more concerned. It seems to me that the market should be concerned,\" Yellen said, according to CNBC's Sara Eisen.The comments come the day after Powell confirmed he'd been made aware that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., is looking into whether the central bank leader lied during testimony he provided to Congress last June about an expensive renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. The office is led by Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidante and former Fox News host. The Justice Department has not officially confirmed the investigation into what would be perjury charges.Yellen bristled at the notion that Powell might have lied.\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" she said.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks with CNBC from the New York Federal Reserve on Sept. 26th, 2024.David A. Grogan | CNBCYellen served during the first year of Trump's initial term as president but was replaced the following year by Powell after her term ended. She went on to serve under former President Joe Biden as the head of the Treasury, the first woman to hold either position.During her time at the Treasury, critics charged Yellen used the levers of debt issuance to underwrite a ballooning national debt. Trump has badgered the Fed to lower rates, in part to ease financing costs for a debt burden currently at $38.4 trillion.Yellen said using the Fed's key overnight borrowing rate to manage the debt is irresponsible.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt,\" Yellen said, adding she \"completely [disagrees] with that. It is the road to a banana republic.\"Other former Fed and Treasury officials joined the chorus against the Powell investigation.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the officials said in a statement. Signatories included former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson, and a number of prominent economists.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly. It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement said.",

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance is suing Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav as its latest step in a hostile pursuit to acquire WBD, CEO David Ellison outlined in a letter to WBD shareholders on Monday. The lawsuit asks a Delaware court to direct Warner Bros. Discovery to provide information about its sale process and pending deal with Netflix. \"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison said in the letter on Monday. \"We filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer,\" Ellison said. Ellison also informed WBD shareholders on Monday that Paramount intends to nominate directors for election to WBD's board at the company's 2026 annual meeting, in a move that would add a proxy fight to the equation. Paramount's latest escalation comes days after WBD's board once again recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's amended offer, which was made in late December. The company has repeatedly said its offer is superior to the company's deal with Netflix and has previously argued that the sale process was unfairly skewed. A WBD spokesman didn't immediately respond to request for comment Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery last month agreed to sell its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. The proposed deal was the result of a sale process in which Paramount was bidding for all of WBD's assets, including its portfolio of cable TV channels, known as Discovery Global. As part of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery plans to separate Discovery Global into its own publicly traded entity. Soon after WBD reached a deal with Netflix, Paramount went public with its hostile bid. Paramount has offered $30 per share, all cash for all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets. WBD's board told shareholders in December to reject the initial offer in favor of the Netflix deal, citing concerns about the backing of Ellison's father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Paramount responded with an amended offer in which the Oracle co-founder agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. Paramount has stopped short of increasing the size of its bid, however. The newly merged Paramount Skydance first took interest in Warner Bros. Discovery in the fall, making three unsolicited offers that were each rejected. Warner Bros. Discovery then opened up a sale process seeking offers for some or all of its company. At the same time, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would carry on with a plan that was announced earlier in the year to split its company into two publicly traded entities — Warner Bros., consisting of the streaming platform HBO Max and film studio, and Discovery Global, comprised of the pay TV networks like TNT and CNN.

    "body": "Tech investors are sounding out how the U.S. taking Greenland would affect the viability of critical and rare earth minerals mining there, CNBC has learned, as Washington ramps up its pursuit of the Arctic island.Greenland has found itself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm over the past week as the U.S. has threatened to annex the self-governing Danish territory, citing national security concerns. Commercial opportunities have also come into the spotlight.In the past week, Critical Metals Corp, a company with a mining project in development on the Arctic island, has fielded questions from tech investors about how the U.S. acquiring Greenland would impact that asset and its development strategy, CEO Tony Sage told CNBC. The NASDAQ-listed company's stock is up 116% since the start of 2026.The project is in the early stages of building a plant to extract heavy rare earth elements (HREE), which can be used to provide heat resistance and magnetic stability in advanced technology ranging from EVs to AI data center infrastructure.Sage said U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Greenland had generated additional \"buzz\" for the project from investors. Without naming specific shareholders, he said Critical Metals Corp backers included those who invest in Magnificent Seven U.S. tech companies.Last week, the CEO of Amaroq, a mining company with projects in Greenland, told CNBC it was having discussions with U.S. government bodies about potential investment opportunities in the territory.The White House has said it's \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland, though it hasn't ruled out military action to acquire the territory, ahead of planned talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials. Mining in GreenlandInterest in critical minerals and rare earth mining in Greenland from tech investors has picked up in the past year. In January 2025, Trump reasserted his desire to acquire the territory — a massive, strategically-placed island with a population of just 57,000 — ahead of taking office.Amaroq chief Eldur Ólafsson said the company had seen an increase in attention from investors, including tech investors, over the last 12 months, in an interview with CNBC last week, as geopolitical tensions brought supply chains for critical minerals into focus.In November, the company said that \"commercial levels\" of germanium and gallium, critical minerals that are crucial for building advanced AI chips, were present in a mining project it owns in Greenland. \"When Trump put tariffs on China, the first two metals China stopped exporting were germanium and gallium,\" Ólafsson told CNBC. \"Why? Because you need it in AI, you need it in defense, you need it in tech, it's absolutely critical.\"watch nowChina's export ban on several rare earth minerals in 2025 highlighted to tech investors the challenge of the country's dominance in the space, said Critical Metals Corp's Sage. \"The heavy rare earths, which include Yttrium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium, and Gallium are the minerals that generate the most interest,\" he told CNBC. \"These are the materials that are essential for defence technologies, robotics, semiconductors and aerospace applications. We can't fly rockets into space, build nuclear submarines or next-generation fighter jets without these materials.\"Sage added that Critical Metals Corp had \"strong relationships\" with the governments of both Greenland and the U.S. and did not expect its plans to change.The company's stock surged 62% in a day in October after Reuters reported the U.S. Government was considering buying a stake. It shed the gains to finish 2025 up 2% for the year.Others are more skeptical about whether Greenland's critical and rare earth minerals can significantly reduce the West's dependence on China, which produced 70% of rare earths in 2024, according to Statista. \"Getting rare earths from exploration to the mighty magnet involves five to six distinct stages — and right now, what's in Greenland is still only in the exploration stage,\" Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director at industry group the Critical Minerals Institute, told CNBC.\"Rare earths in Greenland won't materially move markets in the next decade,\" she added.",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly on Monday sued the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alleging the Trump administration's efforts to punish the Arizona Democrat for his participation in a video to U.S. troops violate the Constitution.The federal civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was filed one week after Hegseth said his department would cut Kelly's military retirement pay in response to the video.The government's actions \"trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence,\" Kelly's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, which was also filed against the U.S. Navy Department and its secretary, John Phelan.\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" the lawyers wrote.The legal complaint alleges that the defendants violated Kelly's right to freedom of speech, as well as his protection under the Constitution's \"Speech or Debate Clause,\" which prevents executive action against members of Congress for their legislative conduct. The suit also alleges infringements of Kelly's due process rights and the separation of powers, among other violations.The video at the center of the fight featured Kelly and five other congressional Democrats delivering a message addressed to U.S. troops and members of the intelligence community.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly said in the 90-second video, which was first posted on social media on Nov. 18.It was shared as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs.Members of Congress, including some Republicans, had questioned the legality of those deadly strikes, which were made without congressional authorization. The attacks have continued, killing 123 people since early September, according to The New York Times.The other lawmakers in the video, who all served in the military or in U.S. intelligence, each made a similar statement about troops being allowed to refuse unlawful orders.But Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, is the only one who formally retired from service, and therefore remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Days later, Hegseth slammed the video as \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" while labeling its participants the \"Seditious Six.\" Around the same time, the Pentagon said it would investigate \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, and warned that the senator may be recalled to active duty \"for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"President Donald Trump had reposted scathing criticism of the Democrats, at one point accusing them of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Kelly at the time said he would not be \"silenced by bullies.\"On Jan. 5, Hegseth said the Pentagon is taking \"administrative action\" against Kelly by reducing his retired rank, which would trigger a \"corresponding reduction in retired pay.\"Hegseth also said he had issued a formal letter of censure. Kelly, in response, vowed to \"fight this with everything I've got.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageSen. Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from members of the media during a meeting with oil and gas executives in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 9, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that aims to block the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.The executive order states that the revenue, which is held in foreign government deposit funds, are \"held solely for sovereign purposes\" and that any court attempt to seize the funds will \"materially harm the national security and foreign policy\" of the U.S. The order, which declared a national emergency, said the funds are the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic means, and are not assets subject to private claims. Any use of judicial process against the funds will interfere with efforts to \"ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the order says.Trump signed the order nearly one week after U.S. military forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas. Both were indicted on drug-trafficking charges and have pleaded not guilty. Since the military operation, Trump has said that both nations \"are working well together\" on rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure and that American oil giants will invest at least $100 billion in the South American country.Trump met with major oil industry executives on Friday afternoon in an effort to get U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. In that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that right now Venezuela is \"uninvestable.\"ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil exited Venezuela after its government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized the country's oil sector along with several other key industries. Both companies have filed arbitration cases against Venezuela seeking billions of dollars in compensation for assets that were expropriated by the government.Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Trump administration.In his Friday order, Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as legal justification for safeguarding Venezuelan oil revenue in U.S. accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",

    "body": "Job scams, thousands of applicants, getting ghosted by recruiters (if you hear from them at all): There are endless and completely valid reasons why people are tired of applying to jobs online.But like it or not, it's still the No. 1 way to land a job interview and offer, according to new Glassdoor data.Online applications accounted for 60% of all job offers reported on Glassdoor in 2025 and accounted for twice as many interviews and 1.5 times as many offers than other sources, including referrals, being recruited and other methods.But they're also losing their edge: That share is down from a high in 2023 when cold applications led to 73% of all job offers.Meanwhile, the share of people being recruited into roles is climbing. The proportion of recruiter-sourced candidates increased 72% since 2023 to nearly 15% last year, per Glassdoor data.And though fewer people are being referred into new roles, those who choose this job-searching route have a higher rate of success: Interviews stemming from a referral were 35% more likely to result in a job offer than those starting with an online application, and referrals made up about 10% of job offers between July 2024 and July 2025.Cold applying could have even less of a pull in 2026, says HR and recruiting expert J.T. O'Donnell.\"I think you're going to just see a huge shift away from public job posting because it's become so broken\" with people mass applying and overwhelming recruiters, O'Donnell tells CNBC Make It. She predicts the upcoming year's data will involve \"fewer people getting jobs from applying online, and a lot more being contacted proactively by recruiters, because we're seeing a very big switch into quiet hiring this year.\"Here are her best tips for striking the right job opportunities no matter which route you take.Get recruiters to notice youActive recruitment into roles could see a boost thanks to new AI tools that make it easier for hiring teams to \"control the candidate flow\" and \"surface candidates that they've never been able to surface before,\" O'Donnell says.So how do you get on a recruiter's radar? Build out your personal brand online, she says.Choose an online social platform and be consistent when talking about your work, perspective and skills. \"If a recruiter wants to find you, they need to know that you have industry experience and you have skill set experience,\" she says.If you're using LinkedIn, O'Donnell says she's found that five types of content formats do well:Industry observations: What's going on in the news of your field?Hot takes: Do you have a contrarian view of what's happening in your industry?Then vs. now: How has your work changed over time, say, in the last five years?Listicles: Can you break down your thoughts, your process or your learnings on a subject in few key takeaways?Storytelling: Talk a bit about yourself as an employee. For example, can you answer a behavioral question often asked in job interviews, like how you problem-solved a difficult situation at work?\"You are literally creating a space where recruiters can find you and contact you, and that's how you start getting interviews in this market,\" O'Donnell says.Ask for the right referralsWhether you're approaching people for informational interviews or want a referral to a specific opening at their company, \"think carefully about who you're asking to introduce you,\" O'Donnell says. People might be more willing to refer you to roles that aren't in their own department she says, especially as people are worried about their own security and job hugging.Research has also shown that \"weak ties,\" like friends of friends, are more likely than direct contacts to help you land a new job.As for how to ask for a referral, \"give them the valid business reasons why you're impressed by the company and that you're looking to earn an interview,\" O'Donnell says. Be specific in explaining why you want the job, why you're qualified and why you're hoping they'll introduce you.Best tips for cold applying onlineO'Donnell's No. 1 tip for applying to a job online is to be first. Set alerts for your target job titles, functions and companies to be within the first 20 to 40 people to apply, she says.If you see a job being reposted, consider the window to apply closed, she says. This often happens because a company has paid the platform to repost an opening in advance based on their contract, not because the role is actually vacant and being hired for. \"It's very likely it just got reposted automatically, or if they did, they've already made the decision on you, and you can't go back and apply again,\" O'Donnell says.Otherwise, in addition to being first, make sure your application is complete. Plenty of people rush to fill out job forms without being thorough and accurate, which can \"easily get you disqualified,\" O'Donnell says.Finally, make sure your online presence, like your LinkedIn profile or professional website, is up to date. As recruiters deal with spam applicants and fake resumes on their side, they're using your online footprint to prove you're real, credible and actually a fit for the role, she says.Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "watch nowBank executives were sent scrambling over the weekend after President Donald Trump declared late Friday that American credit card companies would be subject to a 10% cap on the interest rate they can charge customers.The move sent shares of large banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America down between 1% and 4% in early trading Monday. Companies more tightly tethered to the card industry, like Visa, Mastercard and American Express, also fell. Capital One, whose loan book is mostly from credit cards, sank nearly 7%.Trump proposed a one-year cap on interest rates starting Jan. 20. While it's unclear exactly how that would be enforced, the industry's message is clear: the plan would bring unintended consequences for consumers and the American economy.The move would make large swaths of the credit card industry unprofitable, especially tied to customers with less-than-ideal credit profiles, according to banks and analysts. The average credit card rate nationally is 19.7% as of this month, according to a weekly survey from Bankrate.com, while rates for subprime borrowers and store-specific cards are even higher.Rather than offer loss-making products to consumers, the industry would simply stop offering access to customers with subprime credit, along with a slew of other changes around card programs including scaling back rewards, insiders say. Consumers would either spend less or rely on other forms of unsecured debt, many of which carry even higher interest rates than credit cards, they say.\"We cannot offer products at a loss; there's no scenario where we would take our entire portfolio to 10%,\" said a person with knowledge of the operations of a large bank, who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly. \"It's not a stretch to suggest this will very quickly tank the economy.\"The drag on the economy from less spending could be more acute for airlines, retailers and restaurants, which would have to make up for lost card revenues by \"potentially raising pricing\" on their services, KBW analysts led by Sanjay Sakhrani and Chris McGratty said in a Jan. 11 research note.The industry's trade groups issued a joint statement late Friday making their case.\"Evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the trade groups said.(L-R) Wells Fargo CEO and President Charles Scharf, Brian Bank of America Chairman and CEO Thomas Moynihan, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, State Street CEO Ronald OÕHanley, BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, testify during a Wall Street oversight hearing by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, December 6, 2023.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images'Opening bid?'This isn't the industry's first time contending with possible price controls. A bill was introduced last year from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years.While that bill is stalled in Congress, a study released Monday on possible impacts from the Electronic Payments Coalition found that a 10% cap on rates would mean that card issuers would close accounts for nearly 90% of current users, or 175 million Americans. Most accounts with credit scores below 740 would be shut, the study claimed.Complicating matters, it is unclear to bankers how Trump's rate cap would take place.The most straightforward approach, through legislation in Congress, isn't possible by the proposed Jan. 20 start date, said Tobin Marcus, head of U.S. policy at Wolfe Research.Other enforcement means, through banking regulators including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, are also possible. But the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to shutter that agency, and the industry has had a successful run at defeating CFPB rules in federal courts. \"I'm not aware of an authority that they can use to do this unilaterally in any kind of a sweeping way,\" Marcus said. \"As far as I can tell, telling them they have until Jan. 20 is an attempt to create pressure and have them do it voluntarily.\"While the exact mechanism that Trump can use to enforce an interest rate cap is unclear, card issuers now face the risk that rates could be headed lower in some form of negotiated compromise with the government, KBW's McGratty said in an interview.\"Is 10% an opening bid?\" he said. \"There's a long distance between 10% and what companies charge today.\"Americans had a collective $1.23 trillion in credit card debt as of the third quarter last year, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Balances have been climbing as many Americans spent down the savings they'd built up during the global coronavirus pandemic.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Capital One.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on December 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump will face an important obstacle — from within his own party — as he seeks to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Sunday he will block any Trump appointees to the central bank, including for the new chair, in light of revelations over the weekend that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential perjury charges.\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" he added.That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate.Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the \"one big beautiful bill\" spending package last year. Tillis is retiring from the Senate when his term ends.Powell's position isn't the only one at stake.Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed.\"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said.Tillis isn't the only banking panel member to criticize Trump over the move.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell \"a dangerous man\" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a \"sock puppet\" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" Warren said in a statement.While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he can stay on as governor until 2028. He has not indicated yet whether he will do so.The White House has been conducting an extensive search for the new chair, with the candidate field whittled down to five. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.",

    "body": "watch nowJersey Mike's Subs is taking its signature sandwiches overseas with its first European expansion set for this year, the company said Monday. Leading the push is the brand's founder and board chair, Peter Cancro, via his company, JM Submarines UK LTD.The deal between Jersey Mike's and Cancro's entity calls for 400 stores to be opened in the U.K. and Ireland, and it will be the first in a series of plans for future international growth. The privately owned Jersey Mike's was acquired for a reported $8 billion by Blackstone in late 2024. \"All consumers, not only here in the U.S. but around the world, are looking for a great value, but they want quality. They want authenticity,\" Jersey Mike's CEO Charlie Morrison told CNBC in an interview. \"Everything about the brand screams quality and freshness, and I think that's what consumers want anywhere in the world. They're going to be picky and careful about what they choose, but we believe strongly they're going to choose Jersey Mike's over anybody else.\"Morrison noted that deli style subs are becoming a staple internationally, and he plans to stay true to the brand's roots in this expansion. He said Jersey Mike's 20 consecutive years of positive same-store sales growth in the U.S. to help inform the international move. A Jersey Mike's restaurant in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAt Wingstop, where Morrison served as CEO until 2022, the brand pushed heavily into international markets and was a pandemic winner in both stock performance and sales.\"I've learned that in my past, that consumers around the world really prefer that you bring them ... that which got the brand to where it is today,\" Morrison said.Cancro founded Jersey Mike's in 1975 after purchasing the first Mike's Subs store in Point Pleasant, N.J., He led the brand as CEO for nearly 50 years, until Morrison took over in April 2025. He said diners might see different toppings or sauces overseas than they do in the U.S., but the product will ring true to what is served in the sates.\"We see it as a great sandwich market,\" Cancro said of Europe. \"[There are] a lot of players in the marketplace, and we see a tremendous opportunity.\"The U.S. consumer is increasingly value-conscious, but Jersey Mike's believes it can still win over diners in that environment, Morrison said.\"Certainly, we've seen some challenges at the lower end across the industry, but again, at Jersey Mike's, it's a craveable product. It's one that's going to be a staple for consumers for a long time to come,\" he said.",

Economists such as Glenn Hubbard, Kenneth Rogoff and Jared Bernstein also signed on.Powell on Sunday confirmed that he'd been notified from the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., that he is the subject of a probe into statements he made to Congress last June. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell answered questions regarding the massive renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in the nation's capital.At the time, President Donald Trump and other officials used cost overruns to intensify their criticism of Powell. Trump threatened to fire the Fed chair but backed off. It's not clear that the president would have the authority to remove Powell, with an unrelated case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook set for a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court next week that also addresses the president's power over the central bank.\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the statement said.Jonathan Kantner, former assistant U.S. attorney general, told CNBC on Monday that the bar for convicting someone in cases like these is \"very high\" particularly if there's a sense that the prosecution is politically motivated. Trump has been a longtime critic of Powell as he has pushed the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank approved three reductions in 2025.In a statement Sunday, Powell alleged that the accusations are a pretext to remove him from office. If that is established, it would \"set into motion a whole bunch of other legal disputes,\" Kantner said. \"This could get quite messy.\"CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.Correction: Jonathan Kantner is a former assistant U.S. attorney general.

You know we have so many that want it. I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,\" Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday. \"They're playing too cute,\" he added. His comments come shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Exxon were down less than 1% in morning trading Monday.Speaking alongside several other American oil executives on Friday, Woods said Exxon would need to see \"some pretty significant changes\" if it was to reenter the country for a third time.

Erik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBanks and financial services stocks slid Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump called for a 10%, one-year cap on credit card interest rates. Capital One shares dropped 6% in midday trading and Synchrony Financial tumbled more than 8%. Credit cards account for a large share of both banks' business models. Other banks that are more diversified saw smaller losses.

Other financial services names were caught in the downdraft. American Express slumped 4%, while Wells Fargo declined about 2%. The proposed cap would come into force on Jan. 20, according to a post on Truth Social on Friday, though Trump didn't provide details on how it would work. \"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote, echoing a pledge he made in the 2024 presidential campaign. \"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" he added.A cap would require approval from Congress. There has long been interest in curbing fees, and bipartisan bills to cap credit card interest rates at 10% have previously been introduced, highlighting potential appetite for the move.When asked about his post, Trump said Sunday to reporters that if banks don't limit rates they would be \"in violation of the law.\"Critics said over the weekend that Trump's plan, if enacted, would cause banks to pull back on lending, causing many consumers to lose access to credit and dampening personal spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of all economic activity.Bank industry insiders say the White House proposal would have unintended consequences for consumers and the American economy.The move would make large swaths of the credit card industry unprofitable, especially tied to customers with less-than-ideal credit profiles, according to banks and analysts. Rather than offer unprofitable products to consumers, the industry would simply stop offering access to customers with subprime credit, and make other changes in card programs, including scaling back rewards, insiders say.Consumers would either spend less or rely on other forms of unsecured debt, they say.Buy-now-pay-later stocks were higher in early trading on the notion more consumers would be forced to use those lenders if banks pulled back on extending credit, but soon gave back those gains after the market formally opened.Affirm Holdings slid more than 6% after rallying in premarket trading, and PayPal fell about 1%.— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting ",

    "body": "U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) walks after the Senate passes U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping spending and tax bill, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 1, 2025. Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersRepublican protests are growing louder on Capitol Hill as the Trump administration's Department of Justice pursues a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell on Sunday night revealed that the Justice Department opened an investigation into his handling of renovations to the central bank's headquarters and his testimony about the matter to Congress. Powell said the investigation was an attempt to intimidate him as he lowers interest rates at a slower pace than President Donald Trump desires. The GOP resistance could derail his eventual pick to succeed Powell when the Fed chief's term is up in May, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, threatens to block any nominee to the central bank until the investigation is resolved. Tillis' comments are now being echoed by other Republicans. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in a post on X, that the \"administration's investigation is nothing more than an attempt at coercion,\" and called for a congressional investigation into the matter. \"If the Department of Justice believes an investigation into Chair Powell is warranted based on project cost overruns—which are not unusual—then Congress needs to investigate the Department of Justice,\" Murkowski said. \"The stakes are too high to look the other way: if the Federal Reserve loses its independence, the stability of our markets and the broader economy will suffer. My colleague, Senator Tillis, is right in blocking any Federal Reserve nominees until this is resolved.\" Tillis' block is a massive problem for Trump, who has long sought to oust Powell and replace him with an ally. The Banking Committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection can cause a deadlock and block a nominee from advancing. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to replace Powell when his term as Fed chair is up in May. However, Powell could stay on as a governor until 2028. And the chorus of Republicans criticizing the administration over the investigation is only getting louder. Read more CNBC politics coverageSen. Kelly sues DOD Sec.

Even Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a Banking Committee member who is a frequent Powell critic, criticized the investigation. \"Jerome Powell is a bad Fed Chair who has been elusive with Congress, especially regarding the overruns of the elaborate renovations of the building,\" Cramer said. \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest quickly, along with the remainder of Jerome Powell's term. We need to restore confidence in the Fed.\"CNBC has reached out to Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., for comment on the investigation into Powell.Trump does have one ally, however, in his administration's push to investigate Powell: Sen Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. \"Whether Chairman Powell was unprepared for his testimony or intentionally misled Congress about the Fed's extravagant spending, the American people deserve answers. I will wait for the DOJ to release its findings before commenting further,\" Lummis said.  CNBC has reached out to the White House for a response to the members' complaints. This story is developing.

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold hit a fresh record high on Monday, extending a blistering rally as investors piled into havens amid a swirl of geopolitical and policy shocks in recent days.Spot gold advanced 2% to hit over $4,600 an ounce for the first time, before paring gains slightly, data from LSEG showed. Prices have risen around 6% this year alone so far.An investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and speculation over whether it could hasten a leadership change at the Fed has added a fresh layer of policy risk: \"Especially if it results in him stepping down and then leaving the Fed earlier than scheduled and is replaced by someone more in favor of rate cuts,\" said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.Federal prosecutors are examining a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters and Powell's testimony to Congress, Powell said Sunday night. The Fed Chair added that the investigation stems from President Donald Trump's long-running frustration with the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates as aggressively or as quickly as he has urged.The scenario that the appointment of a new Fed Chair may pave the way for faster interest-rate cuts, is traditionally supportive for gold. Lower interest rates tend to lift gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding a metal that pays no yield. That effect has been amplified by recent U.S. economic data that pointed to a cooling labor market. Latest flashpoints involving Iran and Venezuela also further catalyzed gold's appeal as a safe haven.Tensions with Iran have resurfaced after Washington signaled it is weighing options to respond to unrest in the country. The U.S. also launched a military operation in Venezuela at the start of the year that saw the capture of the country's president Nicolas Maduro last weekend.\"They all add to the narrative of heightened geopolitical uncertainty that led us to pick gold as one of highest conviction asset classes this year,\" said Rajat Bhattacharya, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered.While the U.S. action in Venezuela has appeared to reach a relatively swift resolution, the episode still highlights the persistence of geopolitical uncertainty and the risk of flare-ups across multiple regions, Bank of Singapore's Eli Lee similarly echoed.watch nowIn such an environment, Lee expects gold prices to see further support amid an ongoing backdrop of geopolitical unpredictability. Beyond geopolitics, the structural case for gold remains intact, the bank added, as investors reassess portfolio allocations following years of sanctions, geopolitical fragmentation and fiscal-monetary complexity. HSBC said trading momentum could carry prices to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, even as volatility remains elevated and pullbacks may become more frequent.The London-headquartered bank attributed the rally to a combination of safe-haven demand, a weaker U.S. dollar and policy uncertainty, noting that its FX strategists expect the greenback to remain soft in 2026. \"Mounting fiscal deficits in the U.S. and other nations are encouraging gold demand and may be a key factor going forward,\" the bank said.Central banks are also expected to remain strong buyers this year as they diversify away from the dollar, although HSBC cautioned that purchases may fall below the peaks seen between 2022 and 2024 due to high prices.Gold prices saw a nearly 65% yearly gain in 2025, the highest in decades.",

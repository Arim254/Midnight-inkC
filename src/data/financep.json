    "body": "Prenups are on the rise, says Jacqueline Combs, a Los Angeles-based matrimonial and family law attorney. A prenuptial agreement spells out how financial assets like investments, real estate and joint accounts will be divided in the event of a divorce. A 2022 survey by the Harris Poll found that 42% of U.S. adults support the use of prenups, and 35% of those who aren't married say they'd likely sign one in the future. In 2010, just 3% of married or engaged couples had a prenup.Combs, who's represented celebrities like Emily Ratajkowski and Chris Appleton, has seen a higher rate of prenups in younger generations. For Gen Z, for example, mental health is at the forefront and \"the taboo of divorces is long gone,\" she says.Here are a few reasons she believes Gen Z is embracing prenups.'There's so much more access to information today'Born between about 1997 and 2012, Gen Zers grew up in a time with greater access to the internet. Many also came of age when smartphones became the default cellphone of use.As such, for this younger generation, \"there's so much more access to information,\" says Combs, \"via the news, social media, the internet.\" Combined with seeing how divorce has played out in their own families, Gen Z now has more awareness about what marriage and divorce can look like, including an awareness about financial decisions couples can make.Gen Z wants transparency and 'clear expectations'Combs has also seen this generation approach relationships a little differently.Gen Z is looking for \"authenticity in their relationships\" and \"clear expectations,\" she says. They want open conversation and transparency, including transparency about finances. A quarter of Gen Zers believe an honest conversation about money should occur after the initial stage of getting to know each other but before you get serious, according to Northwestern Mutual's 2023 Planning and Progress Study. And 38% believe the conversation should happen after you're serious but well ahead of marriage and living together. Big picture, this rise in prenups is a trend Combs supports. One of the biggest reasons for divorce is money, she says.\"You want clear financial expectations up front so that you are aligned on money decisions and you can avoid disputes\" down the line, she says.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Students are seen on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 14, 2025.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal authorities released Columbia University student Elmina Aghayeva on Thursday afternoon, hours after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered a university residential hall in New York City and took the native of Azerbaijan into custody, the school said.New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani earlier said President Donald Trump had called to tell him that Aghayeva would be released following a meeting at the White House, where the mayor had urged the president to set her free.Aghayeva was arrested by ICE agents at around 6:30 a.m. in Manhattan.Columbia University's acting president, Claire Shipman, accused ICE of entering university property under false pretenses.\"Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a 'missing person,' \" and then detained Aghayeva, Shipman said in an email obtained by CNBC.All law enforcement agents require a judicial warrant or subpoena to enter housing and other non-public campus areas, Shipman said in the email. Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, in an X post, said that ICE \"used a phony missing persons bulletin\" about a 5-year-old girl.\"They purposefully deceived campus housing/security to gain entry to the student's apartment,\" Hoylman-Sigal wrote. \"The level of civil rights violations that took place is staggering.\"The federal agents identified themselves as police looking for a missing child when entering the building, Shipman alleged in a separate email to the campus community Thursday night. Camera footage showed agents in the hallway sharing pictures of the purported child, she added.Shipman added that federal agents did not produce a warrant despite repeated requests from a Columbia University public safety officer. They also refused to allow the officer to call his boss, Shipman added.\"This was a frightening and fast-moving situation and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff,\" Shipman said in the email.A Department of Homeland Security official told CNBC that ICE agents arrested Aghayeva, whose student visa was terminated by the Obama administration in 2016, after \"the building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.\"\"She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,\" said the official, whose agency oversees ICE.The incident comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan earlier this month said the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, sparking backlash against the White House's efforts.Columbia has been in the Trump administration's crosshairs since the president returned to office last year.The Education Department in June said the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration cut.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released in June after three months in ICE detention.",

The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said in a short statement Friday that a truce had taken effect in southern Ukraine to enable the restoration of the 330-kilovolt supply line to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\"Demining activities are ongoing to ensure safe access for the repair teams,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on social media.The local ceasefire, which the IAEA said it had helped to secure, comes shortly after the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of the invasion. Situated in the southeast of the country, the plant is Ukraine's largest and houses six of its 15 operational nuclear power reactors. It has recently been reliant on external power to sustain all essential nuclear safety functions. Both sides have accused each other of raising the risk of a catastrophic accident by staging attacks near to the plant.Russian nuclear power company Rosatom said Friday that IAEA specialists located at the power plant were monitoring repairs to the disconnected power line, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.Ukraine's Foreign Ministry had not responded to CNBC's request for comment as this article went live.View of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant from right bank of Dnipro river.

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersUBS' top equity strategist dialed back his view on U.S. stocks, citing mounting risks from a weakening dollar, stretched valuations and policy turbulence in Washington.Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at the investment bank, downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\" in a fully invested global equity portfolio, arguing that the factors that powered years of outperformance are starting to fade.The dollar risk is a central concern, Garthwaite wrote. UBS forecasts the euro climbing to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter and sees \"asymmetric structural downside risks\" to the greenback. Historically, when the dollar's trade-weighted index falls 10%, U.S. equities underperform by roughly 4% in unhedged terms, according to the bank. Foreign markets are trouncing the U.S. this year as a weaker dollar and cheaper valuations draw capital overseas. The MSCI World ex-US index has gained about 8% in 2026, compared with the little changed performance for the S&P 500. Japan's Nikkei 225 has rallied 17% year to date, while the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7%, underscoring a sharp rotation away from American equities. U.S. stocks struggled again Friday as investors fretted over the potential downsides of the artificial intelligence buildout and persistent inflation at home.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 year to dateAnother pillar of U.S. stock strength — corporate buybacks — is also losing its edge, the bank said. The buyback yield in the U.S. is now only roughly on par with global peers, eroding what had been a key support for earnings per share growth and investor flows, UBS said. The combined shareholder yield from dividends and buybacks in the U.S. is now about half that of Europe, the bank said.\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" Garthwaite wrote.Valuations add to the unease. UBS calculates that the sector-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio for US stocks is 35% above international peers, versus an average premium of about 4% since 2010. Roughly 60% of sectors trade not only at higher multiples than their global counterparts but also above their own historical premium, the strategist wrote.Policy volatility under President Donald Trump is another headwind. This year has brought shifts in tariff policy, proposals to cap credit-card interest rates, potential limits on private equity investment in housing, renewed scrutiny of drug pricing and suggestions to curb dividends and buybacks for defense companies, UBS said.Still, the noted strategist stopped short of turning outright bearish. Garthwaite said the U.S. economy and equities tend to benefit more than peers when markets are in the early phases of a potential bubble. The bank also expects artificial intelligence adoption to outpace most other major regions, with the possible exception of China, helping sustain earnings growth across key industries.UBS strategist Sean Simonds set a year-end target of 7,500 for the S&P 500, compared with an average forecast of 7,629 among 14 top strategists, according to CNBC Pro's strategist survey.

    "body": "A sign of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis is seen on the top of a building in Basel, Switzerland, Sept. 9, 2025.Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesNovartis, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and Genentech, a major biotech firm, say they've uncovered a \"dangerous scheme\" to import their allergy medication from Canada into the U.S. in violation of U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations.Both are suing SHARx — a so-called alternative funding program — and a Canadian pharmacy over the importation of Xolair, an injectable prescription medication for patients with severe asthma, food allergies and respiratory conditions, to an allergy and asthma center in Michigan.\"Biological medicines, like the U.S. Xolair medicine, require particular care because their complex composition and sensitivity to variation in storage and handling conditions are susceptible to contamination and degradation that could undermine their safety and efficacy,\" according to the lawsuit, filed on Feb. 2 in U.S. District Court in Michigan.The suit said the scheme circumvents FDA regulations that generally prohibit importation of unapproved medications from overseas. The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the importation of the drug. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a CNBC investigation that revealed a growing class of businesses called alternative funding programs, or AFPs, which promise to connect patients with more affordable options for accessing medications that often come at very high costs. The AFPs are able to obtain the overseas drugs at a substantially reduced price.Federal authorities told CNBC last year that importing medications from foreign markets is illegal and could pose risks to patients' health.watch nowAFPs contract with employer-sponsored health plans to offer coverage on specialty drugs. They often work with private employers, school districts, local governments and unions.CNBC's investigation revealed that in at least one case, an employer required its staff to obtain their high-cost medication through SHARx or said it wouldn't be covered. SHARx last year defended its business model, telling CNBC it provides an alternative to expensive drugs in the U.S. SHARx, which is based in St. Louis, Missouri, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment about the lawsuit.According to the complaint, the shipment of Xolair to the Michigan allergy center came from Campbell Heights Pharmacy in British Columbia, Canada. The pharmacy also did not respond to a request for comment.The suit said SHARx \"continues to brazenly deceive patients into believing they are receiving the same safe, securely supplied medicines that they would receive from a U.S. retail pharmacy.\"The drug has strict shipping and temperature controls, the suit said.Drugs not approved for the U.S. market that are shipped from overseas can result in contamination, potentially leading to \"serious patient injury and even death,\" the suit said.A separate lawsuit, filed in late 2024 by Gilead Sciences, similarly alleges that other alternative funding programs illegally import medications. The AFPs in the case, which is pending, have denied any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive refunds of $100 on average, though State Farm says the amount will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in cost savings for customers.That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid $1 billion in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business. Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

The phenomenal Nvidia results that failed to answer questions over whether the enormous hyperscaler splurge will result in significant profits further down the line? The rising tensions between Iran and the U.S.?Let me play the fool for a moment, because I think the news from a medium-sized tech payments company might have longer term tremors and be a warning of societal upheaval far greater than other stories of the week.Block, a $33 billion company, surged in extended trading on Thursday after cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey, best known for cofounding Twitter, told the market he is laying off nearly half his workforce.He wrote to shareholders that 4,000 of the 10,000 were \"being asked to leave or entering into consultation\" to leave. Again: That is nearly half his workforce!Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the job cuts would position the company \"for our next phase of long term growth.\"\"We are choosing to shift how we operate at a time when our business is accelerating and we see an opportunity to move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work,\" Ahuja wrote.Job cuts happen all the time, but what Dorsey had to say should be a wake-up call for everyone.He said he expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from \"intelligence tools.\"Let that sink in: Dorsey expects other companies to similarly overhaul their workforces as they see more efficiency gains from \"intelligence tools.\"\"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes,\" he wrote.Do the math: 10,000 jobs to just under 6,000 replicated across industries across the nation, across the world.So a new, growth company, not an old economy business, has just said companies will cut huge swathes of their workforces as new intelligence tools become diffuse.I keep getting told on CNBC that AI will create new jobs to replace those being lost. I've been asking the same question for years now. \"What are those jobs? Where are the mass of jobs for the millions whose roles are set to be made redundant?\" And I hear the same old trope every time – \"oh those jobs haven't been created yet.\"I think it's time we got a better answer, no?",

    "body": "watch nowWholesale prices rose at a faster-than-expected pace in January, countering hopes that inflation was easing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The core producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8%, more than the 0.6% gain in December and well ahead of the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 0.3%.On an all-items basis, the headline PPI rose 0.5%, also above the forecast for 0.3% and 0.1 percentage point more than the prior month.For the full year, core wholesale prices accelerated 3.6%, while the headline index posted a 2.9% gain. Both figures are well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal and suggest that rising prices are still a factor for the U.S. economy.Stock market futures added to losses following the report. Services prices primarily drove the increase, with a 0.8% monthly rise that was the highest since July 2025. By contrast, goods prices actually fell 0.3%, though core goods prices climbed 0.7%.More than 20% of the increase in services came from margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. On the goods side, energy and food prices both fell while metals prices rose 4.8%.Trade services prices surged 2.5%, helping boost pressures on wholesale inflation.The report comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation has been tamed. Pipeline pressures as indicated by the PPI figures could keep the Fed cautious as it weighs its next moves on interest rates. Markets largely expect the Fed to stay on the sidelines until the summer, though Trump and other White House officials have pushed for lower rates.Economists have worried that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher, though Fed officials largely expect the impact to be temporary. There was some evidence of tariffs in the PPI data, with indexes for apparel and other goods such as intermediate components moving higher.Trump lost a key Supreme Court ruling that overturned his move to use emergency measures to implement the tariffs. However, the president has cited other authorities that will allow him to implement the duties anyway.",

The 10-year gilt yield stood at 4.267% on Friday morning, while the 30-year gilt yield was last seen at 5.069%.Spencer, a 34-year-old plumber and plasterer, becomes the fifth sitting Green lawmaker in Britain's 650-seat House of Commons.watch now\"Instead of working for a nice life, we're working to line the pockets of billionaires. We are being bled dry and I don't think it is extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life,\" she said in her victory speech.Labour won the Gorton and Denton seat with almost 51% of the vote at the national general election in July 2024, when Starmer swept to power and ousted the Conservative Party after 14 years in office.In an interview with broadcasters, Starmer described the result as \"very disappointing\" and said he understood that voters were \"frustrated\" and \"impatient for change.\"The change in fortunes for the ruling party appears to suggest that voters could be willing to look beyond the main parties of Labour and the Conservatives, or Tories, to more alternative parties such as the Greens and Reform UK in the wider local elections in May.watch nowJohn Curtice, a prominent political scientist and professor of politics at the U.K.'s University of Strathclyde, said the result shows the two main parties are being challenged.\"We are getting an unprecedented challenge by Reform, as it were from the right, stroke the more socially conservative end of Britain, challenging the Conservative party. And now, the Greens apparently now serious competitors with Labour for voters on the left and those of a more social liberal disposition,\" Curtice told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday.\"Historically, in Britain, we've said elections are won and lost on the center ground. That's not what is happening at the moment,\" he added.'Energy boost'\"The Green Party will be absolutely cock-a-hoop,\" Damian Lyons Lowe, CEO of London-based polling company Survation, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Friday.  watch now\"I think people looking forward now to the local elections, certainly this is a really, kind of, energy boost for the Green Party because the wasted vote argument that is normally the curse of the Green Party — that a vote for the Greens is just letting Reform in, for example, or the Tories in,\" Lowe said.\"Those voters will feel energized and I think the Greens will do better than they would have done otherwise in the local elections in May,\" he added.",

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

    "description": "Wages have largely kept up with inflation since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 — but for many workers, it hasn't felt like much of a win.Price ",
    "body": "Wages have largely kept up with inflation since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 — but for many workers, it hasn't felt like much of a win.Price increases and pay gains have seesawed over the past five years, leaving inflation-adjusted wages roughly flat overall since 2020.Meanwhile, inflation reached a post-pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but has since cooled. New inflation data released Tuesday shows consumer prices rose by a year-over-year rate of 2.7% in December, according to the Consumer Price Index, which tracks the prices of things people buy regularly, from groceries and rent to gasoline and medical care. That brings it closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but even so, inflation has remained above that level since February 2021, and many households are feeling the squeeze.Slower inflation doesn't mean prices are falling — it means they're rising more slowly. Since early 2020, cumulative CPI inflation is up by roughly 25%, marking one of the fastest increases in decades. Those higher prices are now part of everyday household budgets, especially for essentials like food and housing.\"Even though inflation has moderated, prices continue to rise, keeping it a persistent source of frustration,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It.Wages have caught up — but only barelyAfter falling behind during the inflation surge, wage growth has outpaced inflation over the past two years, allowing pay to catch up by most measures. Even so, over the full period since the pandemic began, inflation-adjusted wages show little net improvement overall.Since the first quarter of 2020, wages adjusted for CPI have been largely flat across several common measures, according to analysis from the Hamilton Project, a nonpartisan economic research group.Those measures include the closely watched Employment Cost Index, which tracks pay changes for the same set of jobs over time, making it a useful way to see how wages are rising relative to inflation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ECI, along with other common measures, show the total inflation-adjusted change since early 2020:Employment Cost Index: –0.19%Median weekly earnings: +0.41%Average hourly earnings: +0.44%Total compensation, including benefits: +1.25%Taken together, the data show that inflation-adjusted wage growth since 2020 has been close to zero.But for many workers, \"flat\" wages don't feel flat — they feel lagging. Take median weekly earnings, for instance: Inflation-adjusted pay is only slightly higher than it was five years ago, amounting to gains for some workers and little or none for many others.Kates says those uneven outcomes become clearer when wages are broken down by income level. Wage growth for lower-paid workers has slowed more sharply than for higher earners in recent years, based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. For households with less room in their budgets, slower wage growth makes it harder to absorb higher prices for everyday necessities.\"Median wage data masks various outcomes across the total population of workers. When wages are broken out by quartile, the lowest-income earners are seeing little to no inflation-adjusted growth,\" says Kates.For many workers, \"it feels like stagnation because it is,\" he says.The combination of modest wage gains and higher price levels may help explain why sentiment around household finances remains weak. In a November poll of 1,114 Americans from YouGov, 53% said their household income is just keeping up with expenses, while 32% said they are falling behind.Similarly, 62% of employed Americans say their income hasn't kept up with household expenses, according to a December Bankrate survey. Among those who don't expect their finances to improve in 2026, 65% cited inflation as the main reason, compared with about 30% who pointed to factors like government policies or stagnant income.For many Americans, flat real wages mean they're no longer losing ground as quickly — but they're not getting ahead either.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged that disconnect. Speaking in December, he said many households are still grappling with \"embedded higher cost due to higher inflation in 2022 and '23,\" even as inflation slows.\"We're going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher, significantly positive ... for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" Powell said.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Adam Galici | CNBCBNY, which calls itself the world's largest custody bank, is raising a pair of key performance targets as CEO Robin Vince says a turnaround that began when he took over three years ago is taking hold.The bank is boosting its medium-term targets for pretax margin and return on tangible common equity by 5 percentage points each, to 38% and 28%, respectively, according to materials provided by the bank.Vince, a former Goldman Sachs executive who joined BNY in 2020 and became the bank's CEO in 2022, said that the move demonstrates increased confidence in the company's prospects going forward. Banks overall have also benefited from several deregulatory efforts under Trump administration regulators. \"We're increasing our medium-term targets, because we have the confidence that we think there's a lot more value and potential for us to unlock over the long term,\" Vince said in an interview, adding that medium-term targets had a three- to five-year horizon.\"Three years in, we've really demonstrated a track record of execution and strong performance, which gives us confidence that the strategy is working and that there's a clear turnaround that's happening at the company,\" he said.

Mahsa | Afp | Getty ImagesCrude oil prices rose about 3% on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled all meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that help is on the way. U.S. crude oil rose $1.96, or 3.29%, to $61.46 per barrel by 11:42 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was up $1.99, or 3.12%, to $65.86 per barrel. The Islamic Republic's security forces have cracked down on large-scale demonstrations with hundreds of people reportedly dead. The government has cut off Internet access in Iran, making it difficult to verify how the situation is evolving on the ground. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if the Islamic Republic kills protestors. \"Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday. \"They will pay a big price,\" the president said. \"I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!\"Iran is a member of OPEC and a major crude oil producer. The oil market is monitoring whether the unrest could lead to a disruption of supplies.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.",

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Danish renewables giant Orsted rose nearly 5% on Tuesday morning, shortly after a U.S. judge cleared the company to resume work on its nearly finished Revolution Wind project.In a statement, Orsted welcomed the ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, saying the action would allow the company \"to restart impacted activities immediately.\"The ruling is a legal setback for the pro-fossil fuel Trump administration, which moved to block the $5 billion Revolution Wind project.The White House halted five major offshore wind developments at the end of last year, including Orsted's project off the coast of Rhode Island. Officials cited national security concerns identified by the Pentagon as the reason for the suspension.Orsted filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration's decision earlier this month, saying that the lease suspension would cause \"substantial harm\" to the Revolution Wind project.In a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said the Court should be \"very skeptical of the government's true motives\" for putting a stop to the project, according to Reuters news agency.\"You want to stop everything in place, costing them one-and-a-half million a day, while you decide what you want to do?\" Lamberth asked Justice Department attorney Peter Torstensen.A spokesperson for the U.S. Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read moreMichael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, said the U.S. judge's decision was clearly welcome news for the likes of Orsted and Danish wind turbine maker Vestas but warned of further industry uncertainty.\"It's certainly a win for these companies anyway — and they have had such a hard time over the last year or so that they could definitely use that,\" Field told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"But … whether Trump will find a way around this or find some other way to maybe go at these companies is the question. So, I wouldn't be completely celebrating as of yet,\" he added.Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.Shares of Orsted traded 4.5% higher at around 10 a.m. London time (5 a.m. ET). Vestas, meanwhile, was last seen up around 1.6%. Shares of Norway's Equinor, whose Empire Wind 1 project was also impacted, were last seen 2.7% higher. U.S.-listed Dominion Energy, the developer of the halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, the largest of its kind in America, was flat in pre-market trade. ",

    "body": "When it comes to identifying great ideas, billionaire Barry Diller has a simple piece of advice: Don't be a cynic.Diller is a big fan of \"creative conflict\" group brainstorming sessions, he said in an interview for an episode of CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook,\" set to air on Wednesday. In a creative conflict setting, team members passionately argue about an idea, weighing differing opinions for however long it takes to reach a decision. It can be \"loud and argumentative ... and somewhat brutal,\" but \"I think it's a great environment,\" he said.For group brainstorming to work effectively, resulting in top-tier ideas, you'll need to genuinely consider other people's opinions, said Diller, chairman and senior executive of holding company IAC and travel technology company Expedia Group.\"You have to try and be naive,\" said Diller, 83, who also co-founded the Fox Broadcasting Company. \"You cannot be cynical. Cynicism kills everything. You have to force naivete.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsIf you're cynical, you may think your team member is pitching an idea that only benefits them — or that since you've been at your organization the longest, you naturally know more than the next person.Instead of being dismissive, go into these ideation sessions with a beginner's attitude, said Diller, who has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. That doesn't mean being foolish, ignorant or easily steamrolled — rather, you're open to fresh perspectives, learning something new and being challenged.\"I've always held on to being a dopey naive as much as I can,\" said Diller. \"You know, as you go through life, you just get more sophisticated and the natural tendencies get more cynical. If you want to use your instincts, you have to brush that clean every day practically.\"How listening can help you make difficult decisionsThe value of considering your colleagues' unconventional ideas can go beyond brainstorming.In the interview, Diller discussed IAC's purchase of a majority stake in Expedia. In July 2001, Diller made a deal to buy a 75% stake in Expedia for about $1 billion. Two months later, before the deal was completed, the September 11 terrorist attacks halted U.S. travel almost entirely.Expedia had \"zero revenue for a while, and it came back relatively quickly, but at that critical moment, when we had to make the decision, there was no business,\" said Diller. \"Several people said, 'This is not the time to pay over a billion dollars for something that, right now, is so completely unpredictable' ... But someone in the room, when we were talking about this, at the height of the argument, said, 'If there's life, there's travel.'\"\"As soon as I heard it, I said, 'Close [the deal]. I'm betting on that if there's life, there's travel ... and if there isn't life, then who cares anyway?' And that was it. It was very binary.\"Diller's IAC finally acquired Expedia in August 2003, and Diller helped steer the company through the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. Expedia Group now owns and operates several other travel sites including Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity and Trivago, and currently has a $36.44 billion market cap.Watch Barry Diller on CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook″ on Wednesday, Jan. 14 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT. All new episodes Wednesdays.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "A Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-332(ER).Joan Valls | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDelta Air Lines' earnings could jump more than 20% this year from 2025 thanks to robust travel demand, particularly at the high end of the market, and potentially reach a record, CEO Ed Bastian said.Delta on Tuesday forecast adjusted earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.50 this year, compared with analysts' estimate for $7.25 a share.The carrier, the first airline to report quarterly results this year, forecast an increase in sales of as much as 7% in the first three months of 2026 and adjusted earnings of between 50 cents per share and 90 cents per share for the first quarter, compared with 72 cents per share forecast by analysts polled by LSEG.Bastian said Delta sits at the top of the \"K\" in the so-called K-shaped economy, with more revenue coming from higher-spending customers.\"We are looking at our seat growth in the coming year. ... Effectively, none of our growth in seats will be in the main cabin; virtually all will be in the premium sector,\" Bastian told reporters.Main cabin ticket revenue fell 7% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $5.62 billion, while premium ticket revenue, for seats at the front of the plane, rose 9% to nearly $5.7 billion, with that segment overtaking the standard coach class, ahead of Delta's estimate for it to occur this year. For the full year, main cabin revenue was still higher than premium classes.Bookings are strong from both leisure customers and corporate travelers in the first few days of the year, Delta said. The airline also started 2025 with expectations for a record year, but it trimmed its estimates after President Donald Trump implemented tariffs early last year and the longest-ever government shutdown, which ended in late November, snarled air travel and bookings fell.Bastian struck a more cautious tone this year, telling reporters \"we're not going to project or commit to a record earnings [forecast] until we understand the uncertainty,\" he said. \"I think we're well aware of the risk factors,\" he said. \"This past year, and I think again this year ... [will] be more of the geopolitical environment, whether that's international or on domestic policy.\"Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.55 adjusted vs. $1.53 expectedRevenue: $14.61 billion adjusted vs. $14.69 billion expectedEven with its reduced forecast, Delta posted a profit of $1.22 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.86 a share, up close to 45% from a year earlier, on revenue of $16 billion, up 3% from 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, Delta posted earnings of $1.02 billion or $1.55 a share, slightly ahead of estimates. Bastian said premium product growth is outpacing sales growth for the main cabin, continuing an existing trend.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing's deliveries are highest in 7 years.

    "body": "TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping arrive for talks at the Gimhae Air Base, located next to the Gimhae International Airport in Busan on October 30, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's threat of 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran has raised the risk of derailing Washington's fragile trade deal with Beijing — Tehran's largest trading partner. Trump said Monday night stateside that the U.S. will start charging a 25% tariff on imports from countries that do business with Iran. The order is \"effective immediately,\" he said in a Truth Social post.   The world's top two economies had secured an interim trade deal in late October that saw a roll back of punitive U.S. tariffs on China, while Beijing paused its sweeping rare earth export controls.In response to Trump's tariff threat China said it \"firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction,\" while warning that it would take \"all necessary measures\" to defend its interests, according to a post on X by a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S.If Trump is serious about the 25% rate, \"that is a massive escalation from current tariff levels,\" said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. She warned the situation could easily spiral into fresh rounds of tit-for-tat escalation, not to mention dashing any hopes of U.S. soybean exports to China. \"The last time we played this game, we ended up with tariff levels at 145%.\"    watch nowAs the world's largest importer of oil, Beijing has long bought crude from Iran — and other countries sanctioned by the U.S. — offering a crucial economic lifeline to the Middle Eastern regime reeling from Western curbs. Iranian crude oil shipments to China more than doubled between 2017 and 2024 on a per-day basis to over 1.2 million barrels, according to estimates by Muyu Xu, senior analyst at commodity intelligence firm Kpler. As of 2022, fuel accounted for more than half of China's imports from Iran, according to World Bank's latest data. However, China has since stepped back its trade amid tighter U.S. sanctions. Imports from Iran were on track for a fourth-straight year of decline in 2025, falling 28% in the January to November period from a year earlier, according to official data compiled by Wind Information. China is expected to release full-year trade data on Wednesday.Beijing will not reduce its economic cooperation with Iran due to Trump's tariff threat, Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, told reporters Tuesday morning. \"The Iran situation has certainly entered a very dangerous period. We should all pay closer attention,\" Cui said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He attributed Trump's interest in Iran to energy resources — more oil production than Venezuela, just when U.S. electricity demand is surging in order to power AI. While Cui declined to directly address the implications for U.S.-China relations, he said that in-person meetings are an important indicator.After Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea last fall, the two sides agreed to a 1-year trade truce. Tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. were set to stay around 47.5%, down from a high of more than 100% during the peak of trade tensions in the spring. The U.S. president is expected to visit Beijing in April, followed by a reciprocal visit by Xi later in the year. \"Trump is eroding the thin trust build around [the] trade truce,\" said Dan Wang, China director at Eurasia Group. \"Trump was already widely viewed by Chinese public and government as inconsistent.\" The U.S. and China have had a history of piling on pressure to build leverage ahead of major diplomatic meetings. Tensions had escalated sharply ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting in October, with Beijing expanding export controls on rare earths and launching anti-trust probes into U.S. chip maker Qualcomm, while Washington reportedly planned to curb chip-design software to China. \"There will likely be several rounds of similar tit-for-tat, leading up to April meeting,\" said Wang.    Wang said China could respond with sanctions on U.S. firms tied to Taiwan arms sales, or antitrust probes of American tech firms operating in China, while ruling out additional rare earths restrictions.It remains to be seen to what extent the tariffs materialize. The U.S. Supreme Court could make a ruling Wednesday on the legality of Trump's use of duties.The threat of tariffs on Iran's trading partners appeared to be driven by Trump's \"ever shifting focus of attention, not as part of an intentional strategy to gain new leverage over China in advance of the likely April summit,\" said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Still, \"China will not hesitate to retaliate in a way that imposes serious costs on the U.S. [and it] has prepared for a variety of scenarios, including this one,\" Kennedy added.  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO, David Ellison and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, David Zaslav.David A. Grogan | CNBC| Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images |It is extremely rare for a merger and acquisition story to break out from the business pages. Yet, when it comes to the sale process of Warner Brothers Discovery it has become mainstream news as probably the most compelling media industry story of the last 12 months. I suppose it is fairly obvious as to why, with such universally known media brands involved in the fray from Netflix, HBO, Paramount, CBS, CNN and MTV. These are media brands of real significance so one might assume who owns it is a significant issue in itself.But is it?There are a number of perspectives from which to answer this question. Should TV viewers care? Should policy makers care? Should the industry care? Should President Donald Trump care? And, probably most importantly, should shareholders care?David Ellison, newly installed CEO of Paramount and son of one of the world's wealthiest billionaires, Larry Ellison, decided to make an aggressive move to attempt to acquire all of Warner prior to Warner's decision to split itself into two companies. One company was to consist of HBO and the Warner movie and TV studios, and another created holding all the Warner cable networks, which include CNN. Ellison made this preemptive move to capture the Warner assets, correctly strategizing that Paramount would be the only bidder for the entire company. However, his move catalyzed the Warner board to entertain bids for just the studios and HBO as well, which then created a highly competitive bidding situation. In a move that industry analysts considered extremely surprising, Netflix made a very aggressive bid for the HBO and the Warner studios, and was able to convince the board that its $27.75 per share offer of mostly cash and some Netflix stock, was more valuable than the $30 per share that Paramount offered for the whole company, because it was leaving behind the cable networks which the Warner board valued as worth more than the difference between the two bids. The Warner board also strongly believed that the Netflix offer had terms that made its offer carry greater certainty to close than the Paramount offer. The Ellisons have now decided to go hostile and take their offer to shareholders and this has sparked enormous debate about who should own these assets. WBD's board told shareholders to reject this latest hostile bid on Jan. 7.Does it matter to viewers?First, from a consumer point of view, television viewers care about having substantial amount of choice, at reasonable prices, with plenty of quality productions. Since all the major streaming services seek today is greater engagement — meaning more viewers watching for longer periods of time — whoever owns the Warner studios and HBO will have plenty of incentive to produce more than they currently do and maintain the perception of high quality that HBO commands amongst consumers. Either buyer will serve this consumer interest.The anti-Netflix argument is that since Netflix is the far bigger streaming service today than Paramount+, that it will command sufficient market power to raise price in a way that will be detrimental to streaming subscribers. However, Netflix has pursued a pricing strategy that actually offers the lowest cost service for subscribers that are willing to accept ads, and the highest price service for those who do not want advertisements. This strategy has worked incredibly well for them and there is little reason to think this approach would change, of offering its entire service at the lowest cost. Moreover, as Netflix has argued, being able to offer Netflix and HBO services as a discounted bundle might well provide substantial savings over the status quo for those subscribers that have both services, which is the vast majority of HBO subs. In addition, Paramount, like some of the other services that are much smaller than Netflix and struggling for profitability, have a need to continue to substantially increase the price of their services.Of particular note when considering the issue of consumer choice, Netflix has indicated it will keep the HBO service alive, whereas Paramount+ and HBO are likely to merge into a single stronger service which one might argue will eliminate some degree of choice for consumers, compared to keeping HBO alive as a separate offering.Nevertheless, whoever wins this bidding war will be subject to regulatory review, and that poses questions of competition which is what policymakers most concern themselves with. It is hard to argue that Paramount+ is not a subscale service that badly needs to combine with another player in order to compete with the larger players in the market such as Disney and Amazon, and of course, Netflix. So, yes, competition will be enhanced by Paramount+ combining with HBO to become a stronger streaming player, but just because it is more pro-competitive for Paramount to acquire Warner, however, that does not mean it is anti-competitive under the antitrust laws for Netflix to absorb the Warner properties. What's best for Hollywood?So, let's look at this issue from an industry perspective. Paramount has announced it plans to cut costs far more aggressively once the companies are merged than Netflix anticipates doing so. While much of those cuts will come on the cable side which Netflix would not be buying, many of those cuts will also come from HBO and Paramount+ combining, and maybe more importantly from the Paramount and Warner studios combining. Beyond jobs, combining the Paramount and Warner studios would reduce the number of major studios producing theatrical motion pictures which clearly reduces competition — just as Disney's acquisition in recent years of 20th Century Fox eliminated the latter as a major studio player. The industry counter argument is that Netflix has not been a believer in movie theater distribution and would look to put its output on its streaming service and substantially reduce what plays theatrically. Yet, the response to that argument is Netflix has made very little impact in the media zeitgeist as a producer of movies as compared to its television series, while it has been able to garner substantial viewership from movies that it licenses from third party studios. The difference there is that those licensed movies have had theatrical runs with all the promotional marketing that goes along with those releases, and there is good reason to believe that in order to drive greater engagement of viewers when it comes to movies on Netflix that they would maintain movie theater distribution in order to drive the type of promotional awareness that have made for successful movie runs on the streaming service. There is the further industry issue of how do you even measure competition when it comes to television viewership. Paramount would like regulators to define the relevant market as being streaming services that air long-form tv shows and movies, because under that analysis Netflix combined with HBO Max would have about a 28% market share, whereas Paramount plus HBO Max would only have about a 7% share. This approach would exclude YouTube's first place share of connected TV streaming viewing of 24%. Yet with YouTube included, the Netflix/HBO Max share of streaming to the tv set audience is only about 20%, still below YouTube's viewing share. With YouTube having just bid the Oscars away from Disney/ABC and the Disney streaming services, it is hard to argue that YouTube should not be considered as part of the relevant TV market. The real critical number though is that HBO Max's share of streaming viewing is only 2.6%, so in any event it adds a nominal amount of increased viewership to Netflix, and the resulting Netflix share would not typically rise to the level of concentration that would cause regulators to upset a transaction. The better argument for Netflix actually is that it doesn't just compete in the streaming universe, but for the majority of television households today that still receive traditional broadcast and cable channels, those channels are still significant competition for viewing eyeballs — and when those traditional channels are included Netflix only has about an 8% viewing share, and is only in sixth place well behind Paramount. In fact, when considering the totality of television channels and streaming services together, Paramount's acquisition of Warner would catapult it to first place, even ahead of YouTube, when it comes to total viewership based on Nielsen's latest numbers.When it comes to the advertising revenue which attaches to this viewership Netflix ad revenues are still very nascent, and with the addition of HBO Max ad revenue, would still be a small percentage of overall TV advertising. Paramount's much larger ad revenue would close to double with the acquisition, but neither outcome would substantially change competitive dynamics in the TV ad industry. Regulators would also look at the industry concern as to whether the number of players available to license or acquire shows produced by others would involve a reduction in competition. Whether the buyer of Warner was Netflix or Paramount in either case there would be one less buyer of third-party produced TV shows. So on that score, it is hard to claim one buyer or the other makes a competitive difference. Netflix today might have a much bigger programming budget, but Paramount has already proven that it will bid more aggressively for key licensing rights than any other bidder in the marketplace.What does it mean for the news business?While Netflix would not be acquiring CNN, Paramount would be, and it plans to combine CBS News and CNN which would be a smart rationalization of substantial news operations overhead. However, in the course of accomplishing that there would be a reduction of six major broadcast and cable news organizations down to five, a clear elimination of a competitor just as the case would be with Paramount's acquisition of the Warner studios. While many industry observers would bemoan CNN coming under more conservative leaning editorial leadership, in terms of editorial diversity in the overall media marketplace, it would be hard to argue that the opinions and editorial approach CNN represents can't otherwise be found by viewers elsewhere in their diet of news programming choices.So, there are pluses and minuses for consumers and the industry depending on who bought the Warner properties, but there is no clear-cut case that one outcome is better or worse than the other for consumers or the industry.Trump's influenceNot that this should play any role here in determining an outcome, what about the interests of President Trump?Paramount very much thought it had the inside track to getting Trump's blessing on the acquisition, and the President has made no secret of the fact that he plans to weigh in on an unprecedented basis regarding regulatory approval. While he has clear political ties to Larry Ellison, the President's outlook towards Netflix looks pretty benign. However, there is no doubt Trump wants CNN under different ownership because of its current editorial slant, which could well mean if Paramount does not succeed in acquiring all of Warner, he would be less pleased with the outcome. Yet, there seems to be interest in third parties acquiring CNN, or the whole Warner cable bundle including CNN, and Trump could influence regulatory approval of a CNN deal to a new owner so that it is not left to be spun-off for current Warner management to operate. The fact is Trump has been less than fully satisfied with the performance of CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, since Ellison took it over. So Trump standing in the way of a Netflix acquisition of HBO and the Warner studios because of the ultimate fate of CNN seems like a long shot.Alternatively, if Netflix was to acquire HBO and the studios, Paramount might still acquire the cable assets as a way of bulking up the traditional side of the company and having an opportunity to still take out very substantial cost, including the consolidation of CNN and CBS News. In the end, it appears that the only ones who should really care about the outcome here are the shareholders of the three respective companies, where Warner shareholders clearly care about getting the highest price with the greatest certainty that it will be paid, and the Warner board is going to have to be meticulous in making sure that whatever decision they make is guided by that metric. Larry Ellison has now agreed to personally guarantee the Paramount bid, which largely removes the uncertainty around the equity financing the Warner board had been concerned about — though the board has raised issues surrounding the debt financing — so the question of which offer provides a better price and greater certainty for shareholders is still at issue. Beyond the interests of shareholders, with there being pros and cons running in both directions, it is hard to see that either outcome rises to the level that anybody should really care who ends up owning Warner.

    "body": "Despite return-to-office pushes from some employers, plenty of companies are still hiring for flexible roles.A new Flexjobs report identified the top 100 companies hiring for remote and hybrid roles, based on an analysis of around 60,000 companies and their job postings in 2025 in the FlexJobs database.Offering flexible work options allows companies to access \"a broader and more diverse talent pool,\" among other benefits, according to FlexJobs career expert Keith Spencer.Remote work remains popular among employees: a previous FlexJobs survey found that approximately 98% of surveyed workers prefer working hybrid or remote, as opposed to fully in-person.\"Companies that are willing to offer that type of flexibility to their employees often see higher levels of productivity, higher levels of retention, lower attrition,\" Spencer told CNBC Make It. \"They just have a happier workforce.\"According to the report, the top three career categories with the most remote job postings in 2025 were project management, computer and IT, and operations.The top three job titles were account executive, software engineer, and project manager, which is a departure from years past, according to Spencer.\"That list tends to be kind of dominated by tech and finance roles, or at least it has in recent years, so that was a pretty interesting, significant shift,\" he says.This year, 40 of the top 100 best companies for remote and hybrid jobs were newcomers to the list, Spencer says, which \"definitely is a sign of hope for job seekers\" looking for these roles.\"It shows that there's a wide variety of employers who are committing themselves to offering these flexible career options,\" he says.Based on FlexJobs' data, these are the top 10 companies hiring for remote and hybrid roles in 2026.1.

General Electric - GE Industry: Aerospace, Healthcare, Technology, Transportation10. U.S. Bank Industry: Banking, FinanceJob seekers should be aware that there's \"a high level of competition\" for these roles, according to Spencer.\"People have lives and a lot of commitments, and things aren't getting cheaper, so not having to travel or having to buy your lunch, it can make a big difference for people,\" he says.Most of the remote and hybrid job postings in FlexJobs' database are for \"highly skilled\" positions, Spencer says.According to the report,  67% of postings were for \"experienced-level\" roles, followed by manager-level roles at 17% and senior-level positions at 8%. Only 7% were listed as entry-level roles.To land a remote role, it's crucial that candidates are able to communicate their \"ability to deliver results in a remote environment,\" Spencer says.\"In a competitive market, you need to pay careful attention to the requirements of different roles [and] really kind of dissect job descriptions so you understand what the employer's needs and priorities are,\" he says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft on Tuesday promised that consumers won't pay more when the software maker sets up data centers near their communities.The company also committed to replenish more water than it uses and to add to local tax bases in places where it has data centers.\"Our pledge to each of these communities is that we will pay our way as a company, to ensure that our data centers don't increase your electricity prices,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, said at an event held in Great Falls, Virginia, less than 20 miles from the White House. The company will sign deals with utilities in advance, so they can afford to invest in infrastructure that can support new data centers, Smith said.Smith made a similar statement in September in Racine, Wisconsin, near a company data center that's set to come online in early 2026.\"We will pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs in part by collaborating with utilities on plans to add the electricity supply that we will need,\" Smith said. The move comes as utility prices rise across the U.S., where technology companies are racing to build data centers that can run generative artificial intelligence models such as the ones that power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT assistant.

In Caledonia, Wisconsin, where Microsoft was looking to build a data center last year, residents had grievances about water and power use, among other implications. The company decided not to move forward at the site it had considered in the village, citing local feedback.We Energies, a local utility in Wisconsin, has proposed a special electricity rate for large clients' data centers, and Microsoft is asking the state's Public Service Commission to raise the rate the company pays, Smith said.\"We will not go into a local community and ask them to create a local property tax reduction or abatement in order to attract a data center from Microsoft,\" Smith said Tuesday.On Monday, hours before Microsoft's event, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that his administration has been working with the company, which \"will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption.\"The company has maintained a healthy conversation with the White House going back to Trump's inauguration last year, Smith told CNBC's Eamon Javers.\"We really rely on their leadership at the federal level, especially Chris Wright and the Energy Department, Doug Burgum and Interior and across the government,\" Smith said on CNBC. Burgum, secretary of the Interior Department and formerly governor of North Dakota, spent six years as a Microsoft executive after the technology company in 2001 acquired Great Plains Software, where he was CEO.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in October that the company plans to nearly double its data center footprint over the next two years. Microsoft has been building data centers for over 15 years. In the September quarter, the company spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditures and finance leases for cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, up 75% year over year.\"Our goal is to move quickly, partner with local communities, and bring these commitments to life in the first half of this year,\" Smith wrote in a blog post. WATCH: Data center CEO comments on need for speedwatch now",

    "body": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) gives a press statement on the sidelines of his visit to the Bosch company. This is the last stop on his trip to India.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday said the embattled Iranian regime appears to be finished as mass protests continue across the country. Speaking to reporters during his visit to India, Merz renewed calls for Iranian authorities to end their violence against demonstrators, adding that he hopes for a peaceful end to the escalating crisis. \"If a regime can only keep itself in power by force, then it's effectively at the end. I believe we are now seeing the final days and weeks of this regime,\" Merz said, in comments reported by Sky News. \"In any case, it has no legitimacy through elections in the population. The population is now rising up against this regime,\" he added. Merz's comments come as Iran grapples with one of the most widespread anti-government demonstrations in years. The Iranian government has claimed the prolonged protests are now under control, while human rights groups have reported that hundreds have been killed by Iranian security forces in recent weeks. A spokesperson for Iran's embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Read moreU.S. President Donald Trump, who said Monday that any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff, has repeatedly threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.Speaking on Friday, Iran's supreme leader lashed out at anti-government protesters, saying they were \"vandals\" acting on behalf of Trump by destroying public properties.In a broadcast on national television, reported by Reuters, Ali Khamenei warned Tehran would not tolerate \"mercenaries for foreigners.\"\"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people.

    "body": "watch nowAs Americans across incomes look to trim the grocery budget, Aldi plans to open more than 180 stores in the U.S. this year — including on the traditional turf of rival supermarkets and big-box stores.The German grocer's latest growth plans follow an already aggressive expansion over the past decade. Aldi, which is known for its low prices, small stores and emphasis on private brands, has become the third-largest grocer in the country by store count, trailing behind only Walmart and Kroger. And last year, Aldi marked its biggest expansion since it opened its first U.S. store in Iowa in 1976 by opening nearly 200 locations. It had 2,614 stores in the U.S. as of Dec. 31.Along with opening more locations, Aldi said it will relaunch its website and enter Maine, its 40th state, this year. The company will also add new distribution centers in Florida, Arizona and Colorado in the next five years.Grocery in the U.S. has long been a fragmented industry, with slices of the business divided up by regional grocers, specialty players, large supermarket operators, big-box stores and membership-based clubs. Yet Aldi's growth illustrates the fiercer competition traditional players face as discounters lure away shoppers and win more of their weekly grocery runs.\"Consumers now really are not looking for fancy stores, and tens of thousands of different items to choose from,\" said Atty McGrath, CEO of Aldi U.S. \"They're really savvy shoppers. They know that private labels can save them money without sacrificing quality.\"She added, \"people, more and more, are really safeguarding their resources, whether that's the wallet or their time.\" An Aldi grocery store is pictures on May 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesIn a recent survey of grocery shoppers by consulting firm AlixPartners, the percentage of key shopper groups that said they spend most of their grocery budget in the traditional grocery channel dropped for every group compared with 2024. The survey was conducted in September and included 1,635 people.Those declines were sharper among more affluent households and younger shoppers, with a 7 percentage point year-over-year drop among households with an annual income of more than $100,000 and a 6 percentage point year-over-year fall among shoppers between the ages of 25 and 34, the survey found.Matthew Hamory, co-leader of the global grocery practice at AlixPartners, said in particular, large supermarket chain operators such as Kroger, Albertsons and Stop & Shop's parent company Ahold Delhaize have lost ground as discounters like Aldi, Walmart and Costco offer produce, meat and other staples for less. \"U.S. customers have learned that if you go to a discounter, you're not buying crap cheaply,\" he said. \"You're buying good quality fresh food, good quality private brands. They're in stock. They're local to you. And they're convenient.\"Plus, he said U.S. shoppers have gotten more used to buying private brands because of their success at big players like Costco.Despite its rapid growth, Aldi's share of the U.S. grocery market is still small. Walmart is the nation's largest grocer by market share with 21%, according to market researcher Numerator, followed by Kroger, Costco, Albertsons and Publix to round out the top five. Aldi has 2.8% of U.S. market share, according to Numerator data, which runs through the beginning of October 2025.Aldi, which is privately held, does not share financial results, but market research shows it's attracting more shoppers to its locations. Store traffic rose by more than 50% from 2019 to 2024, according to Placer.ai — an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate visits to locations — and commercial real estate firm JLL.Aldi's store traffic gains outpaced both the overall grocery sector and its major competitors in 2025, according to Placer.ai. Its store visits rose 8% year over year in 2025 from the prior year, compared with Costco's 5.9% growth, Albertsons' 1.6% increase, Kroger's 0.8% rise and Walmart's 0.5% growth. Store visits for the overall grocer sector increased 3.1% year over year.An Aldi grocery store on May 2, 2025, in Washington, DC, U.S.Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesResults from some of Aldi's competitors reflect their challenges. Last week, Albertsons gave a weak full-year forecast and its CEO, Susan Morris, said on the company's earnings call that even higher-income shoppers are \"becoming more conscious of price and value.\"Kroger, too, has acknowledged more competitive pressure. On an earnings call in early December, Kroger's interim CEO, Ron Sargent, stressed ways the company is trying to \"strengthening our competitive position,\" such as accelerating capital investment in new stores and lowering prices. He did not call out Aldi or other discounters by name.He said on the call that the retail environment is always \"very competitive,\" but said that's \"especially true today when consumers are looking for great value.\"Other value-focused grocers are growing, too. Lidl, another discounter heavy on private labels, relaunched in the U.S. in 2024 and has more than 190 stores across nine East Coast states. Walmart, for its part, has spoken about attracting more affluent shoppers from households that earn an annual income of more than $100,000 per year as it adds more fashion-forward and trend-driven brands. One of those is Bettergoods, a chef-driven private-label grocery line that it launched in 2024 with most items priced under $5.An Aldi supermarket in Alhambra, California, on June 27, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSmaller stores, fewer itemsAldi stands apart from rivals in a few key ways. It has smaller stores, a narrower selection of merchandise and a heavy emphasis on its own brand. More than 90% of its assortment and about the same of its total sales come from private-label items, a sharp difference from other grocers and big-box retailers that typically lean on national brands and household names like Heinz ketchup or General Mills' Cheerios.Nearly every aspect of its stores and strategy are designed for efficiency — it puts multiple bar codes on each item to speed up checkout and requires customers to bring or pay for their own bags. It's also famous for requiring customers to deposit a quarter for a shopping cart, which they get back when they return it. Some items are stored on shelves in cardboard boxes or on wood pallets. Scott Patton, chief commercial officer of Aldi U.S., said the smaller stores and curated merchandise save shoppers' time and allow them to skip the overwhelm of browsing a vast aisle with different types of ketchup or other items.Aldi stores are about 10,000 square feet. That's a tiny fraction of a Walmart supercenter's average size of 178,000 square feet, according to Walmart's annual report.Still, Patton said Aldi's smaller assortment includes creative flavors and trendy items, such as collagen-infused drink mixes, avocado oil and freeze-dried banana snacks. Plus, it offers a fun, \"treasure hunt\" experience, he said. In the middle of the store, Aldi shoppers can browse \"Aldi Finds\" — a mix of merchandise that's only available for a limited time. For example, at the beginning of this month, Aldi's store in New York City's Harlem neighborhood sold an electric glass tea kettle for $19.99, an air fryer for $39.99 and a Valentine's Day-themed plush throw blanket for $7.99. Items also included some recognized food brands, such as a 20-pack of Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers and a bottle of Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing.Yet Aldi's strategy of emphasizing private label and a rotating selection of random items can come with downsides, as it may not carry all of the products that a shopper has on their list. \"You might have to shop at another store and that's actually OK with us,\" Patton said. \"What we want our customers to do is shop Aldi first.\"The company has also faced lawsuits over its packaging. Chips Ahoy and Oreo parent company Mondelez sued Aldi last year, alleging that the discounter is copying the packaging of its competitors to confuse shoppers. Some of the boxes for its store-brand items have near identical colors and fonts as the competing product from national labels. Last year, Aldi revamped its store packaging — a move that Patton said \"was independent of any lawsuit or any infringement claims.\"Nearly every aspect of Aldi stores are designed for efficiency. Some items for sale at stores are still in cardboard boxes or on wood pallets.Melissa Repko | CNBCAldi loyalistsFor some loyal customers, Aldi's no-frills approach and private-label emphasis is an attraction. Emily Curtis, an actor and barista who lives in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood, heads to Aldi each week for a grocery run. She and her husband battle traffic for at least 30 minutes each way on a drive to and from Aldi's Harlem store. Curtis, 27, said she grew up in a frugal family where cereal choices were typically off-brand rather than Lucky Charms. She started shopping at Aldi when in college at the University of Alabama.\"When I was in school eating beans and rice, it was Aldi beans and rice,\" she said.Even as she moved to Georgia and then New York, she kept making regular visits to Aldi. When she and her husband first moved to New York City, they found that they saved money when shopping at the Aldi across town — even when tacking on Instacart delivery fees  — compared with buying from neighborhood grocers like D'Agostino and Gristedes. \"Prices are the main draw and that's why we go out of our way,\" she said.But, Curtis said she also likes the rotating items that she finds in Aldi's middle aisles. In her closet, she has Aldi sweatpants and even Aldi-themed Christmas sweaters. She keeps her kitchen utensils into a holder from Aldi. And she stocks up each year on a limited-time pumpkin tomato marinara sauce.\"It's become a personality trait, for better or worse, my undying devotion to the brand.\"— CNBC's Natalie Rice contributed to this report.",

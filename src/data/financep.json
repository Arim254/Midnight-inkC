    "body": "Wayfair store in Wilmette, Illinois.Courtesy: WayfairWayfair's annual sales grew last year for the first time since 2020 as the online furniture company continues to win over value-seeking consumers, the retailer announced Thursday. In 2025, Wayfair revenue grew 5.1% to $12.5 billion. The gains follow a more than 1% year-over-year decline in 2024.The e-commerce giant also beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter and delivered better-than-expected adjusted earnings as stronger sales flowed through to the business.\"Q4 capped off a tremendous year for Wayfair,\" said co-founder and CEO Niraj Shah. \"... We had our third consecutive quarter of new customer growth, on top of healthy growth in repeat orders, all in the face of a category that contracted in the low single digits for the final quarter of the year. 2025 was a year where we returned to growth and accelerated throughout the year through a number of organic business strategies that can compound for years to come.\"Despite the sales growth and better-than-expected results, Wayfair shares dropped more than 10% in premarket trading Thursday. Here's how Wayfair did in its fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 85 cents adjusted vs. 66 cents expectedRevenue: $3.34 billion vs. $3.30 billion expectedIn the three month period that ended Dec. 31, Wayfair reported a loss of $116 million, or 89 cents per share, compared with a loss of $128 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to equity-based compensation and other one-time charges, Wayfair saw earnings per share of 85 cents. For the second quarter in a row, Wayfair saw a meaningful gain in revenue. During the period, sales rose to $3.34 billion, up about 7% from $3.12 billion a year earlier. While Wayfair has not posted an annual net profit since 2020, it is making gains in its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. During the quarter, Wayfair posted adjusted EBITDA of $224 million, ahead of expectations of $200 million, according to StreetAccount. \"Ultimately, this is the culmination of the work throughout 2025, which I think was a really pivotal year for us in proving out both our share gain story and our profit story,\" finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. \"That resulted in both an incredibly strong quarter on the top line, where we continued to gain share despite a challenging macro, and then really nice flow through and significant growth on the adjusted EBITDA line.\" The company's return to revenue growth over the last two quarters has helped its profitability. If the sales trends continue, the company expects to see more improvements to its bottom line. Wayfair's growth comes during a challenging time for the furniture industry, when tariffs, high interest rates and sluggish home sales are weighing on demand for new couches and kitchen tables. Consumers are still spending on these goods, but instead prioritizing value and lower prices, which Wayfair is positioned to offer through its wide network of manufacturers. During the quarter, average order values increased to $301, up from $290 in the year-ago period, while the number of orders delivered grew at a similar pace. While prices have risen across the home goods sector, Wayfair's volume trends are in line with its order values. Over the last year, Wayfair has focused on improving its customer experience through its rewards program and initiatives like Wayfair verify, which stamps products that have the quality the company says it endorses. It also improved its website, said Gulliver. \"The combination of these customer facing initiatives, I think, has helped us take share in what we think was still quite a challenged category,\" said Gulliver.",

(Photo by Jung Yeon-Je - Pool/Getty Images)Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFormer South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to life imprisonment Thursday after being found guilty of leading an insurrection during his declaration of martial law in December 2024. The ruling, delivered by Seoul Central District Court Judge Jee Kui-youn, was lighter than the death penalty prosecutors sought at the trial's final hearing in January. The ruling was aired live on South Korea's major broadcasters.Jee said in the verdict that Yoon led an insurrection and committed acts to subvert the country's constitutional order.The court added that Yoon \"took the lead in planning the crime and involved a large number of people,\" and that it was \"difficult to see any sign of remorse from the defendant, who also refused to appear in court.\"Yoon had previously reportedly refused to appear in court for questioning last year. The court also found Yoon had ordered South Korea's military to capture individuals during the martial law declaration, including the current president Lee Jae Myung. Yoon also had the intention to \"paralyze\" the country's parliament by deploying troops to blockade the National Assembly and arrest key politicians, Jee said.Five others were also sentenced, including former defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison.The defendants may appeal the ruling within a week. The sentence follows a separate ruling on Jan. 16, when Yoon was given a five-year prison term for attempting to obstruct his arrest after he was impeached and suspended from office. Other senior officials have been sentenced over the failed martial law bid. Former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was sentenced to 23 years in prison, while former Interior Minister Lee Sang-min received a seven-year sentence.Yoon was the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested in an operation involving over 3,000 police personnel that involved a standoff with presidential security agents. Martial law attemptDuring the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports.Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, arguing the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"He imposed South Korea's first instance of martial law in 44 years during a late-night address on Dec. 3, claiming that the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea was engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"Troops were deployed to the country's National Assembly, while soldiers and police clashed with protesters outside the compound. Television footage showed special forces breaking windows to gain access to the chamber, while parliamentary staffers used furniture to barricade doors.Then-defense minister Kim Yong-hyun also reportedly ordered troops to \"pull people inside the National Assembly building outside.\"But the martial law order was overturned within three hours, after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers gathered in the chamber and unanimously voted to do so. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.He was impeached 11 days later and removed from office on April 4, 2025. ",

    "body": "The Etsy Inc. headquarters in the Brooklyn borough of New York on June 25, 2024.Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEtsy shares skyrocketed more than 14% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company announced eBay would acquire its secondhand clothing reseller Depop for about $1.2 billion in cash.The deal comes almost five years after Etsy bought Depop for roughly $1.62 billion, giving the online marketplace an edge into younger consumers who flocked to the U.K.-founded app to hawk their used clothing, shoes, accessories and other goods. About 90% of Depop's users are under the age of 34, Etsy said.\"We are excited that this transaction allows us to focus exclusively on the compelling opportunity we see in front of us: to grow the Etsy marketplace in ways that matter most to our buyers and sellers,\" Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. In recent years, Etsy snapped up several niche online marketplaces as part of a \"house of brands\" strategy to compete with bigger, faster-growing rivals like Amazon. But it's since unwound many of those deals, including Brazilian e-commerce company Elo7 in 2023 and musical instrument marketplace Reverb last year.Read more CNBC tech newsSnap to launch creator subscriptions in push to diversify revenueAlibaba unveils Qwen3.5 as China's chatbot race shifts to AI agentsByteDance says it will add safeguards to Seedance 2.0 following Hollywood backlashAnthropic got an 11% user boost from its OpenAI-bashing Super Bowl ad, data showsEtsy has struggled to grow its business since the pandemic e-commerce boom, while it contends with stiff competition from Amazon, Shopify and ultracheap online marketplaces like Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. On its core platform, Etsy saw active buyers and gross merchandise volume decline year over year in 2024, a trend that continued last year. The company has also borne the brunt of President Donald Trump's tariff policies and a tough macroeconomic environment that led to a pullback in discretionary spending among consumers. EBay CEO Jamie Iannone said Depop would allow the 30-year-old company to grow its presence in fashion.\"This acquisition presents an opportunity to advance one of our newest and fastest-growing Focus Categories with a marketplace that complements our existing presence, and enables us to reach a younger demographic across the expanding recommerce landscape,\" Iannone said in a statement.Shares of eBay surged more than 8% in extended trading following the news, which was announced alongside the company's fourth-quarter earnings results. EBay reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 on revenue of $2.97 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.34 per share and $2.88 billion, according to LSEG. Sales increased 15% from a year ago.Gross merchandise volume, or the dollar value of items sold, grew 10% year over year to $21.2 billion, above Wall Street expectations for $20.8 billion.For the first quarter, eBay said it expects to post adjusted earnings per share between $1.53 and $1.59 on revenue in the range of $3 billion and $3.05 billion.

It comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to address core U.S. demands during nuclear talks in Switzerland this week. Iran's foreign minister previously reported progress in the talks, saying the two countries had reached an understanding over the \"guiding principles\" for the negotiations.Speaking at a news briefing Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there were \"many reasons and arguments that once could make for a strike against Iran,\" noting that the two countries remain \"very far apart\" on some issues.The U.S. president had a \"very successful\" operation last June, Leavitt said, when U.S. stealth bombers struck three Iranian nuclear facilities as part of \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\"watch now\"The president has always been very clear though with respect to Iran or any country around the world, diplomacy is always his first option. And Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and this administration,\" Leavitt said.

That, of course, can still be signalling and pressure for a particular diplomatic outcome,\" James told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Thursday.\"But as more and more planes comes in and more and more equipment comes in, that signalling gets more and more expensive. And therefore, the payoff you want for it in diplomatic terms has to be larger — and there is simply no sign Tehran can offer the absolute minimum that Washington is likely to demand,\" she added.

They were on stage at the India AI Impact Summit, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, among others. Both had been keynote speakers.Modi had lifted Altman and Pichai's hands before an applauding crowd, with others following suit. However, Altman and Amodei, who were next to each other, raised their fists instead of holding hands with one another. It comes as competition intensifies between ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Claude maker Anthropic, with both vying for their models to become the default choice for consumers globally. The companies have also recently traded shots over the potential use of adverts in AI models.The image of Altman and Amodei opting out of holding hands quickly made the rounds on social media.Siddharth Bhatia, cofounder of AI startup Puch AI, posted on X: \"When AGI? The day Dario and Sam hold hands.\"Justine Moore, an investing partner at Andreesen Horowitz, shared a picture with the words: \"When you're forced to do a group project with your opp.\"Last month, Anthropic released Super Bowl commercials that poked fun at OpenAI's plan to start testing ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. Altman called the ads \"clearly dishonest,\" saying: \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"Anthropic's chief customer officer, Paul Smith, later told CNBC that it was focused on growing its business rather than making \"flashy headlines,\" in a veiled swipe at OpenAI.Speaking at the summit after the photo, Altman told CNBC: \"We still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best.\"Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI staff and researchers, including Amodei, who left the company after disagreements over its direction. The company has marketed itself as a \"safety-first\" alternative.OpenAI and Anthropic have since raised billions of dollars of capital as they've competed for users, enterprise customers and market share.During his speech at the summit on Thursday, Amodei discussed the \"serious risks\" associated with AI, including the autonomous behavior of AI systems, their potential misuse by individuals and governments, and the potential for economic displacement.During his speech, Altman argued that the industry's understanding of AI safety should include \"societal resilience,\" adding: \"We believe no AI lab can deliver a good future on their own.\"",

The administration has a slew of events planned for the 250th anniversary of the United States, culminating in Independence Day celebrations on July 4. Many of the events will take place in Washington, D.C., which sits on the Potomac, and are likely to draw crowds of travelers. Leavitt said the White House is still waiting on local governments in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to ask for federal help in cleaning up the mess. Trump has repeatedly blamed Democratic leadership in the two states and D.C. for the spill and has demanded they ask \"politely\" for federal assistance. Trump has singled out Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland over the spill. The president also recently snubbed Moore from a National Governors' Association event at the White House. Leavitt doubled down on the president's badgering of Moore on Wednesday.\"There has been no improvement under the leadership of Gov. Moore,\" Leavitt said. \"He's clearly shown he's incapable of fixing this problem, which is why President Trump and the federal government are standing by to step in.\"Leavitt's comments also add to a messy political fight that erupted this week over the spill, pitting Moore against Trump. Moore, who is the nation's only Black governor, a frequent Trump foil, and often floated as a potential presidential contender in 2028, has asserted the failed pipe is within the jurisdiction of federal authorities. President Donald Trump (L) and Maryland Gov. Wes MooreGetty Images | Reuters\"The sewage pipe that he is talking about is on federal land,\" Moore said Wednesday at a Maryland Board of Public Works meeting. \"And over these past four weeks, the Trump-Vance administration has failed to act.\"\"To blame Maryland in this when this is a D.C. pipe on federal land is asinine, it is disingenuous, absurd and politically motivated,\" Moore said.

It is part of the Potomac Interceptor sewer line and is located alongside the Clara Barton Parkway in Maryland, just outside of the capital city. At least 200 million gallons of wastewater flooded into the Potomac after the pipe breach. Moore on Wednesday also responded to Trump's demands for him and other local Democratic leaders to ask for help. \"If the president wants me to ask nicely, my response is this: please, Mr. President, do your job,\" Moore said. Leavitt said she would relay Moore's response to Trump and that the administration is drawing up plans to help in the recovery effort. \"I'll ask the President, and we will provide you with the next steps,\" Leavitt said at the Wednesday press briefing. \"But in all seriousness, the federal government has been preparing plans.\"",

    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in  Oceanside, California, U.S., May 15, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart said on Thursday that holiday-quarter sales rose nearly 6% and its quarterly earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street's expectations as gains in e-commerce, advertising and its third-party marketplace boosted its business.For the full current fiscal year, Walmart said it expects net sales to increase by 3.5% to 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.75 to $2.85. That earnings outlook fell short of Wall Street's expectations of $2.96 per share, according to LSEG. In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said speedy deliveries from stores are helping Walmart attract more shoppers, particularly those with higher incomes. \"Our ability to serve customers at the scale that we have, combined with the speed that we now have, is really translating into continued market share gains,\" he said.He said the company's market share gains cut across all incomes, but were larger among upper-income households. For example, with fashion, a category that grew by a mid-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter, almost all of that increase came from households with an annual income over $100,000, he said.In the coming months, Rainey said he expects price increases from inflation and President Donald Trump's tariff hikes to ease. Food inflation at Walmart in the fourth quarter was just above 1%, while it was slightly higher for general merchandise, he said.\"It seems to be a little bit more of a normalized price environment,\" he said. \"I think we have, largely as a retail industry, absorbed or seen the brunt of the impact from tariffs.\"While that comment is welcome news to many U.S. shoppers who buy at the country's largest grocer, it may be too early to say what pricing trends at the retailer mean for the rest of the economy. Though Walmart is viewed as a key barometer for the wider retail industry, it traditionally has had more power than its competitors to keep prices low in part because of its scale. Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal fourth quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 74 cents adjusted vs. 73 cents expectedRevenue:  $190.66 billion vs. $190.43 billion expectedShares of Walmart were down about 3% in premarket trading. Yet as of Wednesday's close, shares of the company have climbed about 22% over the past year and about 14% so far this year. That's outpaced the S&P 500′s 12% gains over the past year and less than 1% gains year to date.Walmart's results Thursday also show an inflection point in the industry. For the first time, Amazon topped Walmart as the largest retailer by annual revenue, as the company posted $716.9 billion in sales for its most recent fiscal year compared with $713.2 billion for Walmart. The companies aren't an exact comparison, as Amazon gets a sizeable piece of its revenue from cloud computing and other tech services. Yet it underscores the competition between the two rivals, particularly as Walmart follows a similar playbook by growing revenue streams outside of brick-and-mortar retail, like from ads and its marketplace.In the three-month period that ended Jan. 31, Walmart's net income decreased to $4.24 billion, or 53 cents per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items like investment gains and losses, legal settlements and business reorganization, Walmart's adjusted earnings per share were 74 cents.Revenue rose from $180.55 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales jumped 4.6% for Walmart's U.S. business and 4% for Sam's Club in the fourth quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.Walmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 27% compared with the year-ago period, fueled by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery of online orders,, along with the retailer's third-party marketplace. That marked the company's 15th straight quarter of double-digit digital gains. Global e-commerce sales increased 24% year over year.For the company's U.S. business, e-commerce accounted for 23% of sales – a record high for Walmart. The digital growth in the quarter included an approximately 50% gain in store-fulfilled deliveries and a roughly 41% increase in sales from Walmart Connect, its advertising business, the company said.Walmart's quarterly report marked the first under its new CEO John Furner. Furner, the former Walmart U.S. CEO and a more than three-decade company veteran, succeeded Doug McMillon as Walmart's top executive on Feb. 1.Investors largely expect Furner to focus on similar priorities as his predecessor McMillon, such as increasing Walmart's online business, attracting more customers across incomes and ramping up higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace and advertising.Along with getting a new CEO, Walmart has hit other milestones lately. Its stock switched to the tech-heavy Nasdaq in December and its market value hit $1 trillion earlier this month.Along with its results Thursday, Walmart also announced a new $30 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing a $20 billion buyback program approved in 2022.As of Wednesday's close, shares of the company have climbed about 22% over the past year and about 14% so far this year. That's outpaced the S&P 500′s 12% gains over the past year and less than 1% gains year to date.",

    "body": "A researcher works in the lab at the Moderna headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, March 26, 2024.Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesModerna said on Wednesday that the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to review its experimental mRNA flu shot, reversing the agency's earlier decision to refuse to accept the application in a move that stunned Wall Street and the medical community. The announcement clears a path forward for the vaccine, which is key to Moderna's experimental combination Covid-flu jab and the company's goal of breaking even by 2028. The FDA is slated to make a decision on the flu shot on Aug. 5, which would enable Moderna to make the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. \"Pending FDA approval, we look forward to making our flu vaccine available later this year so that America's seniors have access to a new option to protect themselves against flu,\" said Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel in a release. Shares of the biotech company rose more than 6% on Wednesday. Moderna said it had a \"constructive\" meeting with the FDA and proposed a revised regulatory approach that addresses criticisms the agency made when refusing to accept the application last week, tailoring its new proposal to an older population.Under the new approach, Moderna is seeking full approval for the shot in adults ages 50 to 64 and an accelerated approval of the shot for people 65 and up. The latter means that upon approval, Moderna will have to conduct an additional post-marketing study in older adults to confirm the vaccine's benefits. In a statement, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that the FDA has accepted the modified application.The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot in a Phase 3 trial, arguing that it \"does not reflect the best-available standard of care\" in the U.S. The FDA's previous feedback expressed a preference for Moderna to use a higher-dose vaccine for older adults as a comparator in the trial.In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday before the announcement, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary did not indicate that the agency would reverse course. But he emphasized that the FDA reviewed the application and the initial late-stage trial on the shot when it came in, so \"it's a little bit of a misnomer to say that it was not looked at.\"Makary said the agency's guidance to Moderna on its mRNA-based flu shot \"was pretty clear.\" He said the FDA recommended that the group of participants ages 65 and up in the study who didn't take Moderna's shot receive the \"standard of care, not the substandard of care\" as a comparison product. Moderna has disputed that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. The company also said it was inconsistent with the FDA's prior written communication about the trial design, even before the study began, where the agency said using the standard flu shot would be \"acceptable.\"The saga follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy and regulation over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Moderna last week said the decision specifically stemmed from the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots without evidence. Last week, Moderna released a so-called Refusal to File letter from the FDA that was signed by Prasad on Feb. 3. HHS does not typically share those letters, and the agency has not provided any details on who drove the decision-making on the company's application. When asked about his stance on mRNA technology, which Kennedy and some of his supporters have criticized as unsafe, Makary told CNBC on Wednesday that he's \"hopeful and optimistic\" about the platform but would also \"like to see the data.\" \"We're not going to get ahead of the game,\" he said. \"We're going to basically say, we'd like to see the data, how far mRNA technology can be applied is a question where we'd love to see it applied, as far as it can be applied, but it's got to meet our scientific standards, so we'll see what it gets with cancer, with other infectious diseases. ...\"",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 28, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDivided Federal Reserve officials at their January meeting indicated that further interest rate cuts should be paused for now and could resume later in the year only if inflation cooperates.While the decision to hold the central bank's benchmark rate steady mostly was met with approval, the path ahead appeared less certain, with members conflicted between fighting inflation and supporting the labor market, according to minutes released Wednesday from the Jan. 27-28 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\"In considering the outlook for monetary policy, several participants commented that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation were to decline in line with their expectations,\" the meeting summary said.However, meeting participants disagreed on where policy should head, with officials debating over whether the focus should be more on fighting inflation or supporting the labor market.\"Some participants commented that it would likely be appropriate to hold the policy rate steady for some time as the Committee carefully assesses incoming data, and a number of these participants judged that additional policy easing may not be warranted until there was clear indication that the progress of disinflation was firmly back on track,\" the minutes said.Moreover, some even entertained the notion that rate hikes could be on the table and wanted the post-meeting statement to more closely reflect \"a two-sided description of the Committee's future interest rate decisions.\"Such a description would have reflected \"the possibility that upward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate could be appropriate if inflation remains at above-target levels.\"The Fed reduced its benchmark borrowing rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in consecutive cuts in September, October and December. Those moves put the key rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%.The meeting was the first for a new voting cast of regional presidents, at least two of whom, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland, have publicly said they think they Fed should be on hold indefinitely. Both have said they see inflation as a continuing threat and should be the focus of policy now. All 19 governors and regional presidents participate at the meeting, but only 12 vote.With the Fed already split along ideological lines, the fissure could grow deeper if former Governor Kevin Warsh is confirmed as the next central bank chair. Warsh has spoken in favor of lower rates, a position also supported by current Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller. Both Waller and Miran voted against the January decision, preferring instead another quarter-point cut. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.The meeting minutes do not identify individual participants and featured an array of characterizations to describe positions, rotating between \"some,\" \"a few,\" \"many\" and even featured two rare references to \"a vast majority.\"Participants generally expected inflation to come down through the year, \"though the pace and timing of this decline remained uncertain.\" They noted the impact tariffs were having on prices and said they expected the impact to wane as the year goes by.\"Most participants, however, cautioned that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective might be slower and more uneven than generally expected and judged that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee's objective was meaningful,\" the document said.At the meeting, the rate-setting FOMC adjusted some of the language in its post-meeting statement. The changes noted that the risks to inflation and the labor market had come more closely into balance, softening prior worries over the employment picture.Since the meeting, labor data has been a mixed bag, with indications that private sector job creation is slowing further and that the meager growth is coming almost entirely from the health-care sector. However, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.3% in January and nonfarm payroll growth was stronger than expected.On inflation, the Fed's key personal consumption expenditures prices metric has been mired around 3%. However, a report last week showed that the consumer price index when excluding food and energy prices was at its lowest in nearly five years.Futures traders are placing the best bet for the next cut to come in June, with another in September or October, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.",

Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.U.S. President Donald Trump has since pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies Havana with oil and labeled its government as \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" earlier in the month.'Very dramatic changes'Cuba's government, which has condemned the U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.It also suspended an annual cigar festival which had been due to take place in Havana later this month, without providing details of a new date. Photos of daily life in Cuba have shown piles of waste building on Havana's street corners in recent days as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks.A bicitaxi rides past garbage piled up on a street in Havana on February 17, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government. \"They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.",

    "body": "Nestle shares rose 3% Thursday after the maker of Nescafé and KitKat reported organic sales growth for the fourth quarter that beat analyst forecasts.The closely watched organic sales growth rate came in at 4%, beating a FactSet consensus of 3.55%. For 2026, Nestle said it is targeting organic sales growth of 3% to 4%, along with an improvement in its underlying trading operating profit margin, which stood at 16.1% in 2025.The Vevey, Switzerland-based company also announced it was planning to sell its remaining ice cream business to Haagen-Dazs owner Froneri, a joint venture by PAI and Nestle. In addition, Nestle said it started the formal process to shed its water business earlier in the first quarter, and expects the business, which holds brands such as Henniez and Perrier to be deconsolidated by 2027. Shares were last trading up 2.6% and the stock is up around 2% so far this year.watch nowThe company, under its new leadership duo of CEO Philipp Navratil and Chairman Pablo Isla, a former Inditex executive, have been focusing on streamlining the sprawling consumer giant, after years of operational and share-price underperformance. \"We are accelerating our strategy. We are focusing our portfolio on four businesses, led by our strongest brands, with prioritized resources and a simplified organization,\" Navratil said in a statement.The CEO later told analysts that the remaining ice cream business was \"strong, but small and a distraction\" for the company.Nestle's portfolio plans were \"little changed and undramatic for now,\" analysts at Jefferies said. They noted that there had been some anticipation and uncertainty ahead of the earnings report, but the CEO had left most key ambitions unchanged.UBS wrote in a note that the results reflected early signs of progress while pointing to the strength of confectionery, beverages and petcare as being the biggest drivers of growth in the fourth quarter. An infant formula recall, which has also engulfed rival Danone and privately held Lactalis in France, has provided a stumbling block for restoring trust in the business. Nestle said Thursday its organic growth guidance includes a negative 20 basis point impact from the recall and flagged 1.7 billion Swiss francs in restructuring items, mainly due to the recall. ",

    "body": "The Gateway Tunnel site near W. 30th St. and 11th Ave. in Hudson Yards, Manhattan on Oct. 23, 2025. Barry Williams | New York Daily News | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Wednesday released the rest of the funds it had been withholding for the construction of a major rail tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday.The federal government freed up the remaining $98 million due for the Gateway project that is increasing passenger rail capacity into Manhattan, as well as an additional $30 million in reimbursements for work that had been completed in January, Hochul said in a statement.The frozen funds were released in tranches over nearly two weeks after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding the money for the project that began construction in 2023. In compliance with that Feb. 6 order, the administration released $30 million on Feb. 13, followed by an additional $77 million earlier this week.The funding suspension, initiated on the eve of the Oct. 1 government shutdown, this month triggered a total work stoppage that threatened nearly 1,000 employees' jobs.Contractors are now being told to prepare to resume construction next week, the Democratic governor said in Wednesday's statement.\"Today's progress is significant, but we need certainty that Gateway funding will remain in place for the duration of the project,\" Hochul said. \"The federal government has a legal obligation to fully fund Gateway, and New York will accept nothing less.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from airJust two days earlier, President Donald Trump had slammed the project as a \"future boondoggle,\" claiming in a Truth Social post that it will cost \"many BILLIONS OF DOLLARS more than projected or anticipated.\"The federal government will not be responsible for any cost overruns associated with the $16 billion project, Trump asserted. In the same post, he denied reports that he had offered to release Gateway's federal funding on the condition that New York's Penn Station be renamed after himself. The station is named for its builder and original occupant — the Pennsylvania Railroad.\"These funds should never have been withheld in the first place,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who had sued the Trump administration in conjunction with New Jersey acting Attorney General Jennifer Davenport.\"I am thrilled that hardworking New Yorkers can now get back on the job and move forward with the most important infrastructure project in the country,\" James said in a press release. \"We will remain vigilant to ensure this funding continues uninterrupted, so that workers and commuters are never again left in limbo by the president's targeted and unlawful whims.\"The Hudson River tunnel project is the most important piece of the Gateway program, which aims to renovate a slew of public infrastructure in New York and New Jersey.The existing rail tunnel, known as the North River Tunnel, carries 200,000 passengers under the Hudson every day. It was constructed 116 years ago and was in need of repair even before 2012's Superstorm Sandy significantly damaged it, officials say.The Gateway project would fix the existing tunnel and create a new rail tunnel with two tracks connecting to Penn Station. The federal government and New York and New Jersey are funding the tunnel project. Amtrak has also committed over $1 billion to the project.",

    "body": "David Solomon, CEO Goldman Sachs, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22nd, 2026. \nOscar Molina | CNBCGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday \"it is very, very important that we codify a rule-based system\" for how cryptocurrency and related financial instruments will operate\" in the United States.\"As an American, I think it is very important that as we put legislation in place, we get it right for the long term,\" Solomon told CNBC's Sara Eisen during an interview in front of attendees at the World Liberty Forum at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., which was hosted by the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.\"I believe that to operate markets safely and soundly, we need to have a rules-based system,\" said Solomon, whose firm is one of the world's premier traditional investment banks. \"Our banking system is unique, and our banking system needs to coexist with this technological innovation.\"\"If there are people who think we are going to operate in this environment without rules, they are probably wrong, and they should move to El Salvador,\" Solomon said. The CEO was echoing a comment that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made during testimony on Feb. 5 to the Senate Banking Committee backing a cryptocurrency market bill structure bill, the CLARITY Act.El Salvador's government has purchased bitcoin since 2022. Because of the decline in bitcoin's price, the value of El Salvador's holdings of that cryptocurrency has fallen to about $500 million, down from a high of $800 million last year.Solomon commented weeks after a Senate committee advanced the CLARITY ACT, which would create a national regulatory structure for crypto.That bill has stalled over a dispute about whether digital asset companies would be allowed to offer customers rewards, or payments on stablecoins that are held in those companies. Banks have opposed such rewards, which could compete with their interest payments on depositors' accounts.\"We have to get this CLARITY Act across the finish line,\" Bessent said during his testimony at the Banking Committee after Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., asked his opinion on the importance of having \"clear rules of the road\" for cryptocurrency in the U.S.Solomon said Wednesday that he is \"super-interested in\" crypto-related business.Read more CNBC politics coverageBillionaire Les Wexner's congressional deposition over Jeffrey Epstein ties is underwayTrump administration sued for Stonewall Pride flag removal in New YorkPotomac River sewage spill: Trump says Democrats need to ask for his helpStephen Colbert says CBS blocked James Talarico interview from air\"We obviously are doing a bunch of things around digitization and tokenization,\" he said.\"We touch all that stuff,\" Solomon said.But, he added, \"it doesn't mean it's central to what we do. These kinds of assets are still a small percentage\" of Goldman's business.\"We have clients, our clients have needs, we're here to serve our clients.\"Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, earlier Wednesday at the conference, told Eisen on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he still has \"some concerns\" about the crypto market structure bill, but \"hopefully by April\" it will be passed by Congress and be able to be signed by President Donald Trump.Moreno brushed aside concerns that if the bill is not passed soon, it could die because of the chance that Democrats would regain majority control of the Senate and House of Representatives. Republicans are increasingly fearful they will lose control of at least the House in November's midterm elections.\"The House isn't going to go Democrat, and neither is the Senate,\" Moreno predicted.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, when asked about the crypto bill, said \"there is now a path forward where we can get a win-win-win outcome here: a win for the crypto industry, and a win for the banks, and a win for the American consumer to get President Trump's crypto agenda through to the finish line so we can make America the crypto capital of the world.\"",

The San Jose-based company reported financials after the bell Tuesday, posting an adjusted earnings per share of $1.99 on revenue of $1.44 billion in the fourth-quarter of 2025, about 6% higher versus the prior year on both measures.Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting an EPS of $1.91 and revenue of $1.42 billion.CEO Anirudh Devgan told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday that about 45% of its business is now coming from what he called \"system companies,\" which include hyperscalers and end producers of phones and cars.\"System companies want to optimize the hardware and software stack together, and one way to do that is the critical component, is designing their own chips that are optimized to their workload,\" Devgan said. Cadence Design Systems has been riding a wave of artificial intelligence-related capital expenditures and research and development efforts by a range of tech enterprises working to create large language models and infuse them into their internal and customer-facing apps and products.Devgan pointed to Apple's efforts with their own smartphone chips, and Google's custom AI silicon as leading examples, and said the trend of system companies doing their own chips \"is only going to accelerate,\" he said.The company said it expects $5.9 billion to $6 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year, at the top end of FactSet's $5.94 billion expectation.Cadence competes with other companies that sell chip design software, including Synopsys and Siemens.Read more CNBC tech newsSnap to launch creator subscriptions in push to diversify revenueAlibaba unveils Qwen3.5 as China's chatbot race shifts to AI agentsByteDance says it will add safeguards to Seedance 2.0 following Hollywood backlashAnthropic got an 11% user boost from its OpenAI-bashing Super Bowl ad, data shows",

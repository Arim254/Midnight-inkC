    "body": "When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: \"What's wrong?\"It's well-intentioned and it comes from care. But after years of teaching conscious parenting and studying over 200 kids, I've seen how often that question does the opposite of what parents hope. Instead of opening children up, it can shut them down.Emotional intelligence develops when children feel safe enough to reflect. Without that foundation, even the most caring questions can feel overwhelming in the moment.Across my research, one sentence reliably helped children pause, reflect, and communicate more openly: \"Tell me what feels hard right now.\"This magic phrase works because it matches how children actually experience emotions in real life. Rather than pushing for clarity or explanations, it creates the conditions where insight can emerge naturally.1. It reduces defensiveness before the conversation even beginsDuring meltdowns, after-school emotional releases, or moments of sudden irritability, children are already on edge. The word \"hard\" feels human and non-threatening. It signals to your child that they aren't in trouble and don't need to justify their feelings, making it easier to stay engaged instead of shutting down or pushing back.2. It allows emotional language to develop organicallyChildren don't need to label emotions precisely. They can describe a situation, a sensation, or a moment that felt overwhelming. Over time, this gently expands emotional language, allowing insight to develop naturally rather than being forced before a child has the words.3. It establishes emotional safety before problem-solvingBefore problem-solving, before advice, before correction, this phrase tells a child: \"I can handle what you're feeling.\" Emotional intelligence grows in welcoming environments where emotions are met with steadiness instead of urgency.4. It gives children agency over what they shareRather than demanding an explanation, this question invites reflection. The child decides how much to share and when, reinforcing a sense of agency over their emotional experience, which is an essential foundation for self-regulation and confidence.5. It helps calm the nervous system firstWhen children feel emotionally safe, their stress response begins to settle. This phrase is especially effective when behavior feels disproportionate or confusing because it prioritizes regulation before reasoning.6. It normalizes emotions as part of everyday lifeBy focusing on what feels hard, parents communicate that emotions can be noticed without being rushed or fixed. It teaches kids that feelings can be experienced and moved through rather than avoided or suppressed.7. It demonstrates emotional intelligence in real timeChildren learn emotional intelligence through experience, not instruction. When parents respond with calm curiosity instead of control or urgency, they model how to approach emotions with steadiness and reflection. These are skills children eventually apply to themselves.Our job as parents is to create an environment where our children feel safe sharing their inner worlds. When you adjust your language, you shape the emotional tone of your relationship. Over time, children learn that their feelings are important signals that deserve attention.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Many people think that if they're determined enough — if they push themselves really hard — they'll be able to create better habits.Those people are missing an important piece to the puzzle of self-control, according to James Clear, author of The New York Times bestselling book \"Atomic Habits.\" Even if you're disciplined, you likely need to put yourself in environments that allow you to stay that way, free of distractions or opportunities to be tempted out of your habits-in-progress, Clear told \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\" in a Jan. 8 episode.\"When you look at people who exhibit high levels of self-control, the common pattern across them is not that they have higher discipline than the average person,\" he said. \"The common pattern is that they are in situations where they're tempted less frequently.\"If you're avoiding alcohol while doing Dry January for the first time, for example, you may not want to go to happy hour with your friends, where external pressures or fear of missing out could sway you. The goal is to stay away from temptation, not resist it.\"You don't need to try to be more disciplined. You don't need to wish that you were a person with more willpower,\" said Clear. \"You need to take a little bit of time to design an environment where you're not tempted as frequently ... That could mean simple things like not having chips in the house or not having cigarettes in the house or things like that.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsYour environment can include the people you surround yourself with: Keeping company with likeminded individuals can help you stay focused, some studies show. If you and your friends are regularly in situations that keep you from building your desired habit, you might want to speak transparently with them about your goals or find other ways to spend time with them, Clear recommended.\"And that's not necessarily saying I never see these people again, but maybe I only see them in pockets or in certain situations,\" Clear said. \"And then other people I'm trying to expose myself to more and hang out with more.\"You may be inclined to tell yourself that, if you mess up during your pursuit for better habits, you should just quit trying altogether. Instead, flip your self-talk to be more optimistic, Clear advised. Tell yourself that your efforts today will pay off down the line, for example, or that you can stay the course even if you slip up.A positive attitude can also help you better manage the stress that comes with lifestyle and habit changes, according to a 2023 report from the Mayo Clinic. \"A bad attitude and self-pity makes every problem harder,\" said Clear. \"And so you're just layering on another challenge to the already challenging situation.

    "body": "Bozoma Saint John doesn't shrink away from the spotlight.Saint John, 48, was Netflix's first Black C-level executive as their chief marketing officer. She became Uber's first chief branding officer tasked with rehabbing the rideshare company's image. And she made headlines in 2016 when she shook up the stage at Apple's annual conference despite not looking like a typical \"Apple fan boy,\" she says.Saint John's career moves are as as bold as her personal style. And she has what she considers some well-meaning but misguided advice to thank for that.\"An early manager told me never to wear red lipstick or red nail polish,\" Saint John tells CNBC Make It when asked about the best career advice she's ever gotten.\"She did it with good intention, like, 'You walk into a room and you don't want to be too bold. You don't want people to make opinions of you before you even open your mouth,'\" Saint John says. But \"that made me question my appearance in rooms. Being a Black woman who's quite tall and bold in her wardrobe, I found that it really shrank me.\"Saint John says she decided to ignore that advice and flip it on its head to \"be the most colorful, the boldest, the sharpest, the wittiest in a room, and feel very confident in it.\"\"I've been able to be successful because I didn't take that advice,\" she says.Saint John continues to go after big changes in her career, becoming a first-time CEO for her own hair and beauty brand, Eve by Boz, and most recently adding \"reality TV star\" to her resume a cast member of Bravo's \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" and as co-host of NBC's \"On Brand with Jimmy Fallon.\"And she wants you to go after your big career swings, too.With people approaching a new year with new work goals, Saint John says it's a good time as any to go after what you really want in your career. \"That the pivot can happen any moment,\" she says.Here, Saint John draws on her own career and experience managing thousands to share the signs it's time to quit a job, how to shape your professional brand, a major red flag when interviewing with companies, and more.When you know it's time to quit a jobMy advice is usually if you get the Sunday scaries, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you are coming back from the holiday and you feel the ache in your stomach that you don't want to go back to your job, or you're dreading it so much so that you can barely sleep, then I think that's a pretty big indication that you've got to go now.The big mistake people when going after a raise, promotion or quittingIf you want a promotion or more experiences within your job, set a timeline by which you can hit that goal or decide it's time to leave. Create a timeline with your boss.A lot of times people approach that promotion or the raise conversation from a very self-centered standpoint. What the company and your manager wants to hear is how it's going to help the company and the wider community of your colleagues.So if you position it as: \"By March 1, I want to be promoted to X position, and this is how I'm going to execute my job to get take on more responsibility or help the company achieve X, Y and Z goal,' that gives you some building blocks and a timeline to get to March 1. When you're mid-career trying to get to the next step, you should absolutely have a plan to make sure that you're talking to your boss with a timeline in mind.It's such a mistake to think that this is all you, that you've got to put in the ideas for how you're going to get ahead. If you don't include your manager in your timeline, they have no idea what what goal you're trying to hit.Lay the groundwork so that by the time you have that conversation, everybody is well aware that either you've hit the goal to get that raise or promotion, and if you do your part and don't have it by March 1, everybody's on the same page: 'I'm quitting.'How to be in control of your own professional brandRegardless of if you're on TV or you're sitting in a cubicle, I believe your personal brand  is important, and to some degree you don't have control. So you have to take as much control as possible. If you're sitting a cubicle in an open floor plan and somebody doesn't appreciate your work, your responsibility is to make sure that the brand narrative about yourself is that you're hardworking or that you're creative or that you're a problem solver. Do as much as you can to communicate that brand the same way that you would in front of a camera.The No. 1 quality she hires forThis is the No. 1 thing: Bring your full self. Don't try to cut down the edges of yourself so that you can fit in better. The way that you make yourself memorable is to actually be memorable. There are so many beautifully unique things about each of us, our experiences, the history that we come with, that weaving that into your answers and into the conversation that you're having is actually what's going to make somebody remember you.We often think that as human beings, we have to have similar interests or similar tastes with somebody so that they get along with us and want to hire us. And I think it's actually quite the opposite. Curiosity, wanting to know somebody because you're like, 'They're from this place, or they've had this experience, and that could add to the job because I don't have that experience' is actually how you want to be perceived in an interview. Her biggest red flag to look for when interviewing with a companyIf you're in an interview, and the person who's talking to you makes it sound as if they're looking for somebody who's just like them, run. Run fast, far and away.You want to be in a place that is going to appreciate and love the unique contribution that you're bringing to the job. And it's not just about your business experience. It's about your cultural experience, your personal experience and your emotional experience. You're one of one, so bring it.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Jack Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of Airwallex.Courtesy of Jack ZhangThe word \"burnout\" isn't in the dictionary of Jack Zhang, co-founder and CEO of fintech company Airwallex.\"I never understand that terminology to be honest. I've worked 100 hours a week from [the] age of 16 for 20 plus years,\" Zhang told CNBC Make It.For Zhang, hard work meant survival. At age 15, he moved away from his hometown of Qingdao, China to Melbourne, Australia alone, to pursue better opportunities. He barely spoke English and stayed with an Australian host family. Shortly after arriving, he learned that his parents had found themselves in financial hot water back in China, and that he would have to support himself through university.\"I [had] two choices: either I just return to China and try to go back to the education system there, or I continue to stay in Australia and figure out how to pay [for my] tuition and living [expenses] on my own,\" said Zhang. He decided to stick with the latter and took whatever work he could find to make ends meet. To pay for his computer science degree at the University of Melbourne, Zhang juggled four blue-collar jobs: washing dishes at a restaurant during the day, bartending in the evening, working the overnight shift at a petrol station and packing lemons in a factory over the summer. Some weeks, he says, he clocked 80 to 100 hours of work on top of his coursework.\"When you're ... in that tough situation [where] you need to survive, you're not really [thinking] about burnout. I mean, either you survive or not, right?\" he said. Not much has changed since then. Now in his 40s, Zhang still clocks 80 hours a week \"easily,\" he said, at his own fintech firm. As of December 2025, the company is valued at $8 billion.From blue collar to millionaireAfter graduating from university in 2007, Zhang went into the corporate world. His first job was at an insurance company called Aviva, before he entered the banking industry.At the same time, he also built a few side businesses, from a shipping company where he exported olive oils and red wines from Australia to parts of Asia, to a real estate development firm. His side hustles proved lucrative. By the time he reached his 20s, money was no longer an issue. However, although he had accumulated millions through his businesses and banking career, Zhang said he had yet to find his true passion. Everything changed when he had his daughter at age 30. \"I remember I just looked at her, I [felt] like, I hadn't done anything [to] make her feel proud. And I think that's the moment I [decided] I need to stop just doing these side hustles, and I need to retire from my full time job and do something big, properly,\" said Zhang.\"I realized that while I always wanted money, money alone doesn't bring [me] the highest level of happiness,\" he added. Instead, he said he wanted to build something that he was extremely passionate about. \"I always wanted to find something [where] no one needs to ever wake me up and ... every day I feel extremely passionate, obligated, and willing to devote my entire survival towards,\" said Zhang. So, in December 2015, he quit his banking job and started the next chapter of his life.Starting AirwallexThe idea for Airwallex stemmed from one of Zhang's side hustles, a Melbourne-based coffee shop that he ran alongside his co-founder and university friend, Max Li. As part of running that business, the two would often import coffee beans and supplies from places like China and Brazil, which required them to wire money overseas. Through this process, they realized how expensive and inefficient cross-border payments and transfers were through the traditional SWIFT system. \"We thought, why can't we build a ... payment system in parallel to SWIFT and fundamentally change how money moves around the world?\" said Zhang. They wanted to create a solution to streamline cross-border payments, and thus, the original idea for Airwallex was born. Zhang and Li went on to bring together other friends from their university network to help work on the idea: Lucy Liu, Jacob Dai and Ki-lok Wong. Liu played a key role early on and invested the first $1 million into the startup. By late 2015, the group officially founded Airwallex. After about a decade of more 80-hour work weeks, as of end last year, the company crossed $1 billion in annualized run rate revenue (ARR), which estimates a company's future yearly earnings based on a shorter period of financial data.\"I'm still very excited about what's ahead of us,\" said Zhang. \"I think there's tons of opportunities ahead of us ... we think we can generate [at least] $10 billion [in] revenue by 2030 so that is our next goal post.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

South Korea is scheduled to announce its gross domestic product (GDP) figures on April 24. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFancy some cheese-flavored spicy noodles? Judging by export sales, the rest of the world can't get enough of South Korea's food exports, also known as \"K-Food.\"Exports of \"K-Food+\" — a category that includes food products and agricultural industries — surged to a record $13.62 billion in 2025, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. That's a 5.1% increase from a year earlier and marked the tenth consecutive year of growth.Instant noodles, or ramyeon, were the standout. Exports jumped nearly 22% to $1.52 billion, making it the first single food category to surpass $1 billion in overseas sales.Cheese-flavored spicy noodles and other new products resonated with consumers in China, the U.S., and emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East.\"Global demand for Korean noodles continues to expand, and companies have scaled up production and stabilized supply chains to meet it,\" the ministry noted in a late‑2025 report.Other categories also gained traction overseas, with Korean sauces benefiting from the demand for spicy and sweet flavors, while ice cream and fruit exports rose too.Riding K-pop's coattailsWhat makes the humble pack of South Korean instant noodles so popular? Analysts say culture plays a big role.The massive appeal of K-pop and Korean television dramas has helped fuel demand, with food frequently featured on screen. Characters are often shown eating ramyeon in dramas, variety shows and advertisements.Just as K-pop companies are looking overseas for growth, Korean food makers, especially those selling ramyeon, are doing the same, said Oh Jiwoo, analyst at brokerage CGS International.Nongshim CEO Cho Yong-chul told employees at the start of 2026 that the company's business principle for the year was \"Global Agility & Growth,\" urging staff to expand its overseas footprint.Otoki CEO Hwang Sung-man said at a shareholder meeting in March 2025 that the company, best known for its Jin Ramen, would prioritize \"exploring global markets\" and aim for an overseas sales revenue of 1.1 trillion won ($746 million) by 2030. CGS' Oh said companies are looking beyond South Korea's shores because the domestic market is saturated. For example, Nongshim, best known for its Shin Ramyeon brand, holds over 60% market share in South Korea. \"Their main product was first invented in 1970s and 80s. And those products, [the] same products, is selling every year, [with] no marketing cost,\" she said.South Korea's demographic decline also limits long-term domestic growth, Oh added, pushing companies to look abroad. As a result, noodle makers have leaned into K-pop's global reach, signing popular ambassadors and icons to increase their overseas appeal. Nongshim named SM Entertainment girl group Aespa as global ambassadors in late 2025, following a collaboration with Netflix on a K-pop Demon Hunters-themed noodle line. Otoki has tapped BTS member Jin as its brand model for Jin Ramen.

Beyond a saturated market, South Korea's instant noodle manufacturers face government-imposed limits on price increases, restricting their ability to offset rising costs, Macquarie said.Overseas markets, on the other hand, allow companies to set higher average selling prices, Oh said. She added that in China and other Asian markets, average prices can be 30%-50% higher than in South Korea, while in the U.S., average prices can be roughly double.Macquarie said that the dominant Japanese and Korean brands have benefited from shifting consumption patterns due to their focus on \"product innovation and cultivating a premium brand image.\"Samyang Foods was identified as a key beneficiary, with Macquarie projecting it will be able to increase its U.S. market share to 23.9% by 2028, from the current 11.4%. \"We believe premium instant noodles with strong product innovation will be the key driver for US market,\" Macquarie said.Samyang Foods is known for its Buldak line of spicy instant noodles, which gained popularity in 2014 for the \"fire noodle challenge,\" in which participants tried to eat the noodles without drinking water.The trend led to regulatory scrutiny in 2024 when Danish authorities briefly recalled some Buldak products over high capsaicin levels, which posed a serious health risk. The recall was later reversed.SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - JUNE 17: The Anjum family, on vacation from Pakistan, picks out varieties of the Buldak Samyang instant noodles from the CU \"Ramyun Library\" convenience store, a popular tourist attraction, on Monday, June 17, 2024, in the Hongdae district of Seoul, South Korea.\n(Photo by Jintak Han/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images",

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "body": "Signage at the Broadcom Inc. headquarters in San Jose, California, June 2, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInvestors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks.Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.BroadcomThis week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393.The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are \"hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon.\"While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted.Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to \"many many millions\" in 2026. He added that TPU v8 shipments are expected to touch hundreds of thousands of units per month in a few months, and millions by the end of this year. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today.Rasgon ranks No. 120 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 30.7%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks. AirbnbTravel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. In his research note on the outlook for the U.S. internet space, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as one of the top ideas for 2026. The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $156. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153.Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market.\"We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership,\" said Walmsley.The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals.Walmsley expects the hotel expansion, along with the book now, pay later conversion benefits, to reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2026 and lift ABNB stock's valuation multiple.Walmsley ranks No. 158 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Airbnb Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Meta PlatformsWalmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. The top-rated analyst reiterated a buy rating on META stock with a price target of $815. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on META stock with a price target of $753.Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending.\"We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment,\" Walmsley said.The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026.Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses.See Meta Platforms Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders exchanged tense rhetoric over the Arctic territory, with Trump threatening tariffs on eight European countries and demanding control of Greenland, which is part of Denmark.European leaders responded by calling the threats \"completely wrong\" and \"unacceptable.\"Over in Asia, China will release its fourth-quarter GDP numbers, along with December figures for retail sales, urban investment and industrial output.

    "body": "Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,\" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. \"Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,\" Buffett says. \"There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five.\" How to get on the listSo what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? \"It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,\" Buffett says. \"You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.\"But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. \"You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,\" he says. \"I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.\"Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. \"Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,\" he says. \"It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.\"Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of \"selling himself\" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.\"That's not crazy,\" Buffett says. \"Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Timon Schneider | SOPA Images | APCompany: Integer Holdings Corp (ITGR)Business: Integer Holdings Corporation is a medical device contract development and manufacturing company. Its brands include Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical. The company's Cardio & Vascular product line offers a range of components, subassemblies, and finished devices used in interventional cardiology, structural heart, heart failure, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, interventional oncology, electrophysiology, vascular access, infusion therapy, hemodialysis, urology and gastroenterology procedures. Its interventional cardiology portfolio is focused primarily on the design, development and manufacture of catheter and wire-based technologies intended to diagnose and treat cardiac disease. Its electrophysiology products include devices used by electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists for the treatment of cardiac arrythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.Stock Market Value: $3.01B ($85.78 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconInteger Holdings in the past 12 monthsActivist: Irenic Capital ManagementOwnership: greater than 3%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Irenic Capital was founded in October 2021 by Adam Katz, a former portfolio manager at Elliott Investment Management, and Andy Dodge, a former investment partner at Indaba Capital Management. Irenic invests in public companies and works collaboratively with firm leadership. The firm's activism has thus far primarily focused on strategic activism, recommending spinoffs and sales of businesses.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic took a position of more than 3% in Integer Holdings and is calling for a board refreshment and the exploration of a potential sale of the company.Behind the scenesInteger Holdings is a medical device contract development and manufacturing organization (\"CDMO\"). The company acts as an outsourced design and development partner for original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. When developing new medical devices, OEMs typically outsource certain components to third parties, who then become responsible for those parts for the entire lifecycle of the product. Integer is the largest of such companies and the only publicly traded pure-play medical device CDMO. From an end market perspective, the company specializes in cardiovascular and neuromodulation applications, which are generally considered to be very high quality because of their interventional, and therefore highly sticky nature. Moreover, the stringent regulatory and FDA approval requirements for these markets create very high barriers to change. However, despite this strong market position and competitive moat, the company's share price has struggled, down nearly 40% in the past year.The catalyst for this downturn was Integer's most recent quarterly report, which disclosed that the market demand for three specific products fell short of the OEM's expectations, causing the OEMs to significantly reduce their orders from Integer. As a result, Integer is now facing an air pocket in growth from 2026. While the company typically targets 6% to 8% organic growth, 2026 is now projected to be between -2% and 2%. Despite management's assurances that this is just an air pocket and that growth will normalize in 2027, the stock plummeted in extended trading and in the days that followed. A development like this followed by the assurances of management generally does not result in a 40% decline in a stock. The nature of Integer's business brings along certain confidentiality constraints around critical information. So, while management can give assurances, they cannot give transparency into its pipeline or the identity of its customers, programs and platforms.On Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic Capital had a position of more than 3% in Integer and is calling for a board refreshment and to explore a potential sale of the company. There are a few reasons why a sale makes sense here. First, as the only public pure-play medical device CDMO, Integer has no public comps and suffers from limited investor and analyst understanding and coverage. Second, as discussed above when a company is required to have opacity around its sales and customers, it is much easier operated and grown in a private setting. Third, public investors have limited information with which to analyze the company, where a private buyer subject to a confidentiality agreement would be able to perform diligence on Integer's products, contracts and pipeline in full detail, allowing them to underwrite future growth with greater confidence. This is not lost on Integer management. In 2024, they explored strategic alternatives and reportedly received bids at a premium to the share price at the time (estimated in the $110 to $115 per share range). While the company ultimately didn't pursue a transaction, as the stock subsequently rerated, the recent share price pullback suggests that private equity interest should remain at a meaningful premium to today's valuation. For example, Teleflex Medical recently announced the sale of its OEM business at approximately 4.7-times revenue and 16- to 17-times EBITDA. Integer's largest competitors, Resonetics and Confluent Medical, are both PE owned and were acquired at valuations exceeding 20-times EBITDA. Extrapolating these multiples to Integer, which currently trades at roughly 2-times revenue and 12-times EBITDA, would equate to an acquisition price north of $120 per share.In evaluating this decision, Irenic would like to see a board refreshment that would include directors with medical OEM experience and financial acumen. This would add needed experience in two areas integral in making a transformative decision like whether to sell or not. Even without a potential sale of the company, this is a board that needs refreshment. Of the 11 directors, five will have been on the board for at least 10 years by the next annual meeting. This includes the chair, Pamela Bailey, who has been on the board for nearly 25 years. Introducing some fresh perspectives could materially improve the board's ability to assess the potential options to maximize value for shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis.Irenic has significant experience in strategic activism, identifying companies that are struggling in the public markets and helping implement spinoffs and sales of businesses, often to private equity. Integer fits the firm's playbook perfectly. While we typically prefer an activist to weigh a standalone thesis against a sale path, it is hard to recall a company with less justification for remaining in the public market. With the nomination deadline opening Jan.21, Irenic's next steps – and whether the firm chooses to nominate directors – should emerge soon. However, while Irenic is more than capable of running a proxy contest, it has historically received board representation via settlements, and we would expect the firm to be looking for the same result here. Moreover, given Irenic's strategically driven approach to its engagements, we would expect the firm to de-emphasize its governance concerns should the current board initiate a formal strategic review and receive credible and value accretive offers.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale, attends an AI summit in Paris in February 2025.Getty ImagesThe founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to \"move fast and break things,\" and \"continuously iterate and test and improve.\"Berge said: \"It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company.\" Corporate experience 'matters less'Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. \"I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,\" he said. Fridjtoff added that it \"matters less\" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. \"You might not think with a blank-slate state,\" he said. \"I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,\" he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.\"He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,\" Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. \"I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,\" He added.

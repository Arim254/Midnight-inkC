    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

    "body": "Oil prices rose more than 1.5% in Asian trade on Thursday, on increasing concerns of a U.S military attack on Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.Anton Petrus | Moment | Getty ImagesOil prices slid Monday as investors dialed back fears of a supply shock after U.S. President Donald Trump's statements on Iran signaled a possible easing in tensions between Tehran and Washington.Trump has repeatedly warned Iran of a possible intervention if it failed to reach a nuclear deal or continued cracking down on domestic protests, which Tehran claims are fueled by the West. On Saturday, he told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with the U.S.His comments came after Iran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that preparations for negotiations were under way.Oil prices rose to a six-month high recently amid fears the United States could carry out a military strike against Iran. Washington last week deployed a \"massive Armada\" toward Iran, a move that raised fears of a confrontation with the Middle Eastern country.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past yearGlobal benchmark Brent fell 4.96% to $65.88 a barrel as of 3.22 a.m. ET. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were about 5% lower at $61.76 per barrel.Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the renewed slide in prices follows reports that Washington and Tehran have been communicating through intermediaries, raising hopes that tensions could ease rather than spiral.\"The talks are happening at the same time Iran is threatening a regional war should they be attacked, which could lead to substantially higher oil prices, an outcome that the Trump Administration would like to avoid,\" he told CNBC.Marko Papic, BCA Research macro and geopolitical strategist, added that the U.S. administration's sensitivity to oil prices could act as a brake on further escalation. \"I do think that President Trump is concerned that if oil prices go up to, you know, $70-$80, he's going to get even further into a hole ahead of the midterms.\"The U.S. faces midterm elections later this year, and fuel prices have traditionally been a sensitive political issue for voters.Diplomatic feelers also come at a time when additional supply is quietly entering the market. Venezuelan crude, much of it drawn from offshore and onshore inventories rather than new production, is adding to available barrels, even as global oil production continues to exceed demand.Both experts said those flows are helping cap prices even as OPEC+ continues to manage output carefully.\"While additional quantities of Venezuelan oil are coming to market as offshore and on shore inventories are liquidated and sold, the oil market will also continue to be supported by OPEC+ decision to hold steady its current production levels,\" said Lipow.The oil cartel on Sunday decided to leave production levels unchanged for March, extending a three-month supply freeze.

    "body": "A jeweller shows gold and silver bars at his shop in downtown Kuwait City on Jan. 12, 2026. Yasser Al-zayyat | Afp | Getty ImagesGold and silver extended their sell-off Monday, deepening losses from last Friday's rout as a firmer dollar and profit-taking drains momentum from a rally that had propelled the precious metals to record highs just days earlier.Spot gold lost around 5% to $4,616.79 per ounce, having crashed nearly 10% on Friday, when prices plunged below $5,000 an ounce. Silver, which had surged alongside gold on safe haven demand and speculative inflows, also remained under pressure after last Friday's 30% nosedive that saw the metal log its worst day since March 1980.Spot prices of the white metal were down more than 12%, before paring losses slightly to $78.30 per ounce as of 3.19 a.m. ET.The CME Group increased margin requirements following the steep sell-off last week, effective Monday after market close. Margins on COMEX gold futures have been raised to 8% from 6%, while those on the COMEX 5,000-ounce silver futures were lifted to 15% from 11%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold and silver extend sell-off after historic plungeAccording to analysts, the pullback follows from the violent reversal on Friday, when optimism around U.S. interest-rate cuts collided with a sudden reassessment of Federal Reserve leadership after President Donald Trump nominated former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Chair Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.\"The 'Buy America' trade is back as a result, and the independence bid that drove gold and silver to nosebleed record heights right below $5,600 and $122 per ounce early Thursday morning is unraveling,\" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note on Monday.Christopher Forbes, head of Asia and the Middle East at CMC Markets, said gold's sharp retreat reflects a classic correction after an extraordinary rally rather than a breakdown in the longer-term bullish thesis.Gold's retreat is a \"classic air-pocket after an extraordinary run,\" Forbes said. \"Profit-taking, a firmer dollar, and fresh geopolitical headlines from Washington have knocked froth off a crowded trade.\"The dollar index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of currencies, has strengthened about 0.8% since Thursday.A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced gold less attractive for foreign buyers, while higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-paying yellow metal by making Treasurys more attractive as a safe haven.   Warsh has been an advocate of a tighter monetary policy, and his announcement as Fed chair has strengthened the dollar. At the same time, Trump's statements indicating a possible deal with Iran appear to have eased geopolitical concerns — WTI crude futures were down about 4% on Monday.In the near term, gold prices will remain elevated but volatile as markets await further clarity on Warsh's policy direction, Forbes said.Silver prices are still up around 16% since the start of the year, while gold prices are also about 8% higher year to date. Gold and silver both saw record-smashing rallies last year, surging about 65% and 145%, respectively.\"Renewed dollar weakness or confirmation of a dovish Warsh would bring dip-buyers back,\" said Forbes, who still maintains a bullish case for bullion in the longer 12 month horizon, adding that the metal can revisit recent highs, if the Fed continues easing while growth and inflation stay uneven.",

    "body": "Amber Casino and former scam center, owned by Chen Zhi, a Chinese businessman who was deported to China, is seen in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on Jan. 18, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesChinese-language money laundering networks funneled an estimated $16.1 billion in illicit funds through cryptocurrency transactions in 2025, according to a report released Tuesday by blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis.These networks, known as CMLNs, accounted for roughly one-fifth of the illicit cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2025, which Chainalysis valued at over $82 billion.The criminal networks primarily operate through various channels and chat groups on the messaging platform Telegram, where launderers advertise their services to prospective customers. These postings often include pictures showing heaps of cash and public testimonials as proof of liquidity and service quality, according to the report.These Telegram-based channels, known as \"guarantee\" platforms, function as marketing hubs or informal escrow services that connect vendors with prospective clients. While the platforms do not control the underlying transactions, Chainalysis said they are the main conduits through which illicit deals are arranged.Beyond money laundering, activity on these platforms includes other forms of criminal trade, such as human trafficking and the sale of Starlink dishes used in Southeast Asian scam centers, according to Andrew Fierman, Head of National Security Intelligence at Chainalysis.These are very large, well resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat.Mark ButtonCriminology professor at the University of PortsmouthProspective clients also range from organized crime syndicates to sanctioned state actors, Fierman said.\"We have seen everything from North Korean money and DPRK-related hacks going through, to a whole host of other illicit activity,\" Fierman told CNBC.Such Telegram-based platforms are common mediums for illicit networks worldwide, according to Mark Button, a criminology professor at the University of Portsmouth, who has studied similar networks in India and West Africa.The report identified six main techniques used by Chinese-language money laundering networks to launder funds, often relying on digital assets such as cryptocurrencies to move funds discreetly.According to Fierman, cryptocurrencies appeal to criminal actors because of their liquidity, ease and relative anonymity, particularly for those seeking to avoid having their funds frozen on traditional financial platforms.Stablecoins such as USDT, issued by Tether, and Circle's USDC, are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, often a fiat currency like the U.S. Dollar. Their lower volatility compared with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum helps keep transaction costs down.\"If you are involved in illicit activity, the last thing you want to be doing is losing more money,\" Fierman said. \"You already have to pay money for the laundering process... the last thing you want is for there to be a really bad week on Bitcoin and lose another 10% of your money.\"Casinos, crypto and crimeMany organized crime groups that use crypto-based laundering services often also move funds through legitimate-looking enterprises, Button said.\"Casinos are a classic means to launder any criminal proceeds,\" he said, adding that it is common practice for criminal groups to launder illicit funds through inflated revenue figures.Since at least 2022, Southeast Asia has begun emerging as a hub for licensed and unlicensed casinos with links to organized crime, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.While the Chainalysis study examined organized networks that use Mandarin as their primary communication medium, many transactions also originate from outside China, Fierman noted. These include places such as Cambodia and Myanmar, where organized crime syndicates have been found to run elaborate scam centers.\"China has actually been very good at cracking down on these kinds of scams, because they generally don't like organized crime,\" Button said.On Thursday, China's state media Xinhua reported that 11 members of a Myanmar-based scam syndicate were executed on charges of \"intentional homicide, intentional injury, unlawful detention, fraud and casino establishment\".China has strict laws on money laundering and has banned cryptocurrency trading since 2021, citing its use in organized crime.As a result, Chinese criminal groups often relocate to jurisdictions in Southeast Asia like Cambodia and Myanmar, where weaker legislation and corrupted local officials allow them to operate more freely, according to Button.While authorities have proactively sought to clamp down on these transnational crime syndicates, enforcement has been challenging due to the sophistication of their operations and the complexity of cross-border enforcement.\"These are very large, well-resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat,\" Button said.Chainalysis estimated that these Chinese-language money laundering networks laundered the equivalent of $44 million per day in 2025.Despite efforts to clamp down on such illicit trade, Fierman said many of these networks are likely to continue evading capture. \"This is how illicit actors operate. They evolve, and once one gets detected, they hop to another avenue\".",

    "body": "An employee works on a carbon fiber production line at Zhongfu Shenying in Lianyungang, China's eastern Jiangsu province on July 31, 2025.   Str | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity gathered speed in January, according to a private survey released Monday, as manufacturers accelerated production and front-loaded shipments ahead of the extended Lunar New Year holiday. The seasonally-adjusted RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, rose to 50.3 in January from 50.1 the previous month, in line with analysts' expectations of 50.3 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates an expansion, while one below that suggests contraction. That marked the strongest level since October, when the private survey came in at 50.6.   Production accelerated last month as new orders picked up both at home and abroad, prompting firms to hire additional staff to cope with rising workloads and clear outstanding orders.    Total new orders expanded for the eighth straight month while new export orders rebounded, primarily buoyed by increased demand from overseas buyers, particularly Southeast Asia.    Business confidence, however, slipped to a nine-month low, as firms worried about rising costs, the private survey showed. Corporate expenses expanded at the fastest rate in four months, pushing factory-gate prices up for the first time since November 2024.  Metal prices, in particular, surged during the latest survey period, sending input cost inflation to its highest level since last September, the survey showed.  \"Looking ahead, if cost pressures persist while demand recovery is limited, profit margins will remain under pressure,\" said Yao Yu, founder of credit research firm RatingDog.  Subdued confidence among Chinese manufacturers could further hurt demand in the upcoming months, said Jingyi Pan, an associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, noting that the rise in geopolitical instability at the start of this year may have prompted firms to front-load their production. The reading was better than an official survey released on Saturday, which showed manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in January, coming in at 49.3, compared with 50.1 in the previous month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The RatingDog private survey, which samples a smaller group of export-oriented manufacturers, has typically painted a brighter picture than the official polls that cover a broader range of firms. National Bureau of Statistics officials attributed the slump to a seasonal slowdown and softer global demand. Local media reported that some factories halted production last month to allow their workers to return home ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year.  This year's Lunar New Year holiday has been extended to nine days for the first time, stretching from Feb. 15 to Feb. 23, as Beijing aims to boost domestic spending on travel, tourism, dine-out services and leisure activities during the holiday.   Tepid growthThe two PMI readings also provided an early glimpse of how the world's second-largest economy fared at the start of this year. China's economy hit the government's 5% growth target last year, underpinned by strong exports as manufacturers ramped up shipments to non-U.S. markets amid higher U.S. tariffs. watch nowEconomists, however, have warned of persistent deflationary pressures, with retail sales weakening to the slowest pace in three years. Fixed-asset investment also recorded its first annual decline in decades, contracting 3.8% last year, as a deepening property slump and local governments' fiscal constraints curbed investment.    Growth momentum in the economy is expected to remain weak in January, Jing Wang, China economist at Nomura, said in a note, citing payback effects from Beijing's consumer goods trade-in program last year and the persistent property distress. Chinese officials launched a package of measures last month aimed at lowering financing costs for households and corporates and boosting credit borrowing demand.But \"these measures are far from enough to stabilize growth,\" said Wang, adding that Beijing will have to \"do much more in coming months to deliver an annual GDP growth rate above 4.5% in 2026.\" The Chinese government is expected to announce its official growth target for 2026 at the annual parliamentary session in March. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

Jeenah Moon | ReutersAmazon's \"Melania\" earned $7 million at the domestic box office during its debut this weekend, the highest opening for a non-music documentary in more than a decade.Documentaries are not typically major ticket sales drivers, with the majority of releases over the last 10 years opening under $5 million and grossing $10 million to $20 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Documentaries and concert films by popular musical artists often outperform these numbers because of their built-in fan bases.Notably, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" retains the record for the highest-opening political documentary with $23.9 million. The film, which opened in 2004, also holds the record for the highest domestic haul for a political documentary with $119 million.\"We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for 'Melania' exceeding our expectations,\" said Kevin Wilson, head of domestic theatrical distribution at Amazon MGM Studios. \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"The Melania Trump documentary was acquired by the tech giant, which operates the streaming service Prime Video, for an estimated $40 million, and reports suggest the company spent nearly the same price tag on marketing for the film.Ticket sales were driven by women and moviegoers over 55, with both demographics accounting for 70% or more of receipts. Additionally, rural theaters represented 46% of total box office grosses, according to EntTelligence data. Typically, these theaters, which operate in areas with populations of fewer than 500,000 people, account for around 30% of movie ticket sales.EntTelligence estimates that 600,000 moviegoers saw the film over the weekend.While review sites have been flooded with strong audience reviews — Rotten Tomatoes' \"Popcornmeter\" stands at 99% from more than 500 users — critical responses were more scathing. \"Melania\" holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 19 reviews, with many critics calling the documentary \"propaganda.\"Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes and CNBC.",

Trump | Via Truth SocialA government official and top royal from the United Arab Emirates purchased a $500 million stake in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture last year, months before the Trump administration greenlit the sale of advanced AI chips to the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — is the Gulf nation's national security adviser and manager of its largest wealth fund. Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company, took a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, according to the Journal. The deal would make Aryam the largest shareholder of World Liberty, and the company's only known investor besides the founders, the Journal reported.World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.The company counts President Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The deal, according to the Journal, was signed by Eric Trump in the days before his father's second inauguration as president. It came as Tahnoon was seeking access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S., which the Biden administration had blocked over concerns that the chips would end up in China. According to the Journal, the agreement saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities and $31 million to Witkoff family entities.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

The agreement called for a fifth of the chips to go to Tahnoon's own AI company, G42.The Journal report has prompted new scrutiny of the Trump administration's dealings with the UAE and Tahnoon, with some in Congress warning of potential conflicts of interest or corruption. \"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"The Trump Administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.\"Warren called on Witkoff, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"testify in front of Congress on mounting evidence that they sold out American national security in order to benefit the President's crypto company — and about whether any officials lined their own pockets in the process.\"White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the Journal that \"[t]here are no conflicts of interest.\" She added that Witkoff is working to \"advance President Trump's goals of peace around the world.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also defended the president on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\"I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn't do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office,\" Blanche said, without providing evidence. Republicans and Trump have long accused the Biden family of corruption over the former President Joe Biden's family's business dealings abroad. Though an impeachment inquiry was launched in the House over the matter, evidence of wrongdoing by Biden never materialized. \"I don't have a comment on it beyond President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons,\" Blanche said. \"This idea that there's something untoward or unprecedented is just a repeated story that isn't true.\"Read the complete Wall Street Journal story here.",

    "body": "A local resident watches on as the remaining area of the Harcourt fire burns in the background on January 12, 2026 near Harcourt, Australia.Jesse Thompson | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe catastrophe bond market shattered a host of records in 2025 — and many expect another banner year as investors flock to what has been an often-overlooked asset class.The issuance of so-called CAT bonds ballooned to $25.6 billion in 2025, according to specialist data provider Artemis.bm, eclipsing the 2024 record of just under $17.7 billion by a whopping 45%.The issuance stemmed from 122 transactions, surpassing the previous record of 95 set in 2023, with 15 first-time sponsors seen entering the market. Taken together, these records reflect a breakout year for what has long been considered a relatively niche corner of the insurance industry.Andy Palmer, head of insurance-linked securities (ILS) structuring for EMEA and APAC at Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers, said no one could have predicted the amount of CAT bond issuance in 2025, describing the feat as \"absolutely remarkable.\" \"By any dimension you want to measure it, the market is growing. We are seeing larger deals being done, we are seeing new sponsors coming to market [and] we are seeing a meaningful expansion of risk,\" Palmer told CNBC by video call.\"It was just a shift, I think, mentally for everybody that looks at this space,\" Palmer said. \"We expect that now to continue from here on in.\"watch nowFirst created in the 1990s, CAT bonds refer to a type of financial instrument designed to raise money for insurers in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake. These insurance-linked securities are essentially a way for insurers or reinsurers to offload the risk of potentially large losses from extreme events to investors. This in turn, provides insurers with access to funding, helping them to pay claims in the event of a catastrophe. We expect cat bond deal flow to be brisk over the coming months.Steve Evansowner and editor-in-chief at Artemis.bmSwiss Re's Palmer said roughly 60% of CAT bond market deals tend to be for a three-year term and investors were highly likely to want to renew coverage when those deals expire in 2026.\"So, a very quick rule of thumb might be to have a look at the new issuance back in 2023, which we measure at about $15.6 billion, and that would provide a sort of floor,\" Palmer said. An expectation of further growth and larger deals in 2026 means CAT bond issuance could climb to around $20 billion, Palmer said. If realized, this wouldn't be quite as much as 2025, but it would still represent the second-largest year of issuance on record.Modern portfolio theoryIn the absence of a disastrous event triggering a loss, CAT bonds are known to offer highly attractive equity-like returns, low volatility and low correlation to broader financial markets. The emergence of this asset class as an increasingly mainstream financial instrument comes at a time when the climate crisis is leading to an increase in both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.In just the last few weeks, for example, a sprawling winter storm has left hundreds of thousands without power in the U.S., severe flooding has wrought havoc across large parts of Mozambique, Eswatini, South Africa and Zimbabwe, and a major heatwave has gripped southeast Australia. This aerial view shows residents wading through floodwater to cross a road near Maputo on January 20, 2026.Emidio Jozine | Afp | Getty ImagesSteve Evans, owner and editor-in-chief at Artemis.bm, told CNBC that investor interest in the asset class remains \"very high\" after what was the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for many CAT bond fund strategies in 2025.\"This, alongside the increasing uptake of cat bonds as an efficient multi-year source of reinsurance among insurance carriers and others seeking catastrophe risk transfer, should ensure 2026 sees another strong year of issuance in the sector,\" Evans said.\"Over the coming year the market will also see significant levels of maturing deals that will drive cash levels higher and need to be recycled into the new issuance, or be returned to investors,\" he continued. \"This, along with rising investor awareness of the benefits of cat bonds and ILS as a diversifying asset class, should further ensure that deal execution remains attractive for buyers of cat bond protection, so at Artemis we expect cat bond deal flow to be brisk over the coming months.\" Indeed, while only $683 million of CAT bond issuance has been tracked so far this year, Evans said there is already more than $2 billion in the pipeline and due to be settled in the coming weeks.Read moreBob Smith, president and co-chief investment officer at Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, described CAT bonds and insurance-linked securities as a standout choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolios over the coming months.\"As a diversifier? Oh my goodness, this is the one thing on that whole spreadsheet that you are looking for,\" Smith told CNBC by video call.\"This is the essence of MPT,\" Smith said, referring to the acronym for modern portfolio theory, an investment strategy designed to balance the risk and return of assets.\"Modern portfolio theory says you really need to diversify your portfolio. Well, this is quintessentially the best thing out there at the moment that you could achieve that,\" Smith said.  Rising capital pressure Not everyone was as bullish on the outlook for CAT bonds. Analysts at Fitch Ratings said they expect continued growth in the alternative reinsurance capital market in 2026, citing robust supply from investors, but warned of rising capital pressure.\"Continued momentum in demand will also contribute, including from new sponsors entering the space and the expansion of non-peak perils, including wildfire, cyber and casualty risks,\" analysts at Fitch Ratings said in a research note published Jan. 15. \"Catastrophe bonds achieved double-digit returns in 2025, with manageable losses from the California wildfires and the generally higher positioning of catastrophe bonds in cedent catastrophe reinsurance towers.\" A man carries a shovel as he crosses a street in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood in New York on January 25, 2026.Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesLike Swiss Re's Palmer, analysts at Fitch Ratings said they anticipate CAT bond investors to reinvest their bumper returns back into the ILS market this year, which in turn will boost capital and pressure returns. \"However, Fitch expects investor returns in 2026 to remain attractive relative to other asset classes,\" they added.",

    "body": "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during the annual \"March for Life\" in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 23, 2026. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said he believes he has the votes to end the partial government shutdown by Tuesday, with the House set to take up a Senate-approved spending package this week. \"Let's say I'm confident that we'll do it at least by Tuesday,\" the Louisiana Republican said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday morning after Congress failed to approve a spending package and send it to President Donald Trump by the Jan. 30 deadline. Senate Democrats demanded changes to the package that the House originally passed after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Democrats ultimately had the Department of Homeland Security funding stripped from the package and replaced with two-week stopgap funding for the agency. Now, the amended package has to be reapproved by the House.The House is set to begin taking up the bill on Monday. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first step in that process.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

House Democrats are demanding assurances that changes to DHS's immigration operations will be finalized before voting on the spending package. \"Well, we're going to have that conversation later on today and as we return to Washington. But the one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on ABC's \"This Week\" when asked how he and Democrats will vote. \"The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today,\" he said.Sources familiar with the matter told MS NOW over the weekend that Jeffries spoke with Johnson and said Democrats will not provide the votes to fast-track the spending package, potentially jeopardizing the end of the shutdown this week.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he will vote against the package when it comes to the floor. \"I'm not just a no, I'm a firm no, and I'm going to advocate with colleagues that they vote no,\" Khanna said. \"I just in good conscience cannot vote to give more money to ICE agents as they're violating our constitutional rights.\"Democratic resistance to the package makes Johnson's job of pushing the package through significantly harder. He has a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House, set to dwindle further after Democrat Christian Menefee won a special election in Texas. \"I have a one-vote margin, yes, for the rest of 2026,\" Johnson said. \"But we're going to demonstrate once again that this is the party that takes governing seriously.\"In addition to the stopgap for DHS, the package includes bills to fully fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year.This story is developing.

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

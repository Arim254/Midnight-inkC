    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

Micron Technology and dutch chip equipment maker ASML jumped 10% and 9%, respectively, to start the new trading year. Lam Research and Intel rallied more than 6% each, while Marvell Technology rose 5%.Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia gained about 4% and 1%, respectively. In 2025, AMD gained 77% while Nvidia added 39%.Chipmaking stocks got a boost in 2025 from the ongoing AI buildout.

Last year marked a third consecutive year of gains for the sector, despite growing AI valuation concerns and worries over the sustainability of the trade.Investors have raised concerns over the prospect of an AI bubble in recent months as the sector continues its massive ascent. In November, Michael Burry of \"Big Short\" fame revealed a short position in Nvidia and AI winner Palantir. He later blasted hyperscalers for artificially boosting earnings. The rally in chipmaking stocks lifted the VanEck Semiconductor ETF about 4% to build on a nearly 49% rally in 2025.

    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "A pedestrian passes in front of the Saks Fifth Avenue at Brookfield Place in New York.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSaks Global named a new CEO on Friday as the retailer is reportedly on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection.The parent of high-end department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which is privately held, will now be led by Richard Baker, the company's executive chairman, Saks said in a news release. He will continue to hold the executive chairman role.With the shake-up, three-decade long Saks executive Marc Metrick will leave the company. The news release said Metrick's is departing \"to pursue new opportunities.\"In a statement, Baker said he will work \"to secure a strong and stable future for our company.\"\"Across Saks Global, with our deep industry expertise, well-established relationships within the luxury sector, and talented employees, we will strengthen our position so that we can capitalize on the many opportunities we see for our company in the luxury market,\" he said.Saks is preparing to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its 2024 acquisition of department store chain Neiman Marcus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.It's the latest twist in the luxury department store operator's effort to regain its financial footing. Saks Global was created in 2024 after Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Co. acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion. By marrying the two luxury chains, it sought to better compete with other retailers and department stores including Nordstrom and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's.The deal turned Saks Global into a larger player, which included Saks Fifth Avenue, its off-price chain Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus' namesake department store chain and Bergdorf Goodman. Yet the company has taken clear steps to raise cash and shore up its finances, including the recent sale of Neiman Marcus' Beverly Hills flagship and Saks Global's debt restructuring in August 2025.In his biography on Saks Global's website, the company credited Baker for leading the acquisition of Neiman Marcus and described his strong real estate background. Baker is an owner of National Realty & Development Corp., one of the largest real estate development companies in the United States, and he previously served as the chairman of the board of directors for Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., which he also converted into a real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq.

American authorities said Saturday morning that the couple had been indicted in New York on drug-trafficking charges.The U.S. military operation was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, U.S. President Donald Trump said in an early morning post on Truth Social. \"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country.

Prior to the start of the press conference, the president apparently posted a video of the operation on Truth Social.  U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.The Maduros have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she wrote.CBS News reported that the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force unit was involved in the capture of Maduro.In an interview with \"Fox and Friends Weekend\" on Saturday, Trump said the U.S. suffered a few injuries but no deaths in the operation, and that U.S. forces waited four days to launch the attack due to weather conditions.Trump also said Maduro and his wife were flown to the USS Iwo Jima following their capture and will head to New York to face the narco-terrorism charges. Photo posted on President Donald Trump's Truth Social appears to show Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.

The White House, which reposted Trump's Truth Social statement on its X account, didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who had earlier questioned whether the U.S. attack was constitutional, said in a X post on Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the U.S. operation \"was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.\"\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee added.Rubio, meanwhile, responded to the operation on social media by reposting a statement he made in July 2025, stating: \"Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.\"U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said in a post on X that Maduro would \"finally face justice for his crimes.\"watch nowThere was no immediate confirmation from the Venezuelan government. Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's vice president, demanded that the U.S. provide proof that Maduro and his wife are alive, in an interview on state television station Venezolana de Televisión.Maduro's official Facebook page posted a video stating that attacks occurred in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language statement.The statement in the video added that the U.S. would fail in its goal of possessing Venezuela's oil and minerals, and that Maduro had declared a national emergency and mobilized defense forces.The official spokesperson for Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who leads the  Venezuelan opposition, said in a post on X that it had no comment on the operation.Trump told The New York Times that the operation was a result of \"a lot of good planning.\" \"It was a brilliant operation, actually,\" Trump told the Times.Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, at about 2 a.m. local time (0600 GMT), according to images circulating on social media that could not be independently verified.Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA's oil production and refining were normal, and its key facilities had suffered no damage, according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations told Reuters.The port of La Guaira near Caracas, one of the country's largest but is not used for oil operations, was reported to have suffered severe damage, Reuters reported.Smoke rises from Port of La Guaira after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard on January 03, 2026 in Caracas, Venezuela. Jesus Vargas | Getty ImagesTrump has repeatedly threatened action against Maduro. On Dec. 23, 2025, he said it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power.Trump last month announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, saying the country was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"The strategy to pressure Maduro comes as the U.S. and Venezuela's opposition say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. Trump has also accused Maduro of running a \"narco-state.\"Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in a post on X that Caracas was under attack and urged an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has said Washington is seeking control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs. We're going to grow.\"Read more CNBC auto newsGM's record stock performance beats Tesla, Ford and other automakers in 2025EV realism is here.

Delta Air Lines said it was resuming Caribbean service and working to rebook affected customers as schedules normalize.Frontier Airlines also confirmed with CNBC that it has resumed normal operations.Other airlines impacted by the temporary restrictions included American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.Carriers waived change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the closures if they rebooked flights later in the month. More than a dozen airports in the region were included in the waivers.The brief shutdown underscored how quickly military action can disrupt civilian air travel, forcing airlines to suspend operations well beyond the immediate conflict zone.Major U.S. airlines have not served Venezuela directly for years. American Airlines was the last major carrier to halt flights to the country in 2019 amid unrest.",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI saw user backlash after its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok generated sexualized pictures of children in response to user prompts.A Grok reply to one user on X on Friday stated that it was \"urgently fixing\" the issue and called child sexual abuse material \"illegal and prohibited.\" In replies to users, the bot also posted that a company could face criminal or civil penalties if it knowingly facilitates or fails to prevent this type of content after being alerted.Grok posts are AI-generated messages and do not stand in for official company statements.Musk's xAI, which created Grok and merged with X last year, sent an autoreply to a request for comment: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"Users on X raised concerns in recent days over explicit content of minors, including children wearing minimal clothing, being generated using the Grok tool.  The social media site added an \"Edit Image\" button to photos that allows any user to alter it using text prompts and without the original poster's consent.Read more CNBC tech newsChina's BYD overtakes Tesla as world's top EV seller for the first timeChips, robots and fortune telling collide in China's 'Silicon Valley' AI boomDust to data centers: The year AI tech giants, and billions in debt, began remaking the American landscapeGoogle wraps up best year on Wall Street since 2009, beating megacap peers as AI story strengthensA post from xAI technical staff member Parsa Tajik also acknowledged the issue.\"Hey! Thanks for flagging. The team is looking into further tightening our gaurdrails,\" Tajik wrote in a post.On Friday, government officials in India and France released statements promising to look into the matter. The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment while the Federal Communications Commission did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The proliferation of AI image-generating platforms since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 has raised concerns over content manipulation and online safety across the board. It's also contributed to an increasing number of platforms that have produced deepfake nudes of actual people.David Thiel, a trust and safety researcher who was part of the now-disbanded Stanford Internet Observatory, told CNBC that different US laws generally prohibit the creation and distribution of certain explicit images, including those depicting child sexual abuse, or non-consensual intimate images. Legal determinations about AI-generated images, like those produced by Grok, can hinge on specific details of the content created and shared, he said.In a paper he co-authored called \"Generative ML and CSAM: Implications and Mitigations,\" Stanford researchers noted that \"the appearance of a child being abused has been sufficient for prosecution,\" in precedent-setting cases in the US.While other chatbots have faced similar issues, xAI has repeatedly landed in hot water for misuse or apparent flaws in Grok's design or underlying technology. \"There are a number of things companies could do to prevent their AI tools being used in this manner,\" Thiel said, \"The most important in this case would be to remove the ability to alter user-uploaded images. Allowing users to alter uploaded imagery is a recipe for NCII. Nudification has historically been the primary use case of such mechanisms.\"NCII refers to non-consensual intimate images.In May, X faced a backlash after Grok generated unsolicited comments about \"white genocide\" in South Africa. Two months later, Grok posted antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. Despite the stumbles, xAI has continued to land partnerships and deals.The Department of Defense added Grok to its AI agents platform last month, and the tool is the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi. watch now",

After months of pressure on Maduro, Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. had assisted in a \"large scale strike\" against the country and its leader, who was captured along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and is being brought to the U.S. \"Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,\" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a post to X on Saturday.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationThe Constitution grants Congress primary authority to declare war. The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 in response to the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to take military action unilaterally and requires the president to consult with Congress when troops are deployed.But lawmakers said the president did not seek approval and did not brief Congress on his plans.Trump is expected to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, MS NOW reported, citing two sources. Trump will reportedly make an appearance at the gathering and it is unclear how long he will stay, MS Now reported.The lawmakers had already been scheduled to meet at the center for a policy forum to discuss the agenda for the second half of the 119th Congress, according to an invitation obtained by MS NOW. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement, called the decision to take military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization \"reckless.\"\"The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela. Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,\" Schumer said.Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told MSNOW that he had \"no briefing or heads up. I received all information from the news media at this point.\" And Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those who cheered the capture of Maduro, but said Congress had not been given any forewarning.\"And that's probably one reason why it didn't leak over these four days,\" Cotton said, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" on Saturday. \"Congress isn't notified when the FBI is going to arrest a drug trafficker or cyber criminal here in the United States. Nor should Congress be notified when the executive branch is executing arrests on indicted persons.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.Trump seemed to shrug off concerns about the constitutionality of the attack during a call-in to \"Fox & Friends.\"\"The Democrats, maybe they'll take a shot... all they do is complain,\" Trump said. \"They should say, 'great job.' They shouldn't say, 'Oh gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years.\" The president also said that the attack originally had been planned for earlier in the week but was rescheduled due to weather. No U.S. soldiers were killed in the operation, he said.During a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said members of Congress were called immediately after the mission, which he said was \"largely a law enforcement function.\" Notifying members ahead of the action could have jeopardized the mission, he said.\"This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission... it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, 'Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,\" Rubio said. \"Congress has a tendency to leak. This would not be good. If they leaked... I think it would have been maybe a very different result,\" Trump said at the press conference. \"Congress will leak, and we don't want leakers,\" he continued.The Trump administration has ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government in recent months, alleging that Maduro is the head of a narco-terror organization. He recently ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that he had spoken \"in the last several hours\" with Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and that the White House was working to schedule briefings with members when Congress is back in session next week.\"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,\" Johnson said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the operation an \"important first step to bring [Maduro] to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" Neither Thune nor Johnson, through their offices, responded to requests for comment on whether Republican leaders had been briefed ahead of the attack.\"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune said.As news of the attack on Venezuela broke early Saturday, there was at least some Republican skepticism.\"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted to X.Hours later, and after a phone call with Rubio, Lee had changed his tune.\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee said in a subsequent post.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., the former Trump ally who had a falling-out with the president and is resigning from Congress on Jan. 5, was part of a small group within the GOP who questioned the attack. \"(W)hy is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I'm not endorsing Russia or China),\" Greene posted to X on Saturday.And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent foil to Trump, questioned the constitutionality of Trump's removal of Maduro.\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie posted to X.Democrats, meanwhile, called for more answers and questioned what might come next for Venezuela, where Maduro has ruled for more than a decade.\"Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.\"Secretary Rubio repeatedly denied to Congress that the Administration intended to force regime change in Venezuela. The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region,\" Himes continued.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday, also said Trump did not properly notify Congress of the military action. He questioned how many American troops would remain on the ground and who would run Venezuela now that Maduro has been deposed.\"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said. \"The House and Senate must be briefed immediately and compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"",

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares trailed the market after Buffett announced in May he was retiring as some investors questioned whether Abel could manage the sprawling collection of businesses, along with an equity portfolio, in a similar fashion as Buffett, while commanding a premium valuation from the market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, 1 yearBuffett, who will remain chairman, noted that Abel is a sensible leader, who, like him, lives a normal life away from the spotlight.\"He's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he likes to play ice hockey with his kids,\" he said. \"If the neighbors didn't know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that on Jan. 1, he's going to be the decider on a company that employs close to 400,000 people, and has got plans to be around 50 or 100 years from now.\"The 95-year-old investor also signaled a quieter public role going forward, saying he will not take the stage at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting this year, a notable shift from a tradition that has drawn tens of thousands of investors to Omaha for decades.\"Everything will be the same,\" Buffett said. \"I will come in. I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

Jesus Vargas | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his wife and four other people with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday morning after the couple's dramatic capture by American forces in their own country.\"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment alleges.The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, the indictment also charges Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduoro Guerra, Diosado Cabello Rondon, Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Read the indictment here.\"Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,\" the indictment said.\"That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former  Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, the defendant.\"Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges four other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Rep.

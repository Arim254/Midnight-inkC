    "body": "watch nowOil prices jumped about 3% on Wednesday evening after the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, citing Moscow's \"lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine.\"Global benchmark Brent rose $1.83, 2.92%, to $64.42 per barrel by 8:18 p.m. ET. U.S crude oil rose $1.74, or 2.97%, to $60.24 per barrel. During regular trading Wednesday, Brent gained 2% to close at $62.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude climbed 2.2% to settle at $58.50.\"Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said as he announced the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil.\"Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump's effort to end yet another war,\" Bessent said. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"The Treasury Department said the new sanctions will harm the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue to fund its war against Ukraine.A senior White House official told NBC News that the new sanctions are related to plans for a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest falling through.Trump has also been trying to pressure India to stop purchasing Russian oil. New Delhi is one of the biggest purchasers of Russian crude exports.U.S. crude oil prices have fallen 16% this year and Brent is down nearly 14%. OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has been increasing production for months.Trade tensions caused by Trump's tariffs, meanwhile, have also raised worries in the oil market that economic growth will slow and hurt crude demand.A general view shows the oil refinery of the Lukoil company in Volgograd, Russia on April 22, 2022.Reuters Photographer | Reuters",

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5% for the fourth consecutive meeting Thursday, as policymakers continued to flag household debt as a key risk.The decision was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and followed the introduction of tighter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing.On Oct. 15, South Korean media reported that stricter property rules, including tighter loan limits, will now apply across all 25 districts of Seoul, as well as 12 more areas in the surrounding Gyeonggi Province.Previously, the tightened rules only applied to four of Seoul's 25 districts.Household debt remains a major concern for the Bank of Korea, which has been reluctant to cut rates for fear of fueling housing demand and pushing debt levels higher.Bank of America analysts wrote in an Oct. 20 note that \"housing inflation in Seoul has been the top of mind for policymakers this year, a critical constraint for additional easing in 2H25.\"They noted that home prices in central Seoul accelerated again in mid-September, despite earlier rounds of cooling measures in June and September.\"With such measures, a sequential decline in home transactions is expected in coming months, but it is still hard to tell if the price increase could be fully contained, in our view,\" they said.Stalled trade talksThe rate decision also came as South Korea faces uncertainty over its trade relationship with the U.S., after both sides struggled to finalize details of an agreement reached on July 30.Under the deal, the Asian nation is set to invest $350 billion in the U.S., but South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned in a Reuters interview that transferring the full amount in cash could trigger a financial crisis reminiscent of 1997.Negotiators are reportedly due to visit Washington this week to finalize terms ahead of the APEC Summit on Oct. 31 in South Korea.At its last meeting in August, the BOK raised its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% from its May forecast of 1.9%, while the GDP growth outlook for the year was also revised to 0.9% from 0.8% previously.It expects domestic demand to make a \"modest recovery,\" due to a supplementary budget and improvement in consumer sentiment.\"Exports are likely to show favorable movements for some time, but are likely to gradually slow as the impacts of U.S. tariffs expand,\" the central bank said.— This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",

    "body": "Steve Wozniak, co-founder of the technology company Apple.Thomas Banneyer | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesA group of prominent figures, including artificial intelligence and technology experts, has called for an end to efforts to create 'superintelligence' — a form of AI that would surpass humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. Over 850 people, including tech leaders like Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, signed a statement published Wednesday calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. The list of signatories was notably topped by prominent AI pioneers, including the computer scientists Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, who are widely considered \"godfathers\" of modern AI. Leading AI researchers like UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell also signed on. Superintelligence has become a buzzword in the AI world, as companies from Elon Musk's xAI to Sam Altman's OpenAI compete to release more advanced large language models. Meta notably has gone so far as to name its LLM division the 'Meta Superintelligence Labs.' But signatories of the recent statement warn that the prospect of superintelligence has \"raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"It called for a ban on developing superintelligence until there is strong public support for the technology and a scientific consensus that it can be built and controlled safely.In addition to AI and tech figures, the names behind the statement came from a broad coalition ranging from academics, media personalities, religious leaders and a bipartisan group of former U.S. politicians and officials. Those retired officials included former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.Meanwhile, Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck — influential media allies to U.S. President Donald Trump — were also prominently featured on the list.Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon speaks during the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025 at Conrad Washington on April 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesOther high-profile signatories included the British royal family members Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as well as former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. As of Wednesday, the list was still growing.AI doomers versus AI boomersThere has been a growing divide in the tech space between those who see AI as a powerful force for good, warranting unfettered development, and those who believe it's dangerous and in need of more regulation. However, as noted by the 'Statement on Superintelligence' signatory website, even the leaders of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, such as Musk and Altman, have, in the past, warned about the dangers of superintelligence. Before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Altman wrote in a 2015 blog post that \"development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.\"watch nowMeanwhile, Elon Musk said on a podcast earlier this year that there was \"only a 20% chance of annihilation\" when discussing the risks of advanced AI surpassing human intelligence. The 'Statement on Superintelligence' cited a recent survey from the Future of Life Institute showing that only 5% of U.S. adults support \"the status quo of fast, unregulated\" superintelligence development. The survey of 2,000 American adults also found that a majority believe \"superhuman AI\" shouldn't be created until proven safe or controllable and want robust regulation on advanced AI. In a statement provided on the site, computer scientist Bengio said AI systems could surpass most individuals in most cognitive tasks within a few years. He added that while such advances could help solve global challenges, they also carry significant risks.\"To safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design AI systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,\" he said. \"We also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future.\"",

He said the model was made using 13 different chatbots and that Airbnb is depending heavily on Alibaba's Qwen model.Chesky, who is a close friend of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, said it's only the beginning of the AI revolution and he expects the technology to fuel a consumer app craze over the next few years.\"We're all going to have to work together,\" he said. \"AI is going to lift up a lot of companies.

Kim | Chicago Tribune | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines on Wednesday posted a surprise profit for the third quarter and said it expects to generate record sales in the last three months of the year thanks to better travel demand and higher fares.The carrier said it expects unit revenue to rise between 1% and 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% over the same period last year.\"This guidance range assumes demand strength remains at current levels through the end of the quarter,\" Southwest said.Here's how Southwest performed in the period ended September 30 compared with Wall Street expectations, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 11 cents adjusted vs. loss of 3 cents expectedRevenue: $6.95 billion vs. $6.92 billion expectedIn July, Southwest joined other airlines in cutting its 2025 profit forecast. The Dallas carrier said it expected full-year earnings before taxes of $600 million to $800 million, down from an earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. It reaffirmed that earnings outlook on Wednesday.The carrier has been working to better compete with rivals and increase sales, abandoning longtime policies like open seating and two free checked bags for each traveler.Southwest CFO Tom Doxey told CNBC in an interview that increased sales from selling seat assignments would show up in the first quarter, when the first flights without open seating begin.Southwest's third-quarter profit fell more than 19% year over year to $54 million from $67 million. On a per-share basis, Southwest's earnings fell to 10 cents from 11 cents a year earlier.Adjusting for one-time items, Southwest reported $58 million in earnings for the third-quarter, or 11 cents a share. Revenue rose 1% to $6.95 billion from the year-earlier period. Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing gets FAA approval to hike 737 Max output Air traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit wins court approval for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alerts",

That shutdown stemmed from a dispute about funding Trump's contentious immigration policy.The current shutdown resulted from Senate Democrats refusing to vote for a short-term government funding bill sponsored by Republicans, because it lacks additional spending on health care and other provisions.That GOP-backed stopgap bill, which would resume funding at current levels until Nov. 21, failed to pass in the Senate for a 12th time Wednesday evening. The 54-46 vote fell mostly along party lines.Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Aaron Schartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished to make room for the massive ballroom that President Donald Trump is building, a senior White House official said Wednesday.The disclosure came three months after Trump promised that the East Wing's structure would not be touched to build the $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom.Images showing the demolition of part of the East Wing triggered public anger this week.\"Plans changed,\" the White House official told CNBC on Wednesday.That official cited \"structural reasons\" for the decision to knock down the entire East Wing.\"The East Wing will be more modern and beautiful than ever before,\" the official said, adding that it will be enjoyed by presidents and first ladies for years to come.It will include a \"big beautiful ballroom,\" the official said.The New York Times first reported the decision to demolish the entire wing of the White House.The demolition work should be completed by this weekend, an official told the Times.A model of the White House and proposed ballroom is displayed during a ballroom fundraising dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump in the East Room of the White House on October 15, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesIn July, Trump said the ballroom would be built next to the East Wing.\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said at the time.The White House on Tuesday dismissed the furor over the demolition as \"manufactured outrage\" and called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.The Treasury Department this week banned its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing, calling it a potential security risk. The department is located next to the White House with a clear view of the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will cover the costs of the ballroom. But it is still unclear who all the contributors are and how much they have agreed to pay for the project.\"The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly,\" the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday.Tech giant Alphabet is contributing $22 million to help build the ballroom under a legal settlement reached with Trump last month over his being banned from the company's YouTube platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by his supporters.A demolition crew takes apart the facade of the East Wing of the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed ballroom is being built, in Washington, D.C., October 21, 2025.  Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Google parent Alphabet's contribution in the form of the settlement, which was recorded in Oakland, California, federal court, represents nearly 10% of the estimated construction costs.The settlement notes that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Lockheed Martin confirmed to CNBC that it is contributing to the project, but declined to disclose the size of its donation.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson saidSources told CBS News in September that R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Palantir and NextEra Energy have also donated. CNBC has requested comment from those companies.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom. It is not clear how much Comcast is contributing. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company, Versant.Trump selected McCrery Architects to design the ballroom. The construction team is led by Clark Construction, and the engineering team is headed by AECOM, the White House said in July.",

    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in Oceanside, California, on May 15, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart is pausing the hiring of job candidates who need H-1B visas to work in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the decision, an example of the ways the Trump administration's immigration policies are shaping corporate strategy.Walmart's decision comes after President Donald Trump in September announced higher fees for the visas, which allow companies to temporarily hire skilled workers from other countries such as China and India. The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers' jobs and end abuse of the visa.In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, \"Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.\"Exceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. H-1B visas, which Congress created in 1990, have been a way for companies to bring in skilled workers from other countries when they can't find qualified applicants in the U.S. It's been frequently used for filling science, technology, engineering and math roles.The program has an annual cap of 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If demand is above the cap, a lottery system is used.For the Trump administration, the steeper fee on H-1Bs is intended as a deterrant for companies who are weighing whether to hire a foreign worker over an American. It fits into Trump's broader goal of using trade policy and an immigration crackdown to compel companies to invest in their U.S. operations and hire U.S.-born workers. Read moreWalmart is the nation's largest private employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company's big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart's corporate ranks. The retail giant's corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.Walmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.Yet the decision has faced pushback by some in the corporate world. Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.In a news release, the U.S. Chamber's Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee \"will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.\"Walmart's policy change was first reported by Bloomberg.",

Trump is a close ally of Argentina President Javier Milei, whose aggressive deregulation efforts have been celebrated by American conservatives. American soybean farmers and their advocates have slammed the financial lifeline for Buenos Aires because China, a top buyer of the staple crop, has moved its business from the U.S. to Argentina amid Trump's trade war.Argentina, in a move that coincided with Trump's pledge to help Milei, suspended export taxes last month.\"Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers' biggest market???\" Sen.

    "body": "Visitors are caught in the reflection of a store offering 50% off on all items on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica on July 16, 2024. Genaro Molina | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA steady stream of promotions across the fashion industry has left consumers suffering from \"discount burnout\" ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners released Wednesday. The firm surveyed more than 9,000 U.S. consumers on their preferences and priorities across 140 retailers and nine fashion sectors. The report found shoppers see price increases as \"inevitable,\" and cost has become less important to them when they are deciding whether to buy new clothes or accessories.On average, the value of importance respondents assigned to price dropped 13% compared with last year and fell across all sectors except for luxury and beauty, the survey found. Meanwhile, 30% fewer consumers ranked sales and finding the best deal as \"very important\" compared with last year, even in the off-price sector, where deal hunting fell from the top factor respondents were considering to number 19In the aftermath of President Donald Trump's tariff increases on dozens of countries in April, retailers leaned on discounts and promotions to alleviate consumer concerns that prices were rising because of trade policy, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author. But now there's \"fatigue\" around promotions and shoppers are looking for more than just a discount, she said. Consistent pricing between stores and online, value for the money, and quality are among the top things shoppers are prioritizing when spending, she said. They're also looking for a better store experience. While more than 60% of shoppers surveyed plan to make over half of their fashion purchases in stores this holiday, the amount of time shoppers are spending in stores dropped 3% and basket size fell 5% over the last two years, the report found. \"We have higher foot track traffic and lower baskets. Something's missing that they're not converting,\" said Lapinsky. \"So what is it about that experience in-store that's not helping them convert?\"The findings come as the retail industry prepares for a holiday shopping season that could be weaker than previous years amid falling consumer sentiment, an uncertain job market and persistent inflation. The tough economic backdrop coloring the holiday season is putting a renewed focus on execution, quality and brand strength, especially as many retailers raise prices to offset the cost of tariffs. Lapinsky said the survey's findings are a \"warning\" for retailers that discounts won't be enough to drive demand this holiday season. \"They've always had this lever of discount to drive traffic and get folks into the store, but when you're compounding it with tariffs and their need to raise prices … that lever for them is going to become even more risky,\" said Lapinsky. \"It's not necessarily going to work the way it has, because of this fatigue.\" The luxury sector, where price rose in importance for shoppers as a factor when they are spending, provides a cautionary tale for the retail industry, the report said. Over the last few years, brands \"dramatically raised prices,\" the firm said, citing Chanel's decision to increase the price of one of its bags from $5,800 to $11,300 between 2019 and 2025 as an example. The sudden spike led consumers to pull back from the sector and trade down to premium brands \"that felt more rationally priced,\" the report said. \"The same dynamic applies across other sectors,\" the report said. \"Retailers who attempt to hold the line on pricing by reducing quality risk losing credibility.\"",

Prices in all of the categories it tracked have risen by an average of $17 year over year. Jackets and outerwear saw the largest increase, with prices on average 24% higher, while swimwear saw the smallest hike at 2% on average. As the U.S. starts to cool down and winter approaches, consumers looking for new coats and jackets could be spending a lot more at the register – if they choose to buy. One factor that's weighed on the category is a late start to fall, which typically leads to weak demand for outerwear. Coupled with higher prices, retailers that bet big on outerwear in the fall and winter months might have a harder time moving product, which could lead to inventory challenges in the spring, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author.\"[Retailers] have a normal discounting cadence that says by late November, early December, you're already starting to put this stuff on sale, on discount, and a consumer may not have even thought about it by then,\" said Lapinsky.\"We've had so many discussions with retailers about the whole flow of their seasons, and some have made decisions to push some product out further because fall is starting to feel more like late summer,\" she added. \"Not all of them have been that reactive. So it's absolutely a cause for concern if they haven't made any adjustments.\"Here's how much prices have risen in the fashion industry by category. ",

Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are harnessing it to employ fewer people. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned that it will \"replace literally half of all white-collar workers.\" Salesforce's Marc Benioff claimed it's already doing up to 50% of the company's workload. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told The Wall Street Journal that it \"is going to change literally every job.\"The \"it\" that's on corporate America's lips is artificial intelligence.Less than three years into the generative AI boom, executives across every major industry are loudly telling employees and shareholders that, due to the technological revolution underway, the size and shape of their workforce is about to dramatically change, if it hasn't already.What started with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT and a novel new way for consumers to use chatbots has rapidly made its way into the enterprise, with companies employing customized AI agents to automate functions in customer support, marketing, coding, content creation and elsewhere.Recent estimates from Goldman Sachs suggest that 6% to 7% of U.S. workers could lose their jobs because of AI adoption. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab, using ADP employment data, found that entry-level hiring in \"AI exposed jobs\" has dropped 13% since large language models started proliferating. The report said software development, customer service and clerical work are the types of jobs most vulnerable to AI today.\"We are at the beginning of a multi-decade progress development that will have a major impact on the labor market,\" said Gad Levanon, chief economist at the Burning Glass Institute, a research firm that focuses on changes in the economy and workforce.Automation, of course, is nothing new. Every era has its printing press, ATM machine, self-checkout machine or online booking agency that's replaced human labor with some form of technology. In the process, new jobs emerge and economies adapt and evolve.A report from the World Economic Forum earlier this year estimated that the onslaught of AI, robotics and automation could displace 92 million jobs by 2030, while adding 170 million new roles. AI development, research, safety and implementation are all areas of growth, along with robotics.watch nowErik Brynjolfsson, director of the Stanford research group, said that, in addition to new types of roles, physical jobs such as health aids and construction workers are so far shielded from AI disruption.\"There's going to be more turbulence in both directions in the coming months and years,\" Brynjolfsson said in an interview. \"We need to prepare our workforce.\"The high-level data isn't yet showing massive changes.The U.S. government is three weeks into a shutdown, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics has gone dark. But alternative reports from organizations like the Chicago Fed have shown an economy that's plodding along. Employment growth is meek, but the labor market is holding steady.The unemployment rate held flat at 4.3% in September, according to the Chicago Fed, as did the rate for layoffs and other separations at 2.1%.A recent study published by the Budget Lab at Yale found no \"discernible disruption\" caused by ChatGPT. Martha Gimbel, co-founder of the lab, called the upheaval from AI \"minimal\" and \"incredibly concentrated,\" although that could shift as technological changes work through the broader economy.\"The rest of the economy often moves more slowly than Silicon Valley,\" she said.The New York Fed found in a survey last month that only 1% of services firms reported laying off workers because of AI in the last six months. The Society for Human Resource Management said its data shows that 6% of U.S. jobs have been automated by 50% or more, a number that rises to 32% for computer and math-related professions.'Scrappier teams'It doesn't take much prying to get corporate executives to talk about what's coming.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that his company's corporate workforce will shrink from AI over the next few years, and encouraged employees to learn how to use AI tools to eventually \"get more done with scrappier teams.\"The New York Times published an investigative piece on Tuesday, showing that Amazon's automation team expects that it can avoid hiring more than 160,000 people in the U.S. by 2027, equaling savings of about 30 cents on every item that Amazon packs and delivers. The report was based on interviews and internal strategy documents, the Times said.An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, in response to the report, that the documents offer an \"incomplete and misleading picture of our plans.\"\"In this instance, the materials appear to reflect the perspective of just one team and don't represent our overall hiring strategy across our various operations business lines - now or moving forward,\" the spokesperson said in an email. Palantir CEO Alex Karp told CNBC in August that his data analytics company, which has seen its market cap soar more than elevenfold in the past two years, aims to grow revenue by 10 times and reduce its head count by about 12%. He didn't provide a timeframe for reaching that goal.The message is making its way across the tech industry.Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, said last month that his software company has cut the number of customer support roles from 9,000 to 5,000 \"because I need less heads.\" Swedish fintech firm Klarna said it has downsized its workforce by 40% as it adopts AI. Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke told employees in April that they'll be expected to prove why they \"cannot get what they want done using AI\" before asking for more head count and resources.Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCoding assistants have been some of the early winners of the generative AI rush, becoming the first real application type to attract a hefty number of paying users. The Information reported last week that Anysphere, the parent of Cursor, is in talks to raise funds at a $27 billion valuation, as it takes on Microsoft's GitHub and other startups, including Replit, in an increasingly crowded market.Software development is just the beginning.In banking, JPMorgan's managers have been told to avoid hiring people as the firm deploys AI across its businesses, CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts last week. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said that as his bank incorporates AI, it will be \"taking a front-to-back view of how we organize our people, make decisions, and think about productivity and efficiency.\"Then there's the auto sector.When Ford CEO Farley told Walter Isaacson in an interview in July that \"AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind,\" he was reflecting a sentiment that's growing across his industry. According to a survey of 500 U.S. car dealers conducted by marketing solutions firm Phyron, half of respondents said they expect AI to sell vehicles autonomously by 2027.\"That means AI creating the marketing assets, handling listings, answering buyer questions, negotiating deals, arranging finance, and completing the sale — all without human input,\" Phyron said in the report on its survey results last month.The topic will likely get a lot of attention in the next couple weeks as the world's biggest tech companies issue quarterly results and update investors on their AI deployments.

Still, the stock dropped about 6% in extended trading.Here's how the company performed versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: $2.65 adjusted vs. $2.45 expectedRevenue: $16.33 billion vs. $16.09 billion expected.Revenue increased 9% from about $15 billion in the year-ago period, IBM said. The company reported net income of $1.74 billion, or $1.84 per share, after recording a loss of $330 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. The results from last year included the impact of a $2.7 billion pension settlement charge.\"Clients globally continue to leverage our technology and domain expertise to drive productivity in their operations and deliver real business value with AI,\" CEO Arvind Krishna said in release.IBM upped its revenue guidance and said it now expects \"more than\" 5% revenue growth, up from \"at least\" 5%. Free cash flow for the year is expected to hit $14 billion, up from a $13.5 billion estimate last quarter.Krishna also said the company's AI book of business has surpassed $9.5 billion, up from $7.5 billion during the second quarter.Like many technology companies, IBM has harnessed AI to streamline productivity and slash costs. In May, Krishna told the Wall Street Journal that it replaced 200 human resources roles.IBM's software revenue rose 10% to $7.21 billion, meeting a StreetAccount estimate. Consulting revenue totaled $5.3 billion, surpassing a $5.24 billion projection.Infrastructure, which includes its mainframe computers business, jumped 17% to $3.6 billion.IBM's board also approved a $1.68 per share quarterly dividend.Correction: Due to a typo, an earlier version of this story had an incorrect figure of the company's AI book of business.

    "body": "watch nowGE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik said he has had conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman multiple times over the past few weeks as power scarcity remains a challenge and opportunity for hypescalers.\"I met with Sam multiple times over the past few weeks. It is a relationship that continues to evolve,\" Strazik told CNBC in a phone interview Wednesday, following the release of the company's third-quarter results. \"I've been with his team over the last 72 hours. Clearly, OpenAI is a critical piece of this growth trajectory with a lot of ambition.\"Strazik said the talks have focused on OpenAI's power needs, \"both with power generation and the electrical equipment required to do it.\"GE Vernova shares fell about 6% on Wednesday. The company's third-quarter results topped expectations, helped by a 55% increase in power equipment orders. However, the company didn't raise its 2025 forecast, disappointing some investors. Also, onshore wind remains soft, but analysts say that was largely expected due to ongoing regulatory hurdles.Melius Research analyst Rob Wertheimer told CNBC there was nothing negative in this report.The \"bar was set high,\" he said, noting that GE Vernova shares have doubled over the past year.Wall Street remains optimistic about GE Vernova capitalizing on growing demand from big tech. According to LSEG, the average analyst price target is $658, or about 20% higher than where the stock is trading now.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGE Vernova shares year to dateThe company has quickly become the key power equipment provider to every major hyperscaler including OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Google, XAI, according to people familiar to the situation.According to Strazik, $900 million in electrical equipment orders have come from the hyperscalers year to date versus $600 million in orders in all of 2024.\"When we add in Q4 orders, our electric equipment orders will be directionally double with them [hyperscalers],\" Strazik said.Analysts say some of the key challenges GE Vernova is facing right now are capacity constraints, evolving tariff policy and regulations that have slowed down orders for onshore wind turbines.GE Vernova is mostly sold out of its power generation equipment through 2028, Strazik said. The company has ballparked $300 million to $400 million in tariff-related costs this year. At the company's upcoming investor day in early November, Strazik is expected to detail more forward looking numbers.The company also has $8 billion of cash and no debt, which means it's keeping an eye out for opportunities, Strazik said.On Tuesday, GE Vernova said it would buy the 50% it didn't already own in transformer manufacturer Prolec GE for more than $5 billion. Transformers are key to increasing power voltage to accelerate transportation of electricity.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWestern Alliance, one of the regional banks at the center of concerns over loans made to non-bank financial players, said Wednesday it believes the loan that sparked last week's selloff is an isolated case.The bank reported third-quarter earnings Tuesday afternoon and noted it had set aside $30 million in reserves for possible losses on a $98 million loan made to the Cantor Group. Last week, Western Alliance disclosed that it had sued the borrowers behind the Cantor Group for alleged fraud related to the collateral for the loans.\"While incredibly frustrating, we believe this is a one-off issue in our note finance business and have adjusted our onboarding and ongoing portfolio monitoring practices,\" Western Alliance CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts on Wednesday.Shares of Western Alliance rose almost 2% in midday trading.Regional banks are getting a reprieve this week after Western Alliance and Zions, which also had exposure to the alleged loan fraud, reported results that didn't include any new loan meltdowns. Each of the banks posted rising hauls from net interest income on lower funding costs, while some of their metrics around credit quality actually improved from previous quarters.The Cantor Group episode forced Western Alliance to review other loans in its note finance portfolio, Vecchione said Wednesday.\"Today we have reverified titles and liens for all notes greater than $10 million and have found no irregularities,\" he said.Analysts grilled Vecchione during the Wednesday call for more details around the bank's loan collateral and lending to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs.\"What are you doing to validate your collateral and safeguard against future frauds?\" Autonomous Research analyst Casey Haire asked. \"It just seems like as long as you're not afraid to go to jail, it seems easy to double pledge collateral.\"Besides the recent review, Western Alliance periodically checks collateral to make sure the bank is still in a position to collect if the loan sours, executives said. Much of the bank's NDFI book is tied to residential mortgages, which Western Alliance considers low-risk, they added.'Can't unsee'Western Alliance is also exposed to another recent blowup, the bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands.But in this case, a loan facility made to a fund managed by a subsidiary of the investment bank Jefferies \"remains current, and we continue to receive principal and interest payments as modeled,\" said Vecchione.While this week's reassurances have calmed markets for now, the sharp selloff in regionals last week is leaving a lasting mark on the industry. Shares of both Western Alliance and Zions plunged on Thursday after the banks disclosed problems with the Cantor Group.Investors are ready to hit \"sell\" on any signs that the losses aren't isolated, and share gains for the group will be capped for the foreseeable future because of these worries, said Timur Braziler, who covers mid-cap banks for Wells Fargo. He cut his recommendation on Western Alliance to \"sell\" on September 29.\"You can't unsee these events,\" Braziler said in an interview. \"The timer for any kind of sustainable outperformance within the regional group has gotten reset once again.\"",

    "body": "With 2026 around the corner, many people are eyeing tips and tricks to bring into the new year at home and at work.And while many are considering a new morning or evening routine, there are two other routines you might want to incorporate into your schedule, specifically at work, to better focus when you need to and disconnect at the end of the day, says Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and author of several books on focus and productivity.Newport is a proponent of using time blocking to reserve time during your day for deep work, meaning the tasks that are most cognitively demanding.The first routine Newport recommends is for the run-up to a deep work block.\"Our brain is not wired for sustained concentration on an abstract or symbolic topic,\" Newport says. \"Give your brain time, give it some help shifting over into deep work mode because it's a very unnatural thing you're asking your brain to do.\"Many workers are constantly bombarded with notifications throughout their day. A Microsoft report from April found that employees are interrupted every 2 minutes by emails, meetings or pings. The brain is in a very different state managing all of that digital noise than when you're zeroed in on deep work, so it takes to switch between these modes.Before a deep work block on your calendar, you might take a quick walk around the block, make tea, or clean your desk — something you can repeat and use as a signal to your brain it's time to switch modes. Think of it like stretching before you go on a run.\"You can't just shut down your inbox, open Microsoft Word and think, 'Now I'm focused,'\" Newport says.At the end of your workday, you also need a shutdown routine.\"It's a way of clearing out your brain after work so it's not going to be held partially hostage by work thoughts for your time outside of work,\" Newport says.His shutdown routine as he signs off at the end of his workday includes doing a final inbox check, looking ahead on his work calendar and writing down any reminders.At the end of it, you should feel, \"We're in a good place, there's nothing else I need to figure out tonight, we're on track for the things we need to get done.\" Then, you should have \"some sort of visible shutdown statement or routine to indicate you've finished.\" Newport, for example, checks off a box that says \"Shutdown complete\" as the last step.A shutdown routine won't magically put an end to your work anxiety, but it can \"help teach your brain to slow down work ruminations.\"\"Instead of engaging with the ruminations, you say I checked that checkbox and I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't gone through everything and convinced myself we're in a good position to shut down for the day,\" Newport says.\"It prevents you from the temptation of maybe I should just go check my inbox,\" he adds. \"It helps you move on from work in a way that eventually your brain learns so you can get more out of your life outside work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A 2025 poll from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan asked American parents of children ages one to 18 about their views on various child health topics including bullying, internet safety, lack of physical activity, parental stress and diet.The Mott poll report, released in August, found that a majority of parents surveyed, 69%, think the physical health of American children and teens is getting worse. And even more parents are worried about their kids' emotional wellbeing: 83% believe the mental health of U.S. children and teens is also on the decline.Results of the poll also show that parents believe social media, too much screen time, and internet safety to be some of the top concerns kids are facing today.\"Since the increased use of social media starting around 2010, the prevalence of mental health problems in youth has also increased significantly,\" according to the report. \"This increase, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts continued through the COVID-19 pandemic years.\"Jonathan Haidt, social scientist and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is one of the many experts sounding an alarm about the connection between increased anxiety and depression among young people and smartphones and social media.\"All these devices are designed to keep kids scrolling for hours and hours,\" he previously told CNBC Make It. \"The average screen time is eight to 10 hours, not including school.\" \"We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy,\" he said.Haidt encourages parents to be more intentional about reducing their child's use of devices and social media. Here, he and Jean Twenge, a psychology professor and author of \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" offer up some recommendations for how parents can work to get that done.No smartphones before high schoolHaidt argues for a clear boundary: Kids should not get a smartphone before they reach high school. A global study of 27,969 18-to-24-year-olds by nonprofit Sapien Labs found that mental wellbeing improved the older the age of first ownership of a smartphone. Haidt also recommends parents refrain from enabling the use of social media on kids' phones before the age of 16.When kids get their devices, Haidt suggests parents have a designated place for them.\"They live on the kitchen counter,\" Haidt said as an example. \"If you need it, you check it out.\"No screens in the bedroom overnight Twenge advocates for keeping screens out of the bedroom overnight.\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" Twenge previously told CNBC Make It.Devices in the bedroom can disrupt children's sleep, whether they're up late scrolling or their notifications are waking them up. \"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge wrote in her book \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World.\"Haidt would go a step further: no screens in the bedroom whatsoever, he said.More free play outside To ensure kids don't get too sucked into their devices, Haidt also recommends parents encourage them to spend time outside with friends.Communities can decide to enact what he calls \"free play Fridays.\"\"Everyone knows that's when kids get together at the park, they play baseball, football, whatever,\" he previously told Make It. \"Maybe they just stay at the school playground.\"Ultimately, playing with friends and without screens is \"the most fun kids can have,\" he said. They might have so much, they'll ask to continue spending time with their friends over the weekend. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "This is the season when everyone's planning for next year. When it comes to money, I can assure you that the secret isn't in some fancy investing tactic, hot stock tip, or obscure cryptocurrency. If you and your partner set just one money resolution for 2026, make it this: You both stay actively involved in your finances.As a financial advisor for more than 20 years who's operated my own wealth management firm for nine, I know that this is the single most impactful commitment most couples can make. Yet it's missing in so many relationships. The dangers of disconnecting Leaving the money to be handled by one spouse leaves your family vulnerable. If something happens to the person handling everything (illness, death, or even divorce), the other is left to scramble. I've helped heartbroken spouses try to piece together accounts, passwords, and plans during the worst moments imaginable, and I wouldn't wish this outcome upon anyone. But even in less dramatic circumstances, it's still ineffective to leave one overwhelmed person to make all the decisions. You miss out on the power of two perspectives, and the disengaged spouse loses their agency and confidence. I've sat across from countless couples who, even with the best intentions, have lost the plot over time. Most of them never addressed the subtle shifts in their dynamic that made it easier for one partner to take the lead with their money. I'd often end up with just one client at our financial planning meetings, and their partner, I was told, was too busy, disinterested, apprehensive, or overwhelmed to join us. For a long time, I didn't understand why, until it happened in my own home. 'This isn't working anymore'During the pandemic, my wife, Heather, was juggling too much: lawyering in the general counsel's office of a Fortune 100 company, moonlighting as my business consultant for my wealth management firm, and keeping me and our two daughters clothed, fed, entertained, and safe. As a result of the physical, mental, and emotional labor she was carrying for all of us, she disconnected from our household finances. Money felt like the one thing she didn't have to worry about. In truth, it was the one thing I was willing to own from start to finish, and it was damaging to our relationship. I'm grateful she had the courage to say, \"This isn't working anymore.\" The tough conversations that followed caused us to rethink what we wanted out of our careers, how we divided labor, and how we could approach money as a team again. Make yourselves a money teamTalking about money is never just about money, which inspired Heather and me to spend two years interviewing other couples for our new book, \"Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.\" Effective communication is the bedrock. Here are some ways to connect with intention, move beyond the numbers, and engage in your finances together — even when it's the harder thing to do.Start with an honest review. Schedule a distraction-free time and place to get into everything. Do you both have access to your accounts? Are all passwords saved in your password managers? You should both have a baseline understanding of your net worth. Review what you earn (cash flow), what you have (assets and investments), what you owe (debt), and what you want (goals). Examine time, from each of your perspectives. Ask whether each of you feels you have the time to do what you want and need to do. You may need to shuffle responsibilities and automate or outsource less-critical tasks to free up time for finances. Create a regular practice. Make recurring money dates non-negotiable. We suggest having them quarterly, which won't become overwhelming and will create enough space between meetings to recognize real progress.  Meet your partner where they are. I've often encountered couples where one partner has less knowledge or comfort with all things finances than the other, and that, in part, is why they've disengaged. It can feel daunting. Tailor your approach to your partner's learning style, checking in to see what resonates.Bring in outside help if needed. A neutral financial advisor or therapist who specializes in money dynamics can guide tough conversations without bias, and offer financial advice that's tailored to your specific situation. When Heather and I finally reconnected around money, it secured our wallets and also deepened our relationship. Make 2026 the year you prioritize staying connected to your finances together — I know from experience just how transformative it can be. Douglas A.

    "body": "Businesswoman working on laptop in modern office spaceMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesStudent debt has long been considered difficult, if not impossible, to discharge in bankruptcy. But that hasn't been the case in recent years, a new study finds. The success rate for student loan borrowers who attempt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy has \"jumped\" to 87%, according to an analysis published in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal this month by Jason Iuliano, a professor at the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law. In 2017, the success rate for education debt holders in bankruptcy was 61%, and in 2007, it was 40%, Iuliano found. \"People who file for discharge are winning at very high rates,\" Iuliano told CNBC. His study used a final dataset of 652 bankruptcy discharge cases from October 2022 to November 2023 that included student loans.

What you can expectHere's the inflation breakdown for November 2025 — in one chartCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe improved outcomes for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy stem, in large part, from updated bankruptcy guidelines the Biden administration issued. In November 2022, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice rolled out a policy that experts say treats student loans more like other types of debt in bankruptcy court. Borrowers can fill out a 15-page attestation form, detailing their financial struggles and making their case for a mulligan. The Trump administration has not rescinded that guidance. The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, government data shows.Easier process is 'life-changing' for someAmid concerns that young people would try to avoid their financial obligations, policymakers began passing laws in the mid-1970s that raised the bar for discharging student debt in court. Government attorneys battled the cases, and some people needed to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" and \"undue hardship.\" Malissa Giles, a bankruptcy attorney in Virginia, said the easier bankruptcy process has been \"life-changing\" for her clients, many of whom have carried their student debt for decades. \"It allows them to sleep at night,\" she said. Women made up 73% of the student loan bankruptcy filers in the cases Iuliano reviewed. The average student loan balance for the filers was $115,000, but 10% of the borrowers owed more than $240,000. The debtors ranged in age from 24 to 76. Student debt not dischargeable is a 'myth' While the odds for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy have slowly improved, many people still don't bother to file the separate lawsuit required for the discharge of student debt, called an adversary proceeding, Iuliano found. More than 3 million student loan borrowers filed for bankruptcy between 2011 and 2024. But only 7,293 of those individuals took the additional step of requesting a student loan discharge, he writes in his study. \"The myth that student loans are never dischargeable in bankruptcy is so pervasive that many attorneys never even raise the possibility with their clients,\" Iuliano told CNBC.  \"However, the new attestation process is so streamlined that bankruptcy attorneys should be recommending it to every client with student loans,\" he said. Bankruptcy can be 'the only real path out' The easier bankruptcy process may offer a lifeline to many Americans struggling with education debt. Student loan holders have been under pressure from a weakening labor market, a barrage of changes to the lending system and recent trouble accessing relief programs, including debt forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the Education Department recently confirmed to CNBC. \"For many people, interest and fees have turned the balance into something they can never repay, so bankruptcy is the only real path out,\" Iuliano said.

Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

    "body": "A general view shows the logo of South Korean online delivery service Coupang, at a building housing the company's headquarters in Seoul on Dec. 9, 2025.Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korean online retail giant Coupang said it will offer 1.69 trillion South Korean won ($1.17 billion) in compensation to 34 million users affected by a massive data breach disclosed last month.The company said in a statement Monday local time that it planned to provide customers with purchase vouchers totaling 50,000 won for various Coupang services.Former customers who closed their Coupang accounts following the data breach are also eligible to receive the vouchers. Coupang said users can check their eligibility for the vouchers starting Jan. 15, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.Harold Rogers, interim CEO for Coupang Corp., described the move as a \"responsible measure for our customers,\" and said the company would \"fulfill its responsibilities to the end.\" \"I once again deeply apologize to our customers,\" he said in the statement. Rogers' apology came a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom also apologized, saying that he was \"devastated\" by the disappointment people have experienced. The data breach, which was revealed on Nov. 18, led to the resignation of CEO Park Dae-jun earlier this month.Coupang founder Kim Bom said in a separate statement that the company had failed to communicate clearly from the outset of the incident.The U.S.-based chairman acknowledged his apology was \"overdue,\" explaining that he initially believed it was best to communicate publicly and apologize only after all the facts were confirmed.\"In retrospect, this was a poor judgment. While Coupang worked tirelessly to resolve the situation, I should have expressed my deepest regrets and sincere apologies from the beginning. My heart has been heavy ever since I first learned of the data breach,\" Kim said.Kim added that the company has recovered all the leaked customer information through cooperation with the government, as well as the storage devices belonging to a suspect behind the data breach.He also said the customer information stored on the suspect's computer was limited to 3,000 records and that it was not distributed or sold externally. watch now",

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

Ukranian Presidency | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkraine's president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, said Monday that he has asked for up to 50 years' worth of security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the weekend.Commenting on the talks with Trump in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy told journalists that he said a meeting with Russia would only be possible after the president and European leaders had agreed on a framework peace deal for Ukraine. The comments, reported by Reuters on Monday, included Zelenskyy stating that he had asked for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, but that the current 20-point peace plan envisaged guarantees — aimed at deterring future Russian aggression — for 15 years.

Any peace plan should be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, he added, noting that any vote to approve or reject the agreement should be held during a 60-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy said \"Russia clearly does not want a ceasefire for now\" after several days of heavy drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's comments come after talks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Sunday. Trump said the discussions had gone well but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy described the talks as a \"really great discussion\" in which security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, but Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.watch nowWhen asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia and has rejected security guarantees for Kyiv so far. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls for the Donbas, which is mostly but not fully occupied by Russian forces, to be handed to Moscow. It's unclear whether Zelenskyy would meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a peace agreement was agreed in principle, with both leaders vehemently refusing to meet in the past.Trump said he had spoken with Putin about peace proposals during a phone conversation on Sunday but signalled that Russia had not appeared to support a ceasefire to allow for a referendum in Ukraine. He divulged few other details about the call, which he said lasted two hours. When asked to comment on the U.S.-Ukraine talks which followed that call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: \"We don't know how they went. We can't judge. After these talks, the two presidents — I mean the President of Russia and the President of the United States — agreed to have a phone call again. Then we'll get the information.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting to this story.",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk speaks at a Q&A session following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | Pool | ReutersThree months ago Oracle named Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as its new CEOs. They're off to a rough start.Oracle shares have plummeted 30% so far this quarter. With four trading days remaining in the period, the stock is on pace for its sharpest decline since 2001 and the dot-com bust. Investors have grown skeptical about the database software vendor's ability to open more server farms for ChatGPT operator OpenAI, which agreed in September to spend more than $300 billion with Oracle.Earlier this month, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and free cash flow. On the earnings call, newly appointed finance leader Doug Kehring called for $50 billion in fiscal 2026 capital expenditures, 43% higher than the plan in September and double the total from a year earlier. Additionally, Oracle is plotting $248 billion in leases to boost cloud capacity, on top of building data centers.Such growth will require boatloads of debt. In September, Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. Kehring committed on the earnings call to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. But some skeptical investors are betting otherwise, pushing up the prices of Oracle's credit default swaps.\"Considering Oracle is already barely hanging on to an investment grade rating, we would be concerned about Oracle's ability to live up to these obligations without restructuring its OpenAI contract,\" analysts at D.A. Davidson wrote in a note to clients on Dec. 12. They have the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. Oracle declined to comment.watch nowMagouyrk and Sicilia's tenure began at a time of historic optimism. About two weeks before they took the reins from Safra Catz, Oracle reported a 359% revenue backlog tied heavily to OpenAI's commitment. That deal represented a major endorsement for Oracle, which was left off Gartner's list of top five cloud infrastructure providers by revenue for 2024.Following reports about the OpenAI agreement on Sept. 10, Oracle's stock shot up almost 36%, the third-sharpest rally since the company's 1986 IPO. The shares reached an intraday record of $345.72.\"We think $340 was terrifying,\" said Zachary Lountzis, vice president at Lountzis Asset Management, in an interview. Lountzis held $25 million in Oracle shares as of Sept. 30, according to a filing.The stock has since lost 43% of its value, closing on Wednesday at $197.49, though it got a bump last Friday after TikTok said it had agreed to sell part of its U.S. business to Oracle and other investors. Oracle has for years delivered cloud services to TikTok.Not 'betting against Larry'Lountzis said his team first bought Oracle shares in 2020, when the stock was below $60. It's held onto it stake through the recent highs and lows, picking up another roughly 30,000 shares in the first quarter of this year.\"Our philosophy is that we're OK with short-term overvaluation if the economics of the business have not changed, and that was the case with Oracle,\" Lountzis said. \"We didn't feel the economics of the business changed with all the largely positive news that came out. And I think what we've seen from $340 down to $180 is actually a very healthy correction.\" For Lountzis, much of his trust in the company comes down to Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle in 1977 and is now the world's second-richest person, according to Bloomberg.\"You would have gone bankrupt 40 times betting against Larry over the last 50 years,\" Lountzis said. \"He sees the future.\"watch nowIn October, Sicilia, Magouyrk and Kehring laid out a vision for a much faster-growing Oracle, with revenue set to step up to $225 billion in the 2030 fiscal year from $57 billion in fiscal 2025. Most of that growth will come from artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Nvidia's graphics processing units at the center of it. But while Magouryk was telling analysts to prepare for \"hypergrowth,\" such expansion would come at the expense of profitability, because Oracle's core software business commands much higher margins.  In fiscal 2021, Oracle's gross margin was 77%. Analysts polled by FactSet see it falling to about 49% in 2030, with about $34 billion in total negative free cash flow over the next five years before that figure turns positive in 2029.Eric Lynch, managing director at Florida's Suncoast Equity Management, said it's hard as an investor to get comfortable with Oracle's plans. \"Four or five years is a long time,\" Lynch said. \"That's just not within our investment discipline.\"Lynch also said he's worried about such heavy dependance on OpenAI, which is burning cash at a rapid rate and has committed to more than $1.4 trillion in total AI build-outs and investments. \"Will the demand be there from OpenAI?\" Lynch said.Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turrin launched coverage of Oracle earlier this month with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $280 price target. He said the industry's perception will likely improve if Oracle follows through with OpenAI, which could account for more than one-third of the company's revenue by 2029, according to Turrin's estimate. \"They're kind of shifting away from more of a value-oriented business to a more growth-oriented business,\" Turrin said.A big challenge for Oracle remains picking up market share in cloud infrastructure, where the company badly trails Amazon, Microsoft and Google even though its customer roster includes names like Meta, Uber and Elon Musk's xAI.Databricks, which was just valued at $134 billion in a funding round, doesn't make its popular data processing software available on Oracle's cloud. That will happen \"when customers start banging on my door, saying, 'You need to run on Oracle,'\" Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview. \"Maybe it's getting there, but we just haven't heard that.\"Databricks rival Snowflake hasn't brought its services to Oracle either.Turrin said that Oracle's credibility in the market will hinge on the success of its AI build-out. \"Then customers start to look at this and say, wow, this company was trusted to build some of the largest training clusters in the world, and they're delivering on them,\" Turrin said. \"We should take a look at that too and figure out what's happening here.\" WATCH: How the massive power draw of generative AI is overtaxing our gridwatch now",

    "body": "Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaJames Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiArtificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed, forcing a rethink of how the power-hungry servers behind the boom can coexist with — and draw less from — the environment.Data centers form the backbone of the internet, underpinnning nearly every digital service. But the facilities require huge amounts of energy and water, and are often considered an eyesore and a burden on the communities that house them. As more AI workloads are scaled into the facilities, the pressure on power supply chains will intensify.There's going to be a \"tipping point,\" where the architecture of data centers will no longer be fit for purpose, Simone Larsson, head of enterprise AI at Lenovo, told CNBC.In the face of a looming digital infrastructure crisis, tech giants and developers of the expensive infrastructure are exploring sustainable and out-of-the-box solutions.Data spas and villagesTraditional data centers are failing to efficiently power AI workloads and falling short of sustainability targets and compliance demands, according to the \"Data Center of the Future\" November study carried out by Lenovo in partnership with Opinium. The study found that the majority of IT decision makers prioritize technology partners who reduce energy, but only 46% of those surveyed said their current data center designs supported sustainability goals. In the face of those challenges, Lenovo has worked with architects from Mamou-Mani and engineers from AKT II to design data centers that can integrate better with the environment and address energy limitations. The outcome: designs that see data centers sequestered underground by utilizing disused tunnels or bunkers, or suspended in the air to make use of 24/7 energy from solar power.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center bunker that utilizes disused tunnels or transport systems.James Cheung, Mamou-ManiIn so-called data villages, servers are stacked in a modular format near urban areas, allowing excess heat from the data centers to be transferred to power local amenities like schools or homes. The same goes for data center spas, which would see excess heat from data centers used in a wellbeing setting. The heat generated by the spa could in turn be repurposed to power cooling technology for the data center.But there's a catch: even Lenovo admits its designs will likely not be feasible until 2055 or later. The company said its study was designed to spark discussion and acknowledged that significant regulatory changes would be required before any such designs could be deployed. The cost and engineering complexity of some of the concepts, as well as legal and scalability constraints, also present challenges.Adoption would also vary widely by region. The U.S., for example, is more likely to adopt large-scale, ultra-high-density campuses due to high demand, more available land, and a relatively flexible regulatory environment, said Perkins Liu, senior research analyst at S&P Global's 451 Research. Meanwhile, Europe has a more constrained grid and stricter regulations, he said.That's not to say that novel data center designs are an entirely new concept. In 2018, Microsoft deployed a submarine-like data center 117 feet below sea level to take advantage of the cooling benefits of seawater and tidal power to enable the project to be powered fully by renewable energy.There are also many examples of operators redistributing heat from the facilities to warm nearby residences. Last summer, excess heat from an Equinix data center was used to heat the Olympic swimming pools in Paris.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaServers in spaceFrom Google's \"moonshot\" Suncatcher project, Alibaba and Zhejiang Lab's \"Three-Body Computing Constellation\" initiative, to Nvidia's Starcloud — the orbital data center race is heating up. Smaller players including Edge Aerospace and Loft Orbital are also exploring the tech.It might seem like the stuff of science fiction — and indeed, Google cites a short story from science fiction writer Isaac Asimov as inspiration for its idea to tap directly into the sun as a source of energy – but these proposals are being explored more concretely by tech giants.The EU-funded ASCEND study, in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, explored the feasibility of launching centers into orbit using robotic technologies.Thales Alenia Space is now developing the technology required for this process with the goal of conducting a first in-orbit demonstration mission in 2028. In November, Starcloud, the startup backed by Nvidia, sent a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before.Around 70 million euros ($82 million) of private capital has been invested in space-based data center projects since 2020, according to a report from the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI). However, in the near term, orbital data centers remain out of reach as the cost of sending such equipment into space remains a significant barrier.\"Radiation-hardened hardware, cooling in the vacuum of space, and the extremely high cost of launching large, power-dense compute systems into orbit are major hurdles,\" said S&P Global's Liu. Challenges also include reliable high-speed communication, space debris, and the difficulties of maintenance, he said.ESPI's cost model for data centers depends on the success of Starship's launch price being as low as $10 million.\"If you asked me now, this is unrealistic in the near-term,\" said Jermaine Gutierrez, research fellow at ESPI. \"In the long run, however, the question is whether terrestrial developments and continued cost savings thereof, outpace the cost savings from deployment in space.\"'Faceless mega-juggernauts' Lenovo's Larsson said that its futuristic data center plans have co-existence and \"symbiosis\" at their core. This includes leveraging some of the heat from the data centers for use in the community and by other involved stakeholders.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-Mani, told CNBC that another goal was to make the facilities more visually appealing so that they aren't viewed as \"faceless mega-juggernauts of boxes.\" The Data Village involves a modular, stackable brick or pod system of data centers linked to city needs. Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagined the data centers of the future.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiHe explained how the architects used techniques like biomimicry to explore how natural algorithms can show the most efficient ways to disperse heat.\"We interact with [data centers] every day, with our computers and with our phones. But this gentle giant, in the background, is putting massive pressure on water and our resources,\" he said.Future proofingIn order for many of these innovations to take place, experts told CNBC that regulation will need to be amended and new policies implemented to address the growing energy demands of AI and data centers.\"Data center operators could adopt green technologies at their wish, but it will have to be justified financially,\" said S&P Global's Liu. He added that the grid will need to be upgraded and renewable energy needs to be built out quickly for this to happen.watch nowSimply retrofitting data centers won't always work, said Lenovo's Larsson, as it leaves operators \"trying to enter into a cycle that's been broken to begin with.\"Instead, companies will need to think outside of the box and try to \"figure out what regulatory constraints would need to be flexed in order to not only serve the people on the planet but also the profits [of companies],\" she said.",

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

Peak to trough, silver plunged 15%, a parabolic move that is the biggest high-to-low change going back to August 2020 when it dropped 16.85%. \"This is a historic move,\" said Jeff Kilburg, CEO and chief investment officer of KKM Financial. \"We haven't seen a move like this in a long time.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver futures for March, year to dateHe attributed the pullback to profit-taking, as well as tax-loss harvesting at the end of a calendar year, that dented silver's advance after its huge run-up this year. The precious metal is still higher by more than 140% year to date. It started 2025 trading just above $20 per ounce.That has helped the precious metal outperform even gold this year. Gold futures for February, which recently topped $4,550 for the first time ever this month, are higher by more than 60% this year. Gold futures were last down by 4.6% on the day. There are a number of reasons for the huge gains. Alongside gold, silver is viewed as a safe haven for investors wary of heightened geopolitical tensions and other risks, like the ballooning U.S. deficit. The two metals are also viewed as stores of value, meaning they can act as hedges against a U.S. dollar that weakens due to inflation or economic uncertainty. Additionally, a weaker greenback also makes the assets cheaper for other countries, driving up demand. What's more, silver benefited from strong industrial demand for electronics such as solar panels, data centers and electric vehicles.KKM Financial's Kilburg expects those tail winds can continue to push silver higher in 2026. He thinks silver can climb to $90 or even $100, implying upside of roughly 27% or 40%, respectively, from where it was last trading. \"I think this is a reset, a reprieve, just a one-day end-of-year move. But I think both precious metals — gold and silver — continue their trajectory higher,\" said Kilburg. \"There's a dramatic supply issue. There's a tremendous demand issue. And you couple those two together, that is going to push silver higher,\" he said. \"So, I don't think the rally is over by any means.\" — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report. ",

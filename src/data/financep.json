    "body": "A recruiter displays information while speaking to a jobseeker during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJanuary job gains were better than anything the U.S. economy saw in 2025 but not still enough to sound an all-clear on what has otherwise been a stagnant labor market.With a gain of 130,000 nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.3%, the lowest since August, the numbers indicated that hiring is at least hanging in there while layoffs appear contained.However, beneath the hood there were some trouble spots: A continued concentration in just a few fields where hiring is happening; revisions that meant virtually no gains in the second half of 2025, and questions over what happens from here as companies contend with a high level of uncertainty.\"I would anticipate that for the rest of the year, job growth is going to be quite subdued,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"Whether it's as subdued as 2025 ... is still an open question. But I would not expect job growth to be higher than 50,000 for the remainder of 2026.\"Indeed, revisions the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday put job gains last year at just 15,000 a month. The last six months of the year produced a net loss of 1,000 jobs. In the recent words of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, the year's job growth was close to \"Zero. Zip. Nada.\"Also, nearly all the January jobs came from health care-related sectors, raising questions over the ability of displaced and new workers to be able to get hired. On top of the anemic gains, Daco has another worry. He sees trouble brewing with the receding income gains for cash-strapped consumers possibly causing damage not readily visible in headline economic numbers.Average hourly earnings advanced 0.4% in January, slightly higher than expected, but the annual gain of 3.71% was the lowest since July 2024. With retail sales unexpectedly flat in December, and consumer spending responsible for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, that could spell a potential danger sign.\"We're heading from a jobless expansion to potentially an income-less expansion, because income is essentially the combination of jobs and wages. With both under pressure, that means that for many families, income and income growth prospects are muted,\" Daco said.Questions for the futureSo while the monthly numbers are good, whether they are an outlier, or even if they will stand up, remains to be seen. After all, every month in 2025 saw a negative revision from the initial estimate. The release comes with other economic signs looking strong. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of growth, is on pace to post a solid 3.7% gain in the fourth quarter after posting 4.4% and 3.8% increases in the prior two periods in 2025, according to the Atlanta Fed.However, that kind of growth is hard to sustain without stronger job gains, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock.\"One key warning sign is that in past cycles, GDP growth like this has usually required far more hiring. The fact that hiring has slowed while growth has advanced may potentially be an early signal of a productivity boom that we expect to continue,\" Rieder said in a note. \"While areas like healthcare are still labor intensive, the more interest-sensitive parts of the economy are clearly still under pressure, particularly the lower income segment.\"The state of the labor market and its relation to inflation sets up a policy challenge at the Federal Reserve, which already has seen significant divisions over how to proceed.Most recently, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland said Tuesday that they don't see a need to cut rates further with inflation still above the Fed's target and the labor market stable. As voters this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, their positions conflict with those of Governor Waller, who is advocating for more cuts, a position also held by Fed Chair-designate Kevin Warsh.\"I think there is room for the Fed to get a little bit closer to median estimates of neutral policy,\" EY's Daco said. \"I don't necessarily think that that will be the case ... in part because a majority of Fed policy makers are more focused on the inflation mandate than on the employment mandate.\"For their part, markets took the view Wednesday that the January payrolls report will temper any urges to cut rates soon. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker, trades are pricing in the likelihood of a cut in March at roughly 6%, though they still see two reductions before the end of the year.",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it \"a new housing crisis.\"Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.91 million, according to the NAR. Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022.This count is based on closings, so contracts that were likely signed in November and December, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage didn't move much before dropping slightly in January. That rate is now 6.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Regionally, sales fell across the nation month to month but were down the most in the South and West. \"Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR's Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022,\" Yun said in a release. \"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.\"But he also noted on a call with reporters that potential buyers are \"still struggling,\" and \"renters are not participating in housing wealth.\" He characterized the current market as a crisis because, \"the movement is not happening. Americans are stuck.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.Tighter supply kept home prices in positive territory. The median price for a home sold in January was $396,800, up 0.9% year over year and the highest January price on record. \"Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth,\" Yun added.Homes are taking longer to sell, at 46 days in January versus 41 in January 2025. About 31% of sales were to first-time buyers, up from 28% a year ago. Sales continue to be strongest on the higher end of the market; in fact, the only price segment in the positive from a year ago was the $1 million-plus range. Sales dropped the most for homes priced below $250,000.",

    "body": "watch nowRestaurant Brands International on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped expectations, fueled by strong international growth.However, shares of the company fell 6% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expectedRevenue: $2.47 billion vs. $2.41 billion expectedRestaurant Brands reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $113 million, or 34 cents per share, down from $259 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction costs, restructuring expenses and other items, the company reported adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share.Net sales rose 7.4% to $2.47 billion. Stripping out currency fluctuations and sales from restaurants it plans to refranchise, Restaurant Brands' organic revenue ticked up 6.5%.The company's same-store sales increased 3.1%, fueled by strong international growth. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands' same-store sales climbed 6.1%. International Burger King restaurants, which represents the bulk of the segment, saw same-store sales growth of 5.8%. Analysts were projecting international same-store sales growth of just 3.7%, based on StreetAccount estimates.And Restaurant Brands plans to keep growing its business abroad. In November, the company announced its plan to form a joint venture for Burger King China to accelerate expansion. Under the terms of the deal, which closed in late January, CPE, a Chinese alternative asset manager, owns roughly 83% of Burger King China. Restaurant Brands has retained a minority stake of about 17%, along with a seat on the board of directors.Restaurant resultsCanadian coffee chain Tim Hortons reported same-store sales growth of 2.9%, although Wall Street was projecting an increase of 3.8%, according to StreetAccount. Tim Hortons accounted for 46% of Restaurant Brands' overall revenue during the quarter.Burger King reported overall same-store sales growth of 2.7%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 2.4%. The burger chain has leaned into promotions, like the SpongeBob SquarePants menu that launched in December, to fuel traffic growth from families. \"We didn't need to rely on deep discounting to drive top-line results,\" Restaurant Brands Executive Chairman Patrick Doyle said on the company's conference call.The chain offers $5 duo and $7 trio combo meals to reach budget-conscious diners, but it has kept its value offerings consistent, helping Burger King save on marketing dollars, Restaurant Brands CEO Josh Kobza told CNBC.  Burger King has also dealt with higher costs, particularly from rising beef prices. Executives said beef costs climbed 20% in 2025, putting pressure on profits for the chain and its franchisees.Popeyes was the laggard of Restaurant Brands' portfolio. Its same-store sales fell 4.8%, a steeper decline than the 2.4% decrease forecast by Wall Street. But the company has plans to revive the embattled fried chicken chain. To bring back customers, Popeyes needs to focus on its operations and core menu items, like its famous chicken sandwich, Kobza said.In November, Restaurant Brands tapped Burger King veteran Peter Perdue to lead the chain's U.S. and Canadian business; last month, the company also named Popeyes veteran Matt Rubin as the chain's latest chief marketing officer.\"We've been very upfront that sales are not where they should be, and you saw us make leadership changes in 2025 and earlier this year,\" Doyle said. \"As a result, I'm confident that the steps we're taking, particularly the renewed focus on operations, consistency and brand standards, will translate into better performance over time.\"Restaurant Brands plans to share more of its ideas to grow the business at its investor day in Miami on Feb. 26.",

President Donald Trump first levied the duties in April 2025 with an across-the-board rate on all goods and services entering the U.S. along with a menu of so-called reciprocal tariffs on individual countries. Since then, the White House has been negotiating with its trading partners, backing off on some of the more aggressive charges while maintaining tough talk on issues.Last November, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments challenging the auspices under which Trump justified the tariffs. The decision was expected in January. The high court hasn't ruled yet, and there's concern in the White House that a negative ruling could force the U.S. into reimbursing the duties collected so far.The tariffs helped put a dent in the pace of the budget deficit.In the fourth month of the fiscal year, the shortfall totaled roughly $95 billion, down about 26% from the same period a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Year to date, that put federal red ink at $697 billion, or down 17% from the same period of fiscal 2025, according to numbers not adjusted for calendar. Calendar adjustments put the deficit reduction at 21%. Interest on the $38.6 trillion U.S. debt continues to be a burden on the national finances. Net interest paid totaled $76 billion for the month, more than all other expenditures except Medicare, Social Security and health care.

Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state Attorney General Keith Ellison, for cooperating with the federal efforts despite their political differences.Around the same time Homan was speaking, Ellison sharply criticized the federal actions in Minnesota.\"The surge is contributing to violent crime,\" he said in testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\"Two of the three homicides committed in Minneapolis in 2026 have come at the hands of federal immigration agents,\" the attorney general testified.Homan in Thursday's presser said, \"There were some issues here,\" but insisted that they have been addressed.\"We've had great success with this operation, and we're leaving Minnesota safer,\" he said.",

    "body": "Cranes unload shipping containers from a ship at the Port of Long Beach Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Allen J. Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA record-breaking number of companies shipping products into the United States are coming up short on a federal government requirement to financially guarantee they can cover the import trade duties triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. And this is leading to a record amount of money paid to the U.S. to cover the shortfalls.U.S. Customs data shared with CNBC shows that what are called customs bond \"insufficiencies\" reached a total of 27,479 in fiscal 2025, with the combined value soaring to almost $3.6 billion. It is the highest number of bond insufficiencies and the highest total value across insufficiencies ever recorded. In fact, it doubles the 2019 level when tariffs enacted by President Trump under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also fueled bond shortfalls. \"Bonds are the primary tool used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to safeguard the revenue of the United States and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations,\" said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.Under U.S. Customs' guidelines, the agency continuously reviews bond adequacy, and a bond is flagged as being insufficient when an importer's duty/tax liability exceeds 100% of their current bond capacity. The record shortfall comes at a time of record tariff revenue for the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.\"In totality, it makes sense that insufficiencies are more than double,\" said Jennifer Diaz, attorney at Diaz Trade Law. \"Many companies take it for granted that a $50,000 bond should be able to cover you for a one-year period,\" she said. \"But it might not. They are not utilizing set calculations, and don't have anyone in their corner telling them that their bond obligation is higher.\"International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million.Importers buy customs bonds, also known as surety bonds, through specialized insurance companies known as surety companies. The bonds are issued approximately 30 days before imports arrive in the U.S. to ensure that Customs collects the requisite tariffs in the event an importer does not pay its obligation. The bonds are held for 314 days by Customs in accounts that bear no interest. During this time, duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive final government sign-off.U.S. importers pay a premium to insure their bonds. The premium is typically 1% of the bond limit, with the price of the bonds covering 10% of the duties and taxes paid over a rolling 12-month period. If tariffs and taxes go up, the customs bond requirement goes up as well.Surety companies have told CNBC they have seen bond increases upwards of 200%. \"In one unusual case, a large auto manufacturing client saw its custom bond amount increase by 550%,\" Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC.If the bond is insufficient, the importer can't get the freight, and it is held by Customs until the bond meets requirements. To address the shortfall, importers need to have another bond issued and that can take at least 10 days.In addition to the bonds, companies rely on related collateral to guarantee trade duty coverage. \"If companies do not increase their collateral, the goods will be stopped at the port,\" Moy said. The collateral is held by the insurance company that issues the bond for the 314-day period dictated by U.S. Customs. Companies have told CNBC that the tariff-triggered bond insufficiencies have created additional strain on their relationships with customs brokers.The Supreme Court could soon rule on President Trump's IEEPA tariffs, deciding if they are legal. Feb. 20 is the next date for a potential decision and U.S. importers may be in line for not only trade tax refunds but also the money laid out for customs bonds and related collateral. If tariffs are refunded, the bond amounts associated with those imports can be used to reduce to levels sufficient to cover the duties, taxes, and fees. Companies will need to petition the insurer that issued the bond for a reduction of the bond and collateral. Trade experts tell CNBC importers should be ready if this happens.Surety companies tell CNBC importers should expect some lag time in receiving these funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi takes her seat before testifying before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Justice, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 11, 2026.Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesAttorney General Pam Bondi at a House Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday seemed to have a printout of Rep. Pramila Jayapal's history of searches of the Department of Justice's database of documents related to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Photos of a black binder that Bondi had at the hearing showed the words \"Jayapal Pramila Search History\" and a list of documents whose numbers coincide with the numbering of Epstein files.Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, and other members of Congress have visited the DOJ in recent days to view documents related to Epstein that are not available to the public. Jayapal blasted Bondi in a post on X on Wednesday evening.\"It is totally inappropriate and against the separations of powers for the DOJ to surveil us as we search the Epstein files,\" Jayapal wrote.\"Bondi showed up today with a burn book that held a printed search history of exactly what emails I searched,\" the congresswoman said.\"That is outrageous and I intend to pursue this and stop this spying on members.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., when asked by MS Now if Bondi's alleged action was appropriate, at first said, \"I'm not going to comment on an allegation that is unsubstantiated. I don't know anything about it.\"\"I haven't seen or heard anything about that, but that would be inappropriate if it happened,\" Johnson said.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi holds a piece of paper labelled \"Jayapal Pramila Search History\", in reference to U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, during the committee's hearing on oversight of the Justice Department, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 11, 2026. Kent Nishimura | ReutersJayapal earlier during Wednesday's hearing had a contentious exchange with Bondi after asking survivors of Epstein's abuse — who were in the room — to stand and indicate if they had been unable to meet with the DOJ.Multiple women stood and raised their hands. \"I'm not gonna get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" Bondi said when Jayapal asked her to apologize to the victims for the DOJ's failure to fully redact their names when the files were released to the public.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens.

So they could essentially surveil members to see what we were going to ask her about?\" Jayapal said to the news outlet.The DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC when asked if Bondi had a printout of the congresswoman's search history, why she might have had it, or if the DOJ kept track of searches by other members of Congress.",

    "body": "The Anthropic AI logo is displayed on a mobile phone with a visual digital background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAnthropic, the artificial intelligence lab that's taken heat from the White House for its support of regulations and safety, is putting $20 million into the political arena ahead of the 2026 elections.The company said on Thursday that it's donating to Public First Action, a group that's challenging the AI industry by supporting candidates across the political aisle. The group has just launched six-figure ad buys to back pro-AI regulation candidates Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Pete Ricketts from Nebraska, both Republicans.Blackburn, a U.S. senator now running for governor of her state, has led kids online safety bills, while Ricketts, who's running for re-election, introduced legislation this year to limit advanced U.S. chips from being sold to China. Public First Action is headed by former lawmakers Brad Carson and Chris Stewart. Carson told CNBC in an interview that the group aims to support about 30 to 50 candidates this cycle, and plans to raise between $50 million to $75 million. That's far less than the $125 million raised so far by pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, whose donors include tech investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, venture capitalists Joe Lonsdale, angel investor Ron Conway and AI software startup Perplexity.Carson said public opinion is on his side. A Gallup survey published in September found 80% of respondents wanted rules for AI safety and data security, even if that means slowing development of the technology. \"Leading the future is driven by three billionaires who are close to Donald Trump\" with a \"particular view of how AI regulation should go and want to kind of buy it off,\" Carson said. \"We believe it should be more democratically accountable.\"In a blog post, Anthropic said policy is needed to \"keep the risks in check\" as well as \"maintaining meaningful safeguards, promoting job growth, protecting children, and demanding real transparency from the companies building the most powerful AI models.\"David Sacks, President Trump's AI and crypto czar, criticized Anthropic in October, after Jack Clark, one of the startup's co-founders and its current head of policy, published an essay called \"Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,\" which sparked a debate over AI regulation online.Sacks posted on X that Anthropic was \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" He said the company is \"principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.\"Two months later, President Trump signed an executive order issuing a single regulation framework for AI, undermining the power of individual states, namely Democratic-led states like California and New York. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that the group launched ad buys to back Pete Ricketts from Nebraska. A previous version misspelled his last name.

    "body": "watch nowFamilies won't see relief from rising electricity prices anytime soon, as demand from artificial intelligence data centers soars while power supply grows slowly, according to Goldman Sachs.Electricity prices jumped 6.9% in 2025 year over year, more than double the headline inflation rate of 2.9%, Goldman analysts told clients in a research note published Wednesday. Prices will continue to rise through the end of the decade, as data centers make up 40% of electricity demand growth, the analysts said. This will lower disposable income, drag down consumer spending and slightly slow economic growth in the coming years, they said. Households will see electricity prices rise an additional 6% through 2027, the analysts said. Price inflation will then slow to 3% in 2028 on lower natural gas prices, they said. Consumer spending growth will fall 0.2% through 2027 and economic growth will slow 0.1% as a result, according to Goldman.The trajectory of electricity prices, however, will vary widely across the U.S. based on different regional market structures and what regulatory choices are made, the bank said. \"The income and spending drags will likely be larger for lower-income households because electricity accounts for a greater share of their spending,\" Goldman analyst Manuel Abecasis said. Households in regions with more data centers will also take a bigger hit, he said. Higher electricity prices will increase core inflation by 0.1% through 2027 and by 0.05% in 2028 as businesses pass on higher costs to consumers, the Goldman analysts said. watch nowThe rapid growth of data centers is colliding with a constrained electricity supply as regulatory barriers as well as labor and material shortages make it difficult to build new power plants, the analysts said. The tight supply-demand balance will push up wholesale electricity prices, particularly in California, the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, they said. Utilities will spend more on infrastructure to meet the demand and that will also be passed on to consumers, they said. The role that the AI industry is playing in electricity price inflation has turned into a major political flashpoint ahead of the midterm elections this November. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won elections for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, in 2025 in part on promising to bring utility bills under control. President Donald Trump has embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth, but he  increasingly sees electricity prices as a threat to the Republican Party's political fortunes. Trump secured a promise from Microsoft in January that it will not allow its data centers to drive up prices.The White House also signed a pact with several states last month that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants in the nation's largest electric grid, PJM Interconnection. Data centers are playing a particularly disruptive role in the PJM market, which covers 13 states, primarily across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The cost to secure power supplies in PJM has exploded in recent years, with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. These costs get passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.",

    "body": "McDonald's on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations as its value push wins back customers.\"By listening to customers and taking action, we have improved traffic and strengthened our value & affordability scores,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.12 adjusted vs. $3.05 expectedRevenue: $7 billion vs. $6.84 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.16 billion, or $3.03 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald's earned $3.12 per share.Net revenue climbed 10% to $7 billion.The company's same-store sales increased 5.7%, fueled by strong growth in its home market. Wall Street was projecting same-store sales growth of 3.9%, according to StreetAccount estimates.U.S. same-store sales increased 6.8%. In the year-ago period, its domestic same-store sales shrank 1.4% after an E. coli outbreak weeks into the quarter weighed on traffic. McDonald's credited buzzy promotions — like its Grinch Meal and Monopoly promotion — that boosted both traffic and sales this year. For nearly a week, McDonald's was the largest seller of socks in the world, thanks to the popularity of the Grinch Meal, which included the special-edition clothing item in many of its markets. Kempczinski said the company sold 50 million pairs globally in the first few days of the promotion. It was also the catalyst for McDonald's highest-ever sales day, according to Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. The chain also expanded its value offerings by relaunching Extra Value Meals, which offer a roughly 15% discount on combo meals.Outside the U.S., McDonald's saw same-store sales growth in nearly all markets. The company's international operated markets segment, which includes Germany and Australia, reported same-store sales growth of 5.2%. Its international developmental licensed markets division saw same-store sales rise 4.5%.Looking to 2026, McDonald's is \"off to a strong start,\" according to Borden. But executives expect weaker first-quarter same-store sales growth compared with the fourth quarter. While Extra Value Meals are drawing in diners, the winter storm that swept across the country in late January scared some away and caused temporary restaurant closures.For the full year, McDonald's is planning to spend between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion on capital expenditures, according to a regulatory filing. Most of that will be spent opening approximately 2,600 new locations. The addition of 2,100 net new restaurants is expected to raise systemwide sales about 2.5%, excluding currency fluctuations. McDonald's plans to open about 750 restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets, while licensees and affiliates will open more than 1,800 restaurants in other markets.\"We believe the underlying assumptions for our 2026 outlook are prudent and reflect our expectations that the [quick-service restaurant] industry environments in the U.S. and across many markets will remain challenging,\" Borden said. The chain also has big plans for its menu in 2026. Later this year, McDonald's will roll out new beverages, including energy drinks, fruity refreshers and crafted sodas in the U.S. and select international markets. The new drinks are the result of lessons learned from its now-shuttered CosMc's spinoff and a 500-restaurant test that took place last summer. Like Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, McDonald's is hoping that fun drinks will attract diners and lift sales.The chain has also been leaning into chicken, which is more popular with U.S. consumers than beef. Recently, several Chicago-area locations began testing hand-breaded chicken strips, wings and grilled sandwiches. Still, the experiment is still in the early stages, Global Chief Restaurant Experience Officer Jill McDonald said on the company's conference call.Longer term, McDonald's is also looking to add menu items that would interest diners who are using GLP-1 drugs, McDonald said. Plus, the chain will highlight the high protein content of its existing menu.\"We'll be led by the customers and what they what they want from us, but there's plenty [for] them to enjoy on our menu currently,\" she said.",

He did not say which employees may have been cut as a result of the restructuring or which employees may have resigned of their own volition.\"We are hiring aggressively,\" Musk added. Earlier this week, xAI co-founders Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu announced their exits after several other founding members, including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy and Greg Yang, previously departed.Last week, Musk announced a record-setting, all-stock transaction in which SpaceX, the aerospace and defense juggernaut, acquired xAI, which owns and operates social network X and is the developer of Grok, the embattled AI chatbot and image generator. The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post merger, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The co-founder departures and the reorganization this week come as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year and while xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S.The probes are looking into whether xAI violated regional regulations after Grok enabled mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time. WATCH: Calculating Elon Musk's wealth: Here's what to knowwatch now",

    "body": "A vehicle fills up with fuel at a gas station in Havana on January 28, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to fuel-starved Cuba, dismissing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threat to sanction countries that send oil to the Caribbean island.\"We wouldn't want any escalation, but on the other hand, we don't have much trade right now,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.His comments came in response to a question about whether the Kremlin was concerned about the Trump administration's tariff threats.The White House has pledged to impose tariffs on countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly, saying the communist-run government represents an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The U.S. has stepped up its pressure campaign on Cuba's leadership since Jan. 3, when it conducted an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.Peskov reportedly said Thursday that Moscow would seek to engage in \"constructive dialogue\" with the U.S. over Cuba's deepening energy crisis.\"It's clear that it's impossible to discuss these issues in such a public manner right now for obvious reasons,\" Peskov said. Read moreCuba, which has been the subject of a U.S. trade embargo for more than 60 years, is mired in a worsening economic crisis.As such, Cuba's government recently outlined emergency measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors. The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. Cuba's leadership warned on Sunday that international airlines would no longer be able to refuel in the country due to an ongoing aviation fuel shortage.Air Canada subsequently canceled all flights to the island, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country back home over the coming days.

    "body": "Dutch payments giant Adyen's stock fell as much as 20% after it posted net revenue guidance and payment processing volume that were slightly weaker than expected.The company forecast net revenue growth of 20% to 22% for 2026, while analysts expected year-on-year growth at 22.8%, according to LSEG estimates.\"This outlook is underpinned by a strong pipeline and the continued ramp of our 2025 cohort, providing a solid foundation for the year ahead,\" Adyen said in its shareholder letter. \"We expect market volume growth to remain broadly in line with 2025 levels, reflecting continued macroeconomic uncertainty.\"Adyen processed 745.3 billion euros ($885.5 billion) in payments in the second half of the year, which came in below a 771-billion-euro revenue estimate from KBC Securities.\"Although results today and next year's outlook is largely ok, this might not be enough to turn around the very negative sentiment on the payment sector we have seen recently,\" KBC Securities said in a note on Thursday morning.The stock was down 16% as of 11.15 a.m. local time, and shares are down around 16% so far this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAdyen stock in the year-to-dateAdyen reported net revenue had increased 17% YoY on a reported basis, hitting 1.27 billion euros, with both EMEA and North America growing 17% each.Net revenue gains were \"moderated by slower growth\" from APAC-headquartered online retailers and a weaker U.S. dollar, the company said.Net revenue from APAC clients accelerated slightly to 14% growth, which Adyen reported was mostly driven by deepened relationships with existing customers.Net revenues for the second half were largely inline with analyst forecasts. Adyen has seen some big stock swings in recent years. Its share price fell 39% in August 2023, after reporting worse-than-expected sales and a profit drop in the first half of the year. ",

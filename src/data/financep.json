    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during a welcoming ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025.Bandar Algaloud/courtesy Of Saud | Via ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, with the leaders expected to discuss the deepening of defense, trade and technology ties as well as coperation in the fields of artificial intelligence, security and nuclear energy.The trip follows Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May in which the kingdom made a $600 billion trade and investment commitment to the U.S. Analysts say Trump will be looking to cement those pledges this week.\"The United States wants Saudi Arabia to purchase more of its goods and services and increase investments in U.S. companies, and Saudi Arabia is seeking greater access to U.S. tech and innovation to support its ambitious Vision 2030 reforms,\" Tim Callen, visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said ahead of the meeting.The U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum scheduled on Nov. 19 will be an opportunity to seal more economic deals between the two countries, Callen said, noting that Saudi Arabia wants a two-way street with Washington when it comes to investments.\"There is little doubt that Saudi investments and purchases of U.S. products will increase. However, it may be that U.S. investments into Saudi Arabia see the strongest growth in the coming years given the improved investment climate in the kingdom,\" Callen said, with \"opportunities provided by Vision 2030, and availability of reliable low-cost energy and abundant land to support the expansion of AI and related activities of U.S. tech companies.\"Image rehabilitiationThe visit to the U.S. will be the first undertaken by Saudi Arabia's defacto ruler since 2018, when Saudi agents killed a journalist and high-profile critic of the Saudi regime, Jamal Khashoggi, in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he's widely known, denied ordering the killing but a U.S. intelligence report concluded the crown prince had approved the operation.Protests in Washington over the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 10, 2018.Umar Farooq | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesSince the widespread scandal around the killing, and criticism of Saudi's record when it comes to gender equality and human rights generally, the kingdom has looked to rehabilitate its global image. It has done this predominantly through looking to broker peace agreements in the Middle East, and a push to host blockbuster sports events, such as the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer.Having seen its regional nemesis Iran largely weakened as a result of U.S. and Israeli joint strikes on the republic, Saudi Arabia has seen its own dominance grow and has positioned itself as a key strategic ally to the U.S. in the region.",

    "body": "A Panera Bread sign hangs on the exterior of the restaurant on July 25, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWhen Panera Bread began shrinking its sandwiches and skimping on salads, it started shedding customers.Now, to win them back, the chain plans to reinvest in the business and undo many of those same cost-cutting measures, it said Tuesday.Once the number one fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has dipped to number three, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. Last year, its sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. For years, the chain's traffic has been shrinking, according to CEO Paul Carbone, who took the reins earlier this year. Controversy after the chain's foray into energy drinks didn't help matters, either.Panera's troubles have coincided with a tough year for fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Cava have all cut their full-year forecasts as they see younger consumers eating out less frequently.Carbone has a plan to bring back customers. Under the strategy, named \"Panera RISE,\" the company aims to refresh its menu, focus on value, improve its service and build new restaurants. He said the plan has the backing of the franchisees who operate roughly half of its 2,200 U.S. locations, along with the support of JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that owns the company.Panera's slide has been poorly timed for JAB. The firm has been plotting an IPO for the chain's parent company Panera Brands, which also owns Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels.In 2021, four years after taking the chain private, JAB struck a deal with Danny Meyer's special purpose acquisition company for a merger that would take the company public again. But Panera scrapped those plans a year later, citing market conditions. In late 2023, the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that still hasn't happened.When asked about the status of Panera's IPO plans, Carbone told CNBC that the chain's management team is currently focused on growing traffic and implementing the Panera RISE strategy.Entering the value warsPhase one of Panera's plan is to improve the quality of its food, reversing cost-cutting measures imposed in the face of high inflation, according to Carbone.\"We squeezed food costs. We squeezed labor,\" he said.Some of those changes happened while Carbone was chief financial officer. He now calls himself a \"reformed CFO\" — albeit one who still listens to earnings conference calls.\"It's really about death by a thousand paper cuts, it truly is,\" Carbone said about the chain's downturn.Take Panera's salads, for example. In the summer of 2024, Panera began using a mix of half romaine, half iceberg lettuce to make its salads, saving the chain money compared to when it was using romaine alone. This summer, the it reverted back to entirely romaine salads.\"You know what guests told us? No one likes iceberg, and no one gets that and says, 'Oh my God, that white salad, it looks so appetizing,'\" Carbone said.And then there's the cherry tomato. Carbone said Panera is one of the few restaurant chains that doesn't slice the bite-sized tomatoes in half, a decision made to save on labor costs.\"We make the guest chase the cherry tomato around the bowl,\" he said.And when a salad comes with an avocado, customers have to cut the halved fruit themselves, rather than it coming pre-sliced. The chain will start slicing the cherry tomatoes and avocados early next year.Plus, Panera's salads typically have five ingredients, while those of competitors like Sweetgreen feature as many as eight.But it wasn't just salads that were affected by the cost-cutting measures.\"In some instances, we shrunk portions, so guests would walk into our cafe to buy a sandwich that has gone up significantly in price, with lower quality ingredients, in a smaller size,\" Carbone said.The menu refresh will also include new items. Last month, the chain announced that it is testing new \"fresca\" and \"energy refresher\" drinks.Panera previously offered highly caffeinated energy drinks, but it discontinued the line, which included Charged Lemonade, following two wrongful death lawsuits and related negative publicity. Panera denied wrongdoing and settled the lawsuits earlier this year.When it comes to value, Panera is planning on leaning into a barbell menu strategy, offering customers options on both the low- and high-price end. The approach has worked particularly well for casual-dining chains like Chili's, but Panera doesn't have the same appetizer offerings as a full-service restaurant.\"We haven't cracked the code yet,\" Carbone said. \"We're doing a lot of testing.\"Chains across the restaurant industry have embraced value offerings, from McDonald's Extra Value Meal to Applebee's \"2 for $25\" deal, igniting the so-called \"value wars.\" However, restaurants have to balance the desire to attract cash-strapped diners with maintaining their profit margins.To improve the customer experience, Panera is planning to invest more into labor. Like many restaurants, Panera in recent years scheduled fewer workers and relied more on the self-order kiosks it pioneered in the industry. That approach saved money, but customers often walked into a cafe and couldn't find an employee in sight, according to Carbone.Panera will also invest back into its kiosks, which it hasn't significantly upgraded since they first entered its restaurants roughly a decade ago. And its dining rooms will get a facelift, too.If these changes succeed in bringing back lapsed customers, then Panera's restaurants will become more profitable, fueling future restaurant growth. And those new bakery-cafes could look different.\"What does the cafe of the future look like? We're doing a lot of work around that, we're going to test different things,\" Carbone said.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, reacts during the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, October 31, 2025.Kim Soo-hyeon | ReutersArm on Monday said that central processing units based on its technology will be able to integrate with AI chips using Nvidia's NVLink Fusion technology.The move will make it easier for customers of both companies who prefer a custom approach to their infrastructure — namely hyperscalers —to pair Arm-based Neoverse CPUs with Nvidia's dominant graphics processing units.It's the latest example of Nvidia using dealmaking to partner with nearly every major technology company as it finds itself at the center of the AI industry. The announcement signals that Nvidia is opening up its NVLink platform to integrate with a wide variety of custom chips, instead of forcing customers to use its CPUs.Nvidia currently sells an AI product called Grace Blackwell that pairs multiple GPUs with an Nvidia-branded Arm-based CPU. Other configurations include servers that use CPus from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices.But Microsoft, Amazon and Google are all developing or deploying Arm-based CPUs in their clouds to give them more control over the set ups and reduce their costs.Arm doesn't make CPUs but it licenses its instruction set technology that those chips need. The company also sells designs that allow partners to more quickly build Arm-based chips.As part of Monday's announcement, Arm said that custom Neoverse chips will include a new protocol that'll allow them to move data seamlessly with GPUs.The CPU has historically been the most important part in a server. But generative AI infrastructure is based around the AI accelerator chip, which in most cases is an Nvidia GPU. As many as eight GPUs can be paird with a CPU in an AI server.In September, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion into Intel, the leading CPU maker. A key part of the deal was to enable Intel CPUs to integrate into AI servers using Nvidia's NVLink technology.Nvidia reached an agreement to buy Arm for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal failed in 2022 because of regulatory issues in the U.S. and U.K. Nvidia had a small stake in Arm, which is majority-owned by Softbank, as of February.Meanwhile, Softbank liquidated its entire stake in Nvidia earlier this month and Softbank is backing the OpenAI Stargate project, which plans to use Arm technology in addition to chips from Nvidia and AMD.WATCH: Nvidia's options pricing can swing 6-7% in either direction, says Susquehanna's Murphywatch now",

    "body": "German Rheinmetall MAN tactical military transport vehicles parked in the Edvard Peperko military barracks.Luka Dakskobler | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesShares of Germany's Rheinmetall rose on Tuesday after the defense giant told investors to expect sales to quintuple over the next five years, boosted by robust demand for its weapons systems amid geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine.The company forecast sales of about 50 billion euros ($58 billion) by 2030, up from about 10 billion euros in 2024. The bulk of 2030 sales will come from its vehicle systems and weapons and ammunitions businesses, Rheinmetall said. It sees operating margin expanding to about 20%, up from 15.2% in 2024.Shares rose 3% to 1,775 euros by midday Tuesday, topping the German blue-chip DAX index which was almost entirely in the red.Rheinmetall, like many other defense contractors, has benefitted from Europe's increased defense spending against the backdrop of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Earlier this year NATO allies agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product by 2035, up from a previous target of 2%, citing \"profound security threats and challenges,\" including the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security.Rheinmetall's revenue has already nearly doubled over the past three years and shares have risen about 190% so far this year, and about 900% over the last three years.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRheimetall shares have risen about 190% so far this year\"Despite the stock's meteoric rise, forward multiples suggest that the market does not fully appreciate Rheinmetall's growth,\" Rothschild & Co Redburn analysts said earlier this month.Early Tuesday, Rheinmetall also announced a reorganization of its units, including creating new naval and air defense units, expected to bring in a combined 8-9 billion euros in sales by 2030. CEO Armin Papperger said he hoped the new naval unit would be ready in January.M&A could be another growth driver for the German \"wunderstock,\" however, it will depend on the availability of suitable targets, the Rothschild analysts said.In September, the company announced a deal to acquire Lürssen Group for an undisclosed purchase price, with the transaction expected to close early 2026.",

All companies saw shares dip as much as 6%.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that computer makers are in the midst of an unprecedented pricing \"supercycle,\" as hyperscalers continue to accelerate data center demand, pushing hardware valuations to reach all-time highs.Rising costs in the DRAM, dynamic random access memory, and NAND memory, a flash memory typically used in memory cards, businesses could put pressure on margins, especially as memory fulfillment rates may fall as low as 40% over the next two quarters, according to the bank.\"This as an emerging, and potentially significant, risk to CY26 earnings estimates for our Global Hardware OEM/ODM universe, where memory accounts for 10-70% of a products' bill of materials,\" analysts wrote.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Major DRAM and NAND manufacturers have been hiking prices as climbing AI infrastructure demand continues to bleed memory supplies dry.

    "body": "The Home Depot logo is displayed on a sign outside of a store on Sept. 6, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Tuesday cut its full-year profit forecast and missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter as it saw weaker home improvement demand, tepid consumer spending and lower than usual storm activity.The retailer said it now expects full-year sales will climb about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive. That compares to its previous expectations for full-year sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to increase by 1%.The revised outlook includes an estimated $2 billion in incremental revenue from GMS, a building-products distributor that Home Depot acquired earlier this year. The company's sales were not part of its previous full-year guidance.Home Depot expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline by about 5% from the year-ago period, compared to its prior expectations that they would fall by about 2%In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said the retailer previously expected home improvement activity would increase. It also anticipated higher sales of roofing materials, generators and other supplies that typically sell before and after seasonal storms.Neither dynamic materialized, he said, putting pressure on the business. \"When we set guidance, we had anticipated that demand would begin to accelerate gradually in the back half of the year as interest rates and mortgage rates eased,\" he said. \"But what we saw was that ongoing consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.\"Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.74 adjusted vs. $3.84 expectedRevenue: $41.35 billion vs. $41.11 billion expectedHome Depot's stock dropped more than 3% in premarket trading Tuesday. As of Monday's close, the company's shares are down about 8% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 13% gains during the same period.For Home Depot, housing turnover typically sparks larger and more lucrative projects as customers fix up their homes before or after moving. Those big projects, however, have dropped in frequency as higher interest rates have led to steeper mortgage rates and borrowing costs for loans, which a homeowner may use to pay for a kitchen remodel or major addition.Since roughly the middle of 2023, McPhail has told CNBC that homeowners have been in a \"deferral mindset.\" That's led to a bit of a waiting game for Home Depot, as it awaits either lower mortgage rates or a shift by consumers who get used to higher mortgage rates as the new normal.In the most recent three-month period, that waiting game continued. McPhail told CNBC that demand was \"stable\" from the fiscal second quarter to the third quarter when adjusting for the lack of hurricanes. But, he added, \"at this point, it's hard to identify near-term catalysts that would lead to acceleration.\" Home Depot's net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 dropped to $3.60 billion, or $3.62 per share, from $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue decreased from $40.22 billion in the year-ago quarter.Average ticket, the typical amount spent by customers at the store or on the company's website, rose 1.8% year over year in the quarter. However, customer transactions fell 1.6% year over year.A bright spot in the quarter was online sales, which rose by 11% year over year, McPhail said.Compared to other big-box retailers, Home Depot's customers tend to be more financially stable. About 90% of its do-it-yourself customers own their homes and the home professionals who shop at the retailer tend to get hired by homeowners.Even so, McPhail said Home Depot's weaker outlook came in part because shoppers across income groups are reluctant to take on high-dollar projects. He said a slower housing market and the higher cost of borrowing has contributed to the trend.He said other factors may also be having a chilling effect, including the prolonged government shutdown, an uptick in corporate layoff announcements and a decline in home values in some markets.As do-it-yourself customers postpone bigger projects, the company has tried to attract more business from contractors, roofers and other professionals.The company has made two key purchases of pro-related companies. Last year, it bought Texas-based SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion — the largest acquisition in its history. The company sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses. Earlier this year, Home Depot announced it was buying GMS.Like other retailers, Home Depot has felt the pinch of higher costs on some imported items because of tariffs. McPhail said in May that the company was diversifying the countries where it sourced its goods and intended to \"generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio.\"However, company leaders warned in August that it may have to hike prices in some categories because of higher tariffs.McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has increased some items' prices, but said \"where there were price actions, they were modest.\" He said Home Depot has kept prices the same for some key items or even been able to reduce them. For example, he said, its best-selling seven-and-a-half foot Grand Duchess Christmas tree and many of its strings of lights for trees have dropped in price. ",

    "body": "Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) questions witnesses during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC on Sept. 17, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSen. Bill Cassidy on Monday proposed replacing enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits with pre-paid health savings accounts.The Louisiana Republican's proposal comes as lawmakers scramble to find a remedy for skyrocketing costs of Obamacare health insurance premiums.The boosted ACA tax credits, which this year have lowered the cost of Obamacare plans for about 20 million Americans, are set to expire at the end of December.Cassidy's proposal would allow people who signed up for a so-called Bronze Plan through Obamacare marketplaces to get a pre-paid HSA, funded in part by the lapsed tax credits.While HSAs would not help pay for monthly premiums, Cassidy told reporters that they would help reduce the cost of health-care expenses, such as co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance.Bronze plans  generally cover 60% of an enrollee's health costs, with the enrollee responsible for paying the remaining 40% out of pocket.\"Is there anybody who would not want to take a large portion of that, which we're using to help Americans purchase health care, and give it directly to the individual, so that 100% of its used to purchase health care, as opposed to, as opposed to giving that money to the insurance company, of which 20% goes for profit and overhead?\" asked Cassidy, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.The federal government shut down on Oct. 1, and remained shut down for weeks when Senate Democrats refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill because it did not include an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.Last week, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with them, agreed to end the 43-day-long shutdown by voting for a funding bill. Their agreement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, D-.S.C.,  promised to hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the tax credits.But even a temporary extension of the ACA credits faces a near-impossible obstacle course to being passed into law, in part because it would require Republican support. GOP members of Congress have long tried to gut the Affordable Care Act, which became law under President Barack Obama with only Democratic votes.Cassidy said he is talking with other senators, as well as the Trump administration, about how his HSA plan would work.With roughly a month to go before a planned vote, lawmakers have little time to finalize their plans before presenting them.Yet Cassidy's plan is already meeting with some resistance from some Democrats and health-care policy experts.Larry Levitt, an expert with the KFF health policy research group, on Sunday responded to an interview Cassidy did with CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\"Giving ACA enrollees cash in flexible spending accounts would help with out-of-pocket health costs like deductibles,\" Levitt tweeted.\"But, they wouldn't do someone much good if they can't afford health insurance to begin with and end up getting sick.\"On Monday, Levitt tweeted, \"Without the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, people would have a harder time buying plans with affordable deductibles.\"\"But, I do not believe this plan from @SenBillCassidy would cause a premium death spiral in the same way as other health account proposals that've been floated,\" he wrote.Death spirals occur when healthy people exit a health-care insurance plan, leading to ever-rising premiums for less healthy people who remain in the plan.",

    "body": "Mug shot of Eric Gillespie, Govini Founder and Chairman.Courtesy: Pennsylvania Attorney GeneralGovini founder Eric Gillespie urged a person who he believed to be a dad offering his 10-year-old daughter to be sexually abused to use encrypted chat platforms, a Pennsylvania criminal complaint alleges.\"Signal is safer for er small talk,\" Gillespie wrote to the purported father, who was actually an undercover law-enforcement agent, according to a transcript of a chat included in the criminal complaint obtained by CNBC.Gillespie then wrote that Session, another commonly used end-to-end encrypted platform, is \"fine but less secure\" than Signal, the filing says.While chatting in Session, he sent the agent multiple photos of a \"recent playmate\" wearing a diaper and made repeated graphic references to sex acts with children, court documents state.Gillespie also wrote that he preferred young children: \"best when they can't talk.\"The charging documents note that users can delete media and messages sent in Session, and because of that, the agent could not get screenshots of media files sent by Gillespie.The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General said that the chat with the agent began in an online forum often used by people attempting to arrange meetings with children.The men then moved their discussion to Session, according to the AG's office, which last week said it had arrested and charged Gillespie with four felony counts, including unlawful sexual contact with a minor.He is being held without bond.His arrest came at a pivotal time for Govini, a defense contractor that is a key player in the U.S. military's push to modernize.Gillespie's lawyer, David Shrager of Shrager Defense Attorneys, told CNBC that he \"vigorously denies these charges.\"\"In this case, two adults were lying to each other in an internet fantasy chat, where at least one of the participants was using AI,\" Shrager said.The criminal complaint notes that at one point in the conversation, the agent sent \"A photo media file of an undercover female Agent age regressed with AI technology to appear approximately 10 years of age.\"That is the only mention of the use of artificial intelligence in the complaint.\"It's easy to understand why people rush to judgment when they hear about these types of charges,\" Shrager told CNBC.The attorney said that he believes Gillespie will be exonerated.Gillespie is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing on Thursday before Magisterial District Judge John Ditzler in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.Govini last week called Gillespie a \"depraved individual\" in a statement announcing his termination as executive chairman of the company's board of directors.Govini said that Gillespie \"has no role with the company and is not a majority shareholder.\"\"Since being terminated, he will not receive a paycheck,\" the company said.The company did not disclose the current level of Gillespie's stake in Govini.Earlier this year, Govini landed a nearly $1 billion contract with the Department of Defense and joined the U.S. Army's Next Generation Command Control program.In October, Govini announced a $150 million investment from Bain Capital.Bain declined to comment on Gillespie's arrest.Gillespie was quoted prominently in a news release about Bain's investment.\"I founded Govini to create an entirely new category of software built to transform how the U.S. government uses AI and data to make decisions,\" Gillespie said at the time. \"After methodically developing our proprietary technology, that vision is now a reality.\"Accel and Salesforce Ventures are also major investors in Govini. Neither company has responded to requests for comment.Multiple people familiar with Govini, and who had personal contact with Gillespie, said that he had an active role at the company. Documents and text messages reviewed by CNBC support that claim.One person, who asked not to be named in order to discuss internal communication, described Gillespie as the point man for key financial dealings.In a statement responding to questions about his day-to-day involvement at the company, Govini said, \"Mr. Gillespie had opinions and ideas and did not hesitate to share them.\"\"In his capacity as Executive Chairman, he was aware of and consulted on the operations of the leadership team,\" the company said.Pentagon officials last week said that they are looking into Gillespie's arrest and possible security issues.CNBC asked the department if it is looking at possible actions related to the company's status as a government contractor.\"While the Department cannot comment on individual security clearances in accordance with the Privacy Act, we take these allegations very seriously,\" a senior Pentagon official said in a statement.",

    "body": "Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast released Monday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad, who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group, today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.Gundlach said he is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making \"garbage loans\" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.\"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" he said. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\"Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a \"perfect mismatch\" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.",

    "body": "Larry SummersCameron Costa | CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Monday that he was stepping back from all public commitments amid fallout from the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC.\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" said Summers, a former president of Harvard University who teaches at the school.Summers is a member of the board of OpenAI. He is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.CNBC has requested comment from OpenAI.Summer's statement came after Harvard's newspaper, the Crimson, published an article detailing his emails with Epstein, which came to light last week when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate.U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Crimson noted that when Summers was \"pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, he sought guidance from a longtime associate: convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.\"Emails and texts between the two men from November 2018 and July 2019, showed Summers, who was and is married, turning \"to Epstein for advice on his pursuit of the woman,\" the paper reported.That time frame was a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to solicitation of prostitution from an underage girl.In the emails and texts, \"Epstein was quick to chime in with assurance and suggestions, describing himself in one November 2018 message as Summers' 'wing man.' \" the Crimson noted.\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote that same month. \"I think I'm right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.\"\"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former professor at Harvard Law, told CNN that Harvard should sever its ties to Summers. Summer is the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and this semester is teaching five courses at Harvard, the Crimson noted.Warren said Summers \"cannot be trusted\" with students, given his past relationship with Epstein.\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren told CNN. \"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\"On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting on a request from President Donald Trump, said she had asked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and the bank JPMorgan Chase.Trump himself is a former friend of Epstein. The president has been criticized for months for the Department of Justice's refusal to release investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.The House of Representatives on Tuesday is set to vote on a measure that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files.",

    "body": "Epstein Survivors Launch National PSA Calling for Release of Remaining FilesSource: WorldWithoutExploitation.orgA group of victims of Jeffrey Epstein in a new ad calls for Congress to pass a measure to force the Department of Justice to release investigative files about the notorious sex offender, following months of resistance to that by the Trump administration.\"Five administrations and we're still in the dark,\" the public service announcement says at the end, after the victims hold up photos showing themselves as girls and young women, when Epstein began abusing them.\"Call your Congress member and demand they release all the Epstein files,\" the PSA produced by the group World Without Exploitation says.The ad comes in advance of a House of Representatives vote on the measure. NBC News reported Monday that House GOP leaders intend to put the Epstein resolution on the floor for a vote on Tuesday.On Sunday night, in a major reversal, President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to vote in favor of the measure. Trump last week pressured congressional Republicans not to support a petition that forced the vote.But he now seems to acknowledge the likelihood of the Republican-controlled House, and potentially the Senate, voting in favor of the measure.Trump and the DOJ for months have resisted demands that they release the Epstein files after Attorney General Pam Bondi reneged on promises to make those documents public.\"I was 17 when I met Jeffrey Epstein,\" said Danielle Bensky, one of the women in the ad, said in a statement.\"I was an aspiring ballerina working odd jobs to support my mother, who was battling a brain tumor, and to keep up with my training,\" Bensky said.\"A woman told me about a wealthy philanthropist who might help. What began as a chance to pay for dance lessons turned into months of abuse,\" she said. \"Epstein used my mother's illness to control me. He promised help and threatened to take it away if I spoke. It took me years to tell the truth, and I tell it now because too many people still believe this story should stay hidden.\"A billboard in Times Square, paid for by the group Home of the Brave, highlights Jeffrey Epstein's comment that Donald Trump \"of course he knew about the girls.\", on November 17, 2025 in New York City. Adam Gray | Getty ImagesAnother victim, Annie Farmer, in a statement said, \"When I was 16, I trusted adults who told me they wanted to help me succeed. That trust was taken advantage of in a way that shaped the rest of my life.\"Farmer also said, \"The people who shielded Epstein have had decades of protection. Survivors have had decades of unanswered questions. Sharing the remaining documents helps correct that imbalance.\"Trump, in a Truth Social post on Sunday, said, \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files.\"\"Because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown,'\" Trump wrote.Despite Trump's comment about Democrats, the measure has been pushed by Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican. Massie has said that 100 or more Republicans in the House might end up voting for it.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

The email did not say what Epstein meant by that. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019.In December 2018, in response to an unidentified person who had mentioned Trump being targeted for a \"take down,\" Epstein replied, \"its wild. because I am in the one able to take him down.\"watch nowYears earlier, in April 2011, Epstein wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison term for procuring girls to be sexually abused by him.\"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump,\" Epstein wrote, without elaborating on what that meant.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein wrote in the same email, after saying that a woman who has been identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.The Epstein emails were obtained from his estate through a subpoena issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's serial sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends.

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe standard Medicare Part B premium will increase to $202.90 per month in 2026, up $17.90, or 9.7%, from $185 per month in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The increase marks the second-highest Part B premium increase in dollars, according to Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022.Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said.A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases. That said, other automatic deductions from Social Security checks for premiums tied to private Medicare Advantage insurance plans or Part D prescription drug coverage may reduce benefits, according to Johnson.The $202.90 standard Part B premium rate will apply to individuals with modified adjusted gross income less than or equal to $109,000, and for married couples who file taxes jointly with modified AGI less than or equal to $218,000.Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries pay what is called an income-related monthly adjustment amount that is added to their monthly premiums if their incomes are higher, according to CMS.The annual deductible for Part B will be $283 in 2026, according to the agency, a 10% increase from the $257 annual deductible in effect for 2025.The increases to both Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles are primarily due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the CMS fact sheet on the price changes.Income-related adjustment amounts are typically based on tax returns filed two years prior. Beneficiaries who have since had their income go down, or who have experienced a qualifying life event, may report that by submitting a form to the Social Security Administration.",

    "body": "Christopher Waller, governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks during the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Monday voiced support for another interest rate cut at the central bank's December meeting, saying he's grown concerned over the labor market and the sharp slowdown in hiring.In an increasingly divided Fed, Waller's comments put him squarely in the camp of those looking to ease monetary policy to head off further danger in the jobs picture. Others, including multiple regional presidents, have expressed opposition in recent days to more cuts as they view inflation as a persistent economic threat that could be reignited by additional easing.\"I am not worried about inflation accelerating or inflation expectations rising significantly,\" Waller said in prepared remarks delivered to a group of economists in London. \"My focus is on the labor market, and after months of weakening, it is unlikely that the September jobs report later this week or any other data in the next few weeks would change my view that another cut is in order.\"The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee next meets Dec. 9-10. Markets are divided over which way the panel will swing following consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, cuts at meetings in September and October.Earlier Monday, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson was noncommittal on the upcoming meeting, saying only that the current economic climate calls for policymakers to \"proceed slowly\" as it contemplates further cuts. Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Wednesday that she sees a \"high bar\" for more easing.Waller specified that he favors another quarter-point move. Governor Stephen Miran, who like Waller is an appointee of President Donald Trump, favored half-point moves at the prior two meetings.While he has spoken out multiple times in recent months in favor cuts, Waller updated his comments to reflect recent developments. Absent government data during the recently ended shutdown, the policymaker cited a variety of other data points showing weak demand in the labor market and pressure on consumers.At the same time, he said price data has indicated that tariffs will not have a long-lasting impact on inflation. Cutting rates again will be an exercise in \"risk management,\" a term Chair Jerome Powell also has been using.\"I worry that restrictive monetary policy is weighing on the economy, especially about how it is affecting lower-and middle-income consumers,\" Waller said. \"A December cut will provide additional insurance against an acceleration in the weakening of the labor market and move policy toward a more neutral setting.\"Waller rejected claims that the Fed has been \"flying blind\" on policy as the shutdown suspended almost all official government economic data.\"Despite the government shutdown, we have a wealth of private and some public-sector data that provide an imperfect but perfectly actionable picture of the U.S. economy,\" he said.",

    "body": "Oleksii Liskonih | Istock | Getty ImagesJapan's fragile economy, already hurt by U.S. tariffs and declining investments in property, faces another hit due to the diplomatic spat between Tokyo and Beijing.Miffed over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments related to Taiwan, China on Friday advised its citizens against travelling to the country. Japanese tourism-exposed stocks fell in the aftermath of that warning, while experts caution the impact could be more severe over a longer duration.Mainland Chinese tourists have been the largest group of foreign visitors to Japan so far in 2025 at about 5.7 million, or nearly 23% of all visitors, according to Japan's National Tourism Organisation.Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, said tensions between the two Asian powers could result in a 1.79 trillion yen drop in Japan's GDP over the course of one year — a 0.29% decline in the country's GDP.Mainland Chinese tourists to Japan dropped nearly 8% in 2013 compared to 2012 when there was a dispute over islands off western Japan in September 2012, known as the Senkaku in Tokyo and Diaoyu in Beijing. Kiuchi sees a similar risk in how the current situation is unfolding.Travel spending is a huge growth driver for the world's fourth largest economy, with inbound tourism contributing 0.4 percentage point to Japan's 0.1% annual GDP growth last year, according to the Mastercard Economics Institute.Stefan Angrick, head of Japan at Moody's Analytics, echoed Kiuchi, saying that \"a sharp drop in Chinese travel to Japan would sting.\" Angrick said that if Chinese arrivals were to halve — as they have during previous diplomatic spats — Japan's GDP growth could shrink by 0.2 percentage point.\"[This is] Hardly catastrophic, but an unwelcome drag for an economy already struggling to find traction,\" Angrick said.Japan's third quarter GDP contracted 0.4% sequentially, marking its first contraction in six quarters. On an annualized basis, the economy shrunk 1.8%.Rising tensionsThe current diplomatic spat started on Nov. 8, when Takaichi said that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force would constitute a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Japan, adding that if U.S. warships intervened to break a Chinese blockade, Japan could be required to defend its ally.China's consul general in Osaka Xue Jian retaliated on X, reportedly saying \"the dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\" in a post that was later deleted. Tokyo summoned China's ambassador to protest the \"extremely inappropriate\" remark, followed by Beijing summoning Japan's envoy, issuing travel warnings, and deploying ships and drones near the Senkaku islands, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets.watch nowChinese state-run editorials also took aim at Japan, with state broadcaster CCTV saying last week that Takaichi's remarks were of an \"extremely egregious nature and impact\" and was a \"gross interference in China's internal affairs.\"Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of its own territory, and has not ruled out the use of force against the island. Taiwan rejects this claim and says that only it's people can decide its future.Experts also told CNBC that the tensions could last for several months.David Roche, veteran investor and president of Quantum Strategy, said this will last until Takaichi backs down from her position that there could be a potential Japanese military intervention over Taiwan.\"This is a big red line for China,\" he said, adding, \"this is seen by Beijing as a significant interference and a clear indication that Japan will be part of efforts to surround and deter China.\"Roche said that even the U.S. maintains a stance of \"strategic ambiguity\" when it comes to the defense of Taiwan.The U.S.' 1979 Taiwan Relations Act states that it \"would consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means\" a matter of grave concern to the United States, but does not commit the U.S. to Taiwan's defense, creating this \"strategic ambiguity.\"watch nowTobias Harris, founder and principal at political risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, told CNBC that this dispute could last longer than expected, as neither side can easily back down from their position.Taiwan's importance to Beijing means that it cannot easily accept what looks like a policy change by Takaichi, and though the Japanese leader has insisted that her statement did not signify a change in stance, she cannot easily back down, and risks looking weak if she caves to Chinese pressure, Harris said.\"With her approval ratings still strong, she can still afford to resist, and may in the near term benefit from resisting,\" He said. Takaichi's approval ratings currently stand at 69% as of Nov. 16, among the highest in Japanese history, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.This diplomatic spat could be the beginning of a \"THAAD-like episode\" in the countries' bilateral relationship, causing \"a prolonged chill in political and economic relations and a reduction in people-to-people exchanges.\"The \"THAAD-like episode\" refers to China reportedly organizing boycotts of South Korean products, banning group tours to South Korea and imposing a \"soft ban\" on K-pop content after South Korea deployed the U.S.′ Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system, also known as THAAD, on its soil in 2016.",

    "body": "A broadcast screen at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in Mumbai, India, on April 3, 2025, displays news of U.S. President Donald Trump announcing sweeping new trade tariffs. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's goods trade deficit hit an all-time high of $41.7 billion in October as gold imports surged on festive season demand, while exports to U.S. bore the brunt of steep tariffs.The deficit, which was sharply wider than Reuters poll estimates of $28.8 billion, topped the previous all-time high of $37.8 billion in November 2024, according to LSEG data.During October, India imported gold worth of $14.7 billion, up nearly 200% from a year earlier, data from the country's commerce ministry released Monday showed. Indian consumers are estimated to have bought gold worth $11 billion during the 5-day festival period in October.The impact of tariffs was also visible in trade data as India's exports to the U.S. fell for a second consecutive month since the 50% tariffs came into effect in August end. Shipments to U.S. fell 8.5% year on year in October to $6.3 billion.Despite the decline, the U.S remained India's largest exports destination during the first 7 months of this fiscal year, accounting for shipments worth $52 billion.India exported gems and jewelry worth $2.3 billion in October down 29.5%, engineering goods worth $9.4 billion, down 16.7%. Exports of cotton and man-made yarn and ready-made garments fell 12%-13%. The U.S. is the top export destination for all these commodities.Meanwhile, India's exports to China rose 42% to $1.6 billion.The country's merchandise imports are \"expected to cool somewhat in November-December 2025 from the October levels\" due to a sequential dip in gold imports as the festive season ends and some pickup in exports, Moody's-owned Indian credit rating firm ICRA Research said in a note on Monday.But it cautioned that India's current account deficit is set to \"widen materially to 2.4-2.5% of GDP\" in the third quarter of fiscal year ending March 2026. It expects the ratio of CAD to gross domestic product to be around 1.2% in fiscal year 2026, if the 50% U.S. tariffs continue until end-March 2026.Trade negotiations between U.S and India have been underway for months, but a deal has been elusive so far. Both sides have begun to soften their stance, with U.S. President Donald Trump hinting at reducing tariffs on India.Reaching out to Washington, New Delhi has increased oil and gas purchases from the U.S. to reduce the trade surplus it enjoys with Washington. The country is also expected to purchase farm products from the U.S.",

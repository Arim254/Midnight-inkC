    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

Photo: Yolande CheeYolande CheeIndia hosted one of the world's biggest AI events this week, but it was marred by chaos and confusion, apparently not the message it's trying to send as it strives to become a leading artificial intelligence player.Despite the drama, U.S. tech firms in particular couldn't resist the temptation of the Indian market, talking up the country's AI potential and making a number of announcements.I have been on the ground in New Delhi since Monday and I can honestly say that the AI Impact Summit has been one of the most challenging reporting assignments of my career.Traffic has been a nightmare more than usual in the Indian capital. There were times it didn't move at all. On Wednesday, I had events and interviews at three different hotels and getting the team around to these appointments on time was a real challenge.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalAt one point on Thursday, were weren't even sure if we'd be able to enter the Bharat Mandapam, the venue where the summit took place. That's because instructions were not clear on when media would be allowed in on Thursday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event.We eventually found out we could enter at 6 a.m. local time. When we turned up, security did not let us in until later, not before a crowd of media had gathered at the gates. Inside, security were giving out conflicting instructions. Several delegates expressed to me their frustrations over the organization of the summit. The event itself was marred by other controversies. Bill Gates, who was named in the Epstein files, was scheduled to give a keynote address. There was then uncertainty if he would even turn up. The Gates Foundation had said earlier in the week that he would give the speech, but then on Thursday said the billionaire had pulled out.Meanwhile, a university was reportedly kicked out of the summit for suggesting a robot dog they were showcasing was its own creation. A professor at Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot, which was actually made by Chinese firm Unitree, was \"developed\" by the academic institution.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalOnline users called out the university, highlighting that the robot was made by a Chinese firm. The university denied claiming it had built the robot.\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavor to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real-world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is [the] need of the hour,\" the university said, according to media reports.Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw apologized on Tuesday for the \"problems\" on day one.

Modi had delegates on stage with everyone holding hands. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't do as they they'd been instructed, in a moment that instantly got scrutinized across social media. Altman later explained that he was \"confused\" and wasn't sure what he should be doing.Days earlier, Anthropic ran a Super Bowl ad taking digs at OpenAI's decision to test advertisements in ChatGPT. India's lureDespite all of these moments, the event pulled in a who's who of tech names from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to Altman, all of whom talked up India's advantages from a huge talent pool to a large consumer market. \"The excitement here, it's just been incredible to watch,\" Altman told me. These tech firms used the week to make announcements and form partnerships around India. OpenAI said it would be the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services' data center business. Google announced partnerships with researchers and education institutions for its Gemini artificial intelligence feature.Read moreEvery CEO I spoke to praised India's tech development and focus. The government used the opportunity to tout India's potential as an AI hub saying the country was aiming to attract $200 billion in AI investment over the next two years.Even the blaring horns of the cars of New Delhi and the chaos of the Summit weren't enough to dampen the enthusiasm from big tech for India which continues to grow as a critical and attractive market for some of the world's largest firms.",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. airlines began canceling Sunday flights and waiving cancellation and change fees for airports from Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26. Southwest Airlines said customers are eligible for a change without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook to fly or fly standby within two weeks.The storm could bring between 13 and 18 inches of snow to parts of southern Connecticut and southeast New York, as well as winds of up to 55 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. The blizzard warning is set to begin at 6 a.m. ET Sunday.As of 4:30 pm ET Saturday, close to 400 U.S. flights were canceled, according to FlightAware. Delta had the most, with 174 cancellations or 5% of its mainline schedule. New York airports, which make up a major Delta hub, were the most affected by Sunday's disruptions.The National Weather Service raised its initial assessment of the potential severity of a storm. The weather service now says 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow is possible in many areas. Blizzard warnings were also issued for New York City, Long Island, southern Connecticut and coastal communities in New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.The weather service warned that the storm's steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would \"make travel dangerous, if not impossible.\"Winter Storm Fern in January, followed by bitter cold, caused mass travel disruptions across a large swath of the U.S.Read more CNBC airline newsUnited Airlines is overhauling its MileagePlus loyalty program to favor credit cardholdersSpirit Airlines sells more planes, calls back 500 flight attendants from furlough ahead of spring breakFAA abruptly halted El Paso flights over Defense Department’s plans for anti-drone technologyPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsSouthwest ends open seating after 54 years.

    "body": "Julia Holden can relate to the struggle of getting your baby to fall asleep.In February 2024, she and her husband noticed that their newborn son Maxime fell asleep more quickly when his eyes were gently covered with a burp cloth or small towel, she says. As a new mom \"in survival mode,\" Holden quickly looked for a purchasable product — a comfortable eye covering that'd stay on his tiny face if he moved — but couldn't find one she liked, she says.As a younger adult, Holden had dreamed of entrepreneurship, so her near-instant thought was to make this product herself and sell it, she says. She designed a baby hat with an attached eye covering, named her side hustle Sleepy Hat and, over the course of the next year, spent nearly $16,000 from her personal savings to bootstrap the business, she says.Since June 2025, the business has brought in five figures in revenue each month, including over $90,000 in December and more than $69,000 in January, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The company is profitable, says Holden, who initially launched it while working full-time as a senior relationship manager for an advertising company and taking care of her baby.She found time for Sleepy Hat in 20-minute windows between breast-feedings at her home in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, she says. \"I had no outside funding, no team and no child care beyond family help,\" says Holden, 34.DON'T MISS: How to read people and master your body language to be more influential at workHolden quit her job — which paid her $95,000 a year, she says — in October to focus on Sleepy Hat full-time. Most of its profits have been reinvested back into the business, including payroll for two-part-time contractors who help with inventory and running ads on Google and Amazon, she says. \"I also recently took on an advisor, [who has] a little bit of equity,\" Holden says.Holden paid herself $2,500 from the business in 2025, and has been living off her remaining personal savings and her husband's income as an assistant director at Princeton University. She works anywhere from 30 to 60 hours per week, including weekends, she says. Doing all of that while being a mom to a now-2-year-old is taxing, but since she sets her own schedule, she can at least take more time during daylight hours for herself and her family than she did at a 9-to-5, she says.\"I'm still stressed, but for a more meaningful reason,\" says Holden. \"It feels more important. It's much more satisfying.\"'My first sale from a stranger was life-changing'Holden didn't have \"proof of market fit\" when she decided to launch Sleepy Hat, she says. Rather, she brought the idea to other moms in her circle, who she says all called it \"genius.\"She intended to spend about $10,000 launching the business, and surpassed her budget on \"product development, creating patterns, creating prototypes and samples ... and then all the tiny little things that add up, like purchasing a domain, a trademark [and] building a website,\" she says.She didn't have a design background, so the first pattern she and her mom created together resulted in a hat that was \"completely the wrong size,\" she says. An entrepreneur friend referred her to a factory in China, which sent her prototypes. But her \"tech pack\" — a garment blueprint for manufacturers, essentially — initially wasn't detailed enough, resulting in about $1,500 worth of defective products, she says.Before creating the \"Sleepy Hat,\" Holden would use a cloth to limit visual distractions during nap time for her son, Maxime.Julia HoldenAfter finalizing the product's design and ordering 1,500 units, Holden \"splurged\" on a photographer to fill a website for Sleepy Hat with professional-looking images, she says. The website launched in September 2024, and didn't receive many sales until around December, when Holden posted her product and website on online marketplace Grommet, she says.Sleepy Hat ended the year with just under $2,000 in total sales. \"My first sale from a stranger was life-changing,\" says Holden. \"I was so excited but also terrified to actually ship the product.\"Holden joined Amazon as a third-party seller in August 2025. Roughly around then, her posts on Sleepy Hat's TikTok account started gaining traction, with some garnering hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of likes. Moms bonded in the comments over their \"FOMO babies\" who fought sleep while on walks, car rides or in restaurants, saying they \"needed\" the hat for their kids.The road to 'six-figures plus'Most of Holden's sales now come from paid online advertising, she says. She's designing Sleepy Hats with new patterns and materials, improving her social media strategy and updating her packaging, she adds.\"The goal is to increase my own salary on a quarterly basis this year,\" says Holden. \"I hope to double what I pay myself in Q2 in April ... I hope next year to be able to pay myself actually more than what I was making at my full-time job, so six-figures plus.\"Holden isn't technically a first-time entrepreneur — she previously started a short-lived T-shirt brand and website for women runners — but she's still working on her financial acumen and organizational skills, she says. She's worked with an accountant, alongside her advisor, to help her cover that weakness, she says.The original Sleepy Hat sketch Holden came up with in 2024.Julia Holden\"You need to understand every dollar that's coming out and every dollar that's coming in,\" she says. \"And I'm not particularly finite. I just don't gravitate towards spreadsheets ... So it's definitely been a learning curve to force myself to take the time and understand the balance sheet and where every dollar is going, and it's still a work in progress.\"Holden has also learned the value of trusting her gut, she says. She recalls a moment when her sister, who owns a PowerPoint tutorial business, advised against launching a startup as a new mom.\"She was like, 'I would not start a business right now. You're [freshly] postpartum,'\" Holden says. \"And I was like, 'OK, I hear you. I'm going to do it anyway.'\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

US CENTCOM | Anadolu | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement after the decision. \"We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.\"The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsFor Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.\"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. \"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\" Moreno continued.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.\"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,\"  Paul posted on X. \"This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.\"The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would require approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision \"a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court.\"\"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,\" Bacon wrote on X. \"In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.\"Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.\"Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. \"I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.\"In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.\"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,\" Horsford posted to X.The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the Supreme Court decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be \"effective immediately.\" He also warned that additional levies would follow.  \"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been \"ripping\" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,\" he wrote.\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs,\" he added.Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing.

On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling \"ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American\" in a social media post.

    "body": "World leaders during the G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, June 17, 2025.Amber Bracken |ReutersU.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies.The law that undergirds the import duties \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited Supreme Court decision.Hours after the ruling, Trump said he signed an executive order imposing a new 10% \"global tariff\". The \"Section 122\" tariffs will take effect \"almost immediately,\" Trump said. At a White House press briefing Friday afternoon, Trump railed against the \"deeply disappointing\" 6-3 ruling.Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiations.Taiwan, home to the the world's leading contract chipmaker and producer of the most advanced semiconductors, said the 10% flat tariff rate would, according to an initial assessment, have a \"limited impact\" on its economy.The island will continue to \"closely monitor\" developments and maintain close communication with the U.S. to understand the specific measures and respond in a timely manner, the Taiwanese cabinet said in a statement on Saturday.French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said the Supreme Court's ruling proved the benefit of having an effective counterweight to power.\"It is not bad to have a Supreme Court and, therefore, the rule of law,\" Reuters quoted him as saying at an event in Paris on Saturday.A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world\"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,\" the spokesperson said.\"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue.\" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminum, cars and pharmaceuticals.The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.watch nowWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move \"does little to clear the murky waters\" for British businesses, warning that the President still has \"other options at his disposal\" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminum tariffs.  \"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,\" Bain said in a statement. \"For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.\"Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on \"stability and predictability.\" \"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,\" Gill said. \"We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.\"Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"No trade 'win' yetElsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to \"legitimize tariffs,\" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.\"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,\" Swissmem said.\"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,\" Swissmem wrote on X. \"The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.\"The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the \"significant strain\" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.\"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,\" the ICC said.— CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.",

The artificial intelligence company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said. In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals, partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. Nvidia is in discussions to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and Amazon. OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said. The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October. OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.The company's coding product, Codex, has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanwatch now",

    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. importers will be facing many hurdles trying to recover billions in tariff costs now that the Supreme Court has ruled President Donald Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, tariffs are illegal.Companies large and small may be eligible for refund payments that in total could reach hundreds of billions of dollars, but trade attorneys have warned that tariff refunds could be denied or delayed, depending on how U.S. courts rule and how the legal system and U.S. Customs and Border Protection go about issuing any eligible payments.Record tariff revenue has been recorded by the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.The Supreme Court decision could mean as much as $175 billion sought in refunds, according to estimates, but the ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump announces 10% global tariff after raging over Supreme Court lossTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsIn his dissent from the majority Supreme Court decision on Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote: \"the Court's decision is not likely to greatly restrict Presidential tariff authority going forward. But the Court's decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term. One issue will be refunds. Refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the U. S. Treasury. The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"Trump wrote in a social media post back on Jan. 12 that \"it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay.\" He added, \"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay.\"At a White House press conference on Friday afternoon, Trump raged against the Supreme Court decision and said of paying the refunds, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years. ... We'll end up being in court for the next five years.\" Trump also said he would sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, \"over and above our normal tariffs already being charged. And we're also initiating several section 301, and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies,\" Trump added, referring to another section of the 1974 act.Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers, says her initial view of the Supreme Court decision is that it does not grant or guarantee refunds. \"They have remanded this back down to the lower courts to decide if refunds will be issued. Without knowing for certain, many believe that the refunds will not be issued retroactively,\" she said. For importers hoping for refunds, \"the answer is yes, we have a ruling but we do not have a ruling on if any refunds will be granted. That will be handled by a lower court at a future date/time,\" she said.\"Keep in mind also that several countries have also already signed written agreements with specific tariff rates such as the signed agreement with the UK for a flat 15% tariff. This does not impact those already signed agreements so we are not sure, right now, how those country specific agreements will be impacted if at all,\" Mullins added.In the lead-up to the decision, importers and customs experts have been pushing back on claims about refunds being a \"messy\" process, saying that because the tariffs being paid are itemized, the process for refunding the money should be straightforward.The Court of International Trade is typically in charge of refund processes. Trade attorneys do expect the case to be sent back to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which would presumably then remand the case to the CIT to decide on how to handle refunds.Timothy Keeler, partner and co-head of international trade practice at Mayer Brown and former chief of staff for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, believes refunds will ultimately be due to companies. \"There will be refunds,\" he said. \"It's just not clear what the process will be to get refunds. It's not clear if companies will have to file in court and become a plaintiff to get refunds, or whether it'll end up being an administrative process,\" handled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he said.For starters, the Court of International Trade and litigants who file cases against the tariffs, in coordination with the U.S. government, would need some time to figure out how to manage any refund process. The Department of Justice and the litigants in the tariff cases previously asked the CIT to appoint a steering committee to manage the more than 1,000 refund-related cases filed to date. It's common for a steering committee to be established to manage the tariff repaying process.Even if courts ultimately rule refunds are required, importers betting on a cash infusion from tariff refunds should be aware there's no set timeline and any rush for refunds could overwhelm the system and likely lead to long delays. Joyce Adetutu, international trade lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, said her firm is telling clients it is going to be difficult to issue a broad-scale refund with the \"push of a button.\"\"I don't think that is going to be the scenario here,\" Adetutu said. \"I think what's more likely is that the CIT and the government, Customs, are going to work together to try to allow those who have preserved their claim for a refund to seek that refund ... and those who don't protest will forfeit any refund,\" she added.\"We believe it may take months, if not years, to be decided by the CIT,\" said Greg Tompsett, vice president of customs brokerage USA at logistics company Kuehne + Nagel. \"The extended period of time may also result in additional subsequent lawsuits, which may drive that back to the Supreme Court. So the good news is we do have some finality on the decision. The bad news is there is no immediate action to be taken by any importer to request refunds or to go back after that money,\" he said.Companies will not only be seeking billions in tariff refunds, but billions that are tied up in customs bonds and collateral. Tariffs not only lead to additional import taxes, but by inflating the cost of the products, result in the need for importers to increase the value of customs bonds the government requires them to hold. International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million. The increase in bond values have left some companies forced to put up additional money in the form of collateral to ensure they could pay the tariffs. The rise in tariffs and related need for bonds and collateral has led to a historic number of \"bond insufficiencies.\" CBP told CNBC it identified more than 24,000 customs bond \"insufficiencies\" valued at nearly $3.6 billion. That's double the 2019 level when insufficiencies first soared due to Trump's first-term tariffs under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act.Importers have told CNBC because tariffs are itemized, as are their customs bonds and collateral documentation, in theory they should be able to receive their refunds quickly. However, trade attorneys also say it may be difficult for companies to get any refunds on bond overpayment or collateral quickly because the insurers will want to make sure they are not exposed to any tariff payments.Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC that companies should expect some lag time in receiving these customs bond funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.Some sureties have collateral return review procedures that can take 30 to 60 days for them to go back to underwriting to review. Many small and medium-sized businesses were expected to be reaching out to their insurers ahead of the Supreme Court decision to get the process of review started. \"If you are hoping that the collateral will just be returned in due course, the squeaky wheel may make this happen a little bit faster,\" Jennifer Diaz, board-certified international attorney at Diaz Trade Law, recently told CNBC.Democrats on Capitol Hill weren't waiting to press for action from the administration after the court loss. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent asking for details on administration plans to refund businesses that paid the illegal tariffs.\"Many American businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, have struggled to pay these illegal tariffs and, for some, the financial strain has placed them on the brink of bankruptcy,\" wrote Cantwell. \"It is essential Treasury implement an expeditious and transparent process to remediate the financial harm that resulted from these illegal tariffs.\"",

She daydreamed about her childhood sharing a landline with her family.Cat Goetze is the founder of Physical Phones, a Bluetooth-enabled landline style phone.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"When I grew up, there was this booklet that the school sent out to all of the families in the school district that literally had all of the students' names and their home phone numbers,\" Goetze says. \"I distinctly remember prank calling some of the other people in the school using that phone book.\"But when she looked into what it would take to actually install a landline in her home, including getting a new phone number and paying the $80 monthly service she was quoted, she set out to find a different way.As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally.Cat Goetzefounder of Physical Phones\"With my technical background, I thought to myself, it probably wouldn't be that difficult to just hook up a landline phone to my smartphone,\" says Goetze, who pursued an interdisciplinary major in science, technology and society at Stanford. \"Then I started tinkering around and prototyping and figuring out a way to build that.\"In 2023, Goetze built a prototype of her first phone, a pink handset, and posted it to TikTok. At the time, she didn't have much of a social media audience, and the post got no traction or sales.\"I was like, OK , whatever, that's fine. This was like a fun project,\" she says. \"I wasn't really trying to make money off of it anyways.\"Two years later, in 2025, she'd gained a following for her online brand, CatGPT, where she discusses AI and digital wellness. She was also noticing more people talking about wanting to reduce their smartphone dependence. It reminded her of her landline phone prototype, so she posted about it again.That video from July 2025 went viral, getting over 8 million views across Instagram and TikTok. The product, officially branded Physical Phones, passed $120,000 in sales in its first three days.\"As a creator, your job is really to kind of hold an antenna out into the zeitgeist and pick up on what people want creatively, spiritually, emotionally,\" she says. When she revisited the idea at just the right moment, \"it took off.\"Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItDialing up the businessPhysical Phones are battery-powered and connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth.Once connected, the landline acts just like your cellphone. If your phone rings, the landline will too, and you can carry out your call from the handset. To make an outbound call, you can use the landline set to directly dial the number.For most of us who no longer memorize phone numbers, you can also pick up the handset and dial star (*) to activate the voice assistant on your phone, like Siri, where you can direct it to dial a certain contact.The Physical Phone also works with audio calls from FaceTime and Whatsapp.Pre-orders for Physical Phones opened in July 2025 and fully funded the first round of production, covering things like warehousing, shipping, printing, hiring and \"everything else that we needed to actually get the business off the ground,\" Goetze says. Physical Phones currently sells three styles of phones — a handset, a wall mount and a rotary version — that range in price from $90 to $110.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItThe business sources phones from a manufacturer in Asia, meaning it also lost a \"whopping portion\" of profits due to tariffs under the Trump administration's new policy, Goetze says.Goetze says working with a manufacturer was the hardest part of the process of launching Physical Phones because she'd never done it before and, as she learned, it can be time-intensive.\"It's pretty draining, honestly, because what I underestimated before building Physical Phones was just how every single detail gets pored over for a hardware product,\" she says. It took two to three months to finalize the first Physical Phone, she adds.Goetze says her goal with the first round of orders was to deliver them to customers by December 2025 in time for Christmas.Shipping everything by cargo boat would have taken too long, Goetze says. The only way for them to meet their goal was to fly all the phones from the manufacturer in Asia to their warehouse in California by cargo plane.The endeavor cost the company nearly $74,000, which covered the international freight charge; customs entry fee; and delivery, service and administrative expenses.\"It was a huge hit to our profit margin,\" Goetze says. \"But I also think that it's those kinds of decisions where you really stand up for your customer and you show them how much you care.\"Cat Goetze posted a call for pre-orders of Physical Phones in July 2025. The business passed $120,000 in sales within three days.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make ItOnce they got all the phones to their warehouse, Goetze says she and her team \"called in every single friend, family member, colleague, neighbor that I knew and basically asked anybody with a pair of hands to come to the warehouse and help us break down and ship all of these phones within 24 hours.\"Goetze says she and her team prepared 4,000 orders for delivery across the U.S. in December 2025.Ringing off the hookPhysical Phones currently sells three styles of phones, including a handset, wall mount and rotary phone, which range in price from $90 to $110. To date, Goetze says the business has sold over 7,500 devices.Physical Phones made about $439,000 in profit in 2025, which Goetze says she reinvests back into the business for research and development for new models, and to hire for her small team of four.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItGoetze doesn't take a salary from Physical Phones and supports herself with earnings from her CatGPT media business, which includes branded content and content partnerships.She recently hired a CEO, Josh Silverman, who was brought on during the first round of production and now runs the business day-to-day. Looking ahead, 2026 is all about growing Physical Phones through potentially selling to retail, Goetze says.Cat Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new products, apps, websites and services.Tristan Pelletier | CNBC Make It\"One of the main questions that we're toying with right now is: Do we want to continue to have this sort of drop model where we ship out large quantities of inventory at a time, or do we want to have more of a traditional e-commerce or evergreen model where we have stock consistently?\" she says. \"There's pros and cons to each.\"Goetze is soon launching Cat Labs, a creator-first product studio where she plans to build new      products, apps, websites and services.\"As a creator-founder,\" Goetze says, \"my zone of genius, if you will, comes from my ability to stick that cultural antenna up into the air and understand what my audience wants, and being able to predict and build what they want next.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "When it comes to identifying great ideas, billionaire Barry Diller has a simple piece of advice: Don't be a cynic.Diller is a big fan of \"creative conflict\" group brainstorming sessions, he said in an interview for an episode of CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook,\" set to air on Wednesday. In a creative conflict setting, team members passionately argue about an idea, weighing differing opinions for however long it takes to reach a decision. It can be \"loud and argumentative ... and somewhat brutal,\" but \"I think it's a great environment,\" he said.For group brainstorming to work effectively, resulting in top-tier ideas, you'll need to genuinely consider other people's opinions, said Diller, chairman and senior executive of holding company IAC and travel technology company Expedia Group.\"You have to try and be naive,\" said Diller, 83, who also co-founded the Fox Broadcasting Company. \"You cannot be cynical. Cynicism kills everything. You have to force naivete.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsIf you're cynical, you may think your team member is pitching an idea that only benefits them — or that since you've been at your organization the longest, you naturally know more than the next person.Instead of being dismissive, go into these ideation sessions with a beginner's attitude, said Diller, who has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. That doesn't mean being foolish, ignorant or easily steamrolled — rather, you're open to fresh perspectives, learning something new and being challenged.\"I've always held on to being a dopey naive as much as I can,\" said Diller. \"You know, as you go through life, you just get more sophisticated and the natural tendencies get more cynical. If you want to use your instincts, you have to brush that clean every day practically.\"How listening can help you make difficult decisionsThe value of considering your colleagues' unconventional ideas can go beyond brainstorming.In the interview, Diller discussed IAC's purchase of a majority stake in Expedia. In July 2001, Diller made a deal to buy a 75% stake in Expedia for about $1 billion. Two months later, before the deal was completed, the September 11 terrorist attacks halted U.S. travel almost entirely.Expedia had \"zero revenue for a while, and it came back relatively quickly, but at that critical moment, when we had to make the decision, there was no business,\" said Diller. \"Several people said, 'This is not the time to pay over a billion dollars for something that, right now, is so completely unpredictable' ... But someone in the room, when we were talking about this, at the height of the argument, said, 'If there's life, there's travel.'\"\"As soon as I heard it, I said, 'Close [the deal]. I'm betting on that if there's life, there's travel ... and if there isn't life, then who cares anyway?' And that was it. It was very binary.\"Diller's IAC finally acquired Expedia in August 2003, and Diller helped steer the company through the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. Expedia Group now owns and operates several other travel sites including Hotels.com, Vrbo, Travelocity and Trivago, and currently has a $36.44 billion market cap.Watch Barry Diller on CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook″ on Wednesday, Jan. 14 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT. All new episodes Wednesdays.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Wages have largely kept up with inflation since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 — but for many workers, it hasn't felt like much of a win.Price increases and pay gains have seesawed over the past five years, leaving inflation-adjusted wages roughly flat overall since 2020.Meanwhile, inflation reached a post-pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but has since cooled. New inflation data released Tuesday shows consumer prices rose by a year-over-year rate of 2.7% in December, according to the Consumer Price Index, which tracks the prices of things people buy regularly, from groceries and rent to gasoline and medical care. That brings it closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but even so, inflation has remained above that level since February 2021, and many households are feeling the squeeze.Slower inflation doesn't mean prices are falling — it means they're rising more slowly. Since early 2020, cumulative CPI inflation is up by roughly 25%, marking one of the fastest increases in decades. Those higher prices are now part of everyday household budgets, especially for essentials like food and housing.\"Even though inflation has moderated, prices continue to rise, keeping it a persistent source of frustration,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It.Wages have caught up — but only barelyAfter falling behind during the inflation surge, wage growth has outpaced inflation over the past two years, allowing pay to catch up by most measures. Even so, over the full period since the pandemic began, inflation-adjusted wages show little net improvement overall.Since the first quarter of 2020, wages adjusted for CPI have been largely flat across several common measures, according to analysis from the Hamilton Project, a nonpartisan economic research group.Those measures include the closely watched Employment Cost Index, which tracks pay changes for the same set of jobs over time, making it a useful way to see how wages are rising relative to inflation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ECI, along with other common measures, show the total inflation-adjusted change since early 2020:Employment Cost Index: –0.19%Median weekly earnings: +0.41%Average hourly earnings: +0.44%Total compensation, including benefits: +1.25%Taken together, the data show that inflation-adjusted wage growth since 2020 has been close to zero.But for many workers, \"flat\" wages don't feel flat — they feel lagging. Take median weekly earnings, for instance: Inflation-adjusted pay is only slightly higher than it was five years ago, amounting to gains for some workers and little or none for many others.Kates says those uneven outcomes become clearer when wages are broken down by income level. Wage growth for lower-paid workers has slowed more sharply than for higher earners in recent years, based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. For households with less room in their budgets, slower wage growth makes it harder to absorb higher prices for everyday necessities.\"Median wage data masks various outcomes across the total population of workers. When wages are broken out by quartile, the lowest-income earners are seeing little to no inflation-adjusted growth,\" says Kates.For many workers, \"it feels like stagnation because it is,\" he says.The combination of modest wage gains and higher price levels may help explain why sentiment around household finances remains weak. In a November poll of 1,114 Americans from YouGov, 53% said their household income is just keeping up with expenses, while 32% said they are falling behind.Similarly, 62% of employed Americans say their income hasn't kept up with household expenses, according to a December Bankrate survey. Among those who don't expect their finances to improve in 2026, 65% cited inflation as the main reason, compared with about 30% who pointed to factors like government policies or stagnant income.For many Americans, flat real wages mean they're no longer losing ground as quickly — but they're not getting ahead either.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged that disconnect. Speaking in December, he said many households are still grappling with \"embedded higher cost due to higher inflation in 2022 and '23,\" even as inflation slows.\"We're going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher, significantly positive ... for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" Powell said.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Mahsa | Afp | Getty ImagesCrude oil prices rose more than 2% on Tuesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump canceled all meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that help is on the way. U.S. crude oil rose $1.65, or 2.77%, to close at $61.15 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent gained $1.60, or 2.51%, to settle at $65.47 per barrel. The Islamic Republic's security forces have cracked down on large-scale demonstrations with hundreds of people reportedly dead. The government has cut off Internet access in Iran, making it difficult to verify how the situation is evolving on the ground. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if the Islamic Republic kills protesters. \"Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday. \"They will pay a big price,\" the president said. \"I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!\"Iran is a member of OPEC and a major crude oil producer. The oil market is monitoring whether the unrest could lead to a disruption of supplies.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGlobal central bankers issued a statement Tuesday defending U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the launch of a criminal investigation into the central bank chief. \"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" central bank chiefs including European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, said in a joint statement. \"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability,\" they added.Powell has served with \"integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the statement said. \"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"Other signatories to the statement included the central bank chiefs of Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Australia and Canada.watch nowThe message of solidarity with Powell comes after the Fed chief issued a statement on Sunday evening confirming that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into the $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and his related testimony to Congress.Powell, who has come under sustained pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower interest rates, said the probe was the result of the president's frustration to cut rates as quickly and as much as he wanted.\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.Powell warned that the outcome of the investigation will determine the future of the central bank's decisions.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. — CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed reporting to this story.

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

    "body": "Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Nov. 4th, 2025.CNBCExecutives of artificial intelligence startup Percepta AI, who were sued last year by Palantir for allegedly stealing confidential information and trying to poach top talent, called the claims an attempt to \"stifle competition.\" \"In truth, Palantir is looking to scare others away from leaving and to destroy Percepta before it can grow further,\" lawyers for the defendants wrote in a filing this week, asking a judge to deny Palantir's request. The defendants also claim that post-employment agreements are \"facially overbroad and unenforceable\" and say Palantir's interpretation is meant to \"stifle competition.\"The lawsuit, originally filed by Palantir in October in the Southern District of New York, accused Percepta co-founder and CEO Hirsh Jain and co-founder Radha Jain of using stolen information to create a \"copycat\" business. Palantir also claimed the founders, who used to work for the data analytics company, attempted to poach talent and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\" Palantir accused a third Percepta employee, Joanna Cohen, of sending herself confidential documents after resigning and photographing sensitive information she downloaded to her personal phone. Percepta in December denied using any of Palantir's confidential information and called the case \"baseless.\"Attorneys said in Monday's filing that in-depth searches did not find any Palantir materials and argued that the screenshots taken by Cohen were done in \"good faith\" to help her complete tasks. They said the materials \"would be useless to Percepta and are by now stale regardless.\"Palantir declined to comment. WATCH: Highlights of DealBook Summit 2025watch now",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum hinted Tuesday the industry could fight President Donald Trump's demand for credit card price controls, saying \"everything's on the table.\" \"If you wind up with weakly supported directives to radically change our business that aren't justified, you have to assume that everything's on the table,\" Barnum said on a call with reporters following JPMorgan's fourth-quarter earnings report. \"We owe that to shareholders.\"Barnum was responding to a question about whether banks would choose to litigate to block Trump's demand, made late Friday, that card companies cap interest rates at 10% for a year. Last year, the industry successfully fought efforts by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to cap card late fees.Banks and industry insiders say that an interest rate limit would result in fewer credit card accounts for Americans and a dip in spending for the U.S. economy, as companies would simply pull accounts rather than offer them at an unprofitable level.The average credit card rate nationally is 19.7% as of this month, according to a weekly survey from Bankrate.com, while rates for subprime borrowers and store-specific cards are typically higher.\"Our belief is that actions like this will have the exact opposite consequence to what the administration wants for consumers,\" Barnum said. \"Instead of lowering the price of credit, we'll simply reduce the supply of credit, and that will be bad for everyone: consumers, the wider economy, and yes, at the margin, for us.\"The CFO declined to directly answer a question on whether JPMorgan would comply with Trump's demand, which has a proposed Jan. 20 start date. Banks that don't follow the directive are \"in violation of the law,\" Trump told reporters Sunday.Still, it's unclear how Trump's mandate would be enforced. There is no U.S. law capping card rates, though a bill was introduced last year from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years. That bill is stalled in Congress.Other voices in the corporate and political realms began addressing the possible impact of Trump's rate cap on Tuesday. Beyond banks, airlines and retailers rely on revenue from card partnerships to bolster profit. For instance, Delta Air Lines said Tuesday that its American Express partnership produced $8.2 billion in revenue last year.Delta CEO Ed Bastian said on an earnings call that the cap would \"upend the whole credit card industry ... I don't see any way we could even begin to contemplate how that would be implemented.\"House Speaker Mike Johnson struck a note of caution when asked about the issue at a news conference.\"We have a lot of work to go [on] consensus around it, but you got to be very careful as we go forward in that in our zeal to bring down costs — you don't want to have negative secondary effects,\" Johnson said. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.  watch now",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter results that topped expectations on better-than-expected revenue from the bank's trading operations. Here's what the company reported:Adjusted earnings: $5.23 per share vs. $5 consensus estimate from LSEGRevenue: $46.77 billion vs. $46.201 billion expected by LSEGThe company said profit fell 7% to $13.03 billion, or $4.63 per share, because of a preannounced $2.2 billion reserve tied to its takeover of the Apple Card loan portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Excluding the 60 cent per share hit from that transaction, adjusted earnings came in at $5.23 and topped analysts' expectations.Companywide revenue rose 7% to $46.77 billion as net interest income also climbed by 7% to $25.1 billion, roughly matching analyst expectations for NII, according to StreetAccount. Equities trading revenue surged 40% to $2.9 billion, about $350 million more than analysts had expected, as the company cited strength across operations, especially in its business catering to hedge funds. Fixed income trading revenue rose 7% to $5.4 billion, about $110 million more than expected, according to StreetAccount.Investment banking, however, appeared to disappoint, as fees fell 5% to $2.3 billion, roughly $210 million below the StreetAccount estimate. Shares of the bank were down 3% in morning trading. Banks have enjoyed a Goldilocks-type environment for the last few quarters, with a rebound in Wall Street trading, falling interest rates, stable consumer credit and deregulation providing a lift for the sector. High stock levels have also buoyed banks' wealth management divisions.The KBW Bank Index climbed 29% last year, the second year in a row that the big bank benchmark exceeded the gains of the S&P 500.'Potential hazards'In remarks in the earnings release, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called the U.S. economy resilient.\"While labor markets have softened, conditions do not appear to be worsening. Meanwhile, consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy,\" Dimon said.\"These conditions could persist for some time, particularly with ongoing fiscal stimulus, the benefits of deregulation and the Fed's recent monetary policy,\" he said. \"However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards—including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.\"The bank said it expects full-year 2026 net interest income of about $103 billion and adjusted expenses of roughly $105 billion, though both measures are \"market dependent.\"Analysts will be keen to hear how much banking momentum from 2025 is expected to carry over into this year. Of particular concern is whether there are any cracks in spending amid signs that the labor market may be weakening, as well as guidance around the strength of Wall Street deal-making. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report results Wednesday, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting Thursday. watch now",

    "body": "A grocery store in the Manhattan borough of New York on Dec. 13, 2025.Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesProgress in the fight to throttle back inflation appeared to stall in December amid price pressures from groceries, dining out, utility gas, clothing and other categories of consumer spending. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.7% in December from 12 months earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. That was unchanged from the previous month and in line with estimates.\"The bottom line is, I think inflation is still uncomfortably high,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. \"Inflation for staples, necessities, remains elevated.\"Tariffs are pushing up inflationThe Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, targets an annual inflation rate that averages roughly 2% over the long term. Tariffs levied by President Donald Trump have put upward pressure on the inflation rate, Zandi said. Tariffs are a tax on imports, paid by the U.S.-based importer. Economists have expected that businesses would pass along at least some of that tax to consumers via higher prices.  \"I think were it not for the tariffs, we would have been back to target already,\" Zandi said. \"But tariffs have pushed up inflation a little over half a [percentage] point.\"That said, the pass-through to consumers has been more muted than expected, likely because businesses have chosen to erode their profit margins rather than risk alienating consumers via higher prices, economists said. Companies with inventory imported to the U.S. before tariffs were implemented were also able to sell those products to consumers at typical prices. The Supreme Court is poised to deliver a ruling in the coming days or weeks that could strike down a legal pathway the Trump administration has leveraged to impose universal tariffs on a broad swath of trading partners. Even without such a ruling, economists said they expect inflation has peaked and that it will likely throttle back in the second half of 2026. \"Short of any new tariffs coming online, we think the direction of inflation is lower,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief economist at Wells Fargo.Good news for the Federal ReserveOverall, the headline inflation rate is higher than it appears on paper, Zandi said. The record-long government shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12, prevented federal statisticians from collecting typical inflation data in October. Without that data, the BLS assumed that no price increases had taken place during the month for most categories of goods and services, Zandi said. Moody's estimates the annual CPI inflation rate would be around 3% if that data were included, he said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageAs enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, millions poised to drop health insuranceBigger tax refunds are coming for 2026 — what it could mean for the economyHere's the inflation breakdown for December 2025 — in one chartMore drivers have $1,000-plus car loan payments.

Consumer staples spur affordability concernsAffordability has emerged as a key financial focus for consumers and a talking point for politicians. Inflation for certain household necessities increased in December. For example, food prices for groceries and at restaurants each increased 0.7% on a monthly basis, from November to December, according to the CPI report. For inflation to get back to target, the monthly inflation rate generally needs to be around 0.2%.Certain categories like coffee and beef have seen high inflation rates over the past year — about 20% and 16%, respectively — due to supply constraints. Clothing prices were also up about 0.6% on a monthly basis. However, some increases may appear larger than in reality due to data distortions caused by the government shutdown, according to economists. \"Goods inflation appeared firmer than underlying trends would suggest, largely because holiday discounts were over-represented in November's CPI report due to how data was gathered during the government shutdown,\" Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas at BlackRock, wrote in a note Tuesday. \"Those deeper-than-normal discounts pulled prices down in November, setting up an artificial jump when prices normalized later in December.\"watch nowUtility piped gas service increased 4.4% on the month, and is up 11% for the year. Electricity prices declined by 0.1% for the month but were up about 7% for the year. On a positive note, housing is likely to act as a counterweight pulling down overall inflation in 2026 and into 2027, Zandi said. \"Rent growth remains very weak,\" he said.",

    "body": "Eugene Mymrin | Moment | Getty ImagesAll computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand.That's because companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components. Three primary memory vendors — Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand. \"We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income nearly tripled in the most recent quarter. Samsung this week said that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is considering a U.S. listing as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand for its entire 2026 RAM production capacity. Now, prices for memory are rising. TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\" Three-to-one basisChipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers. Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduces the Rubin GPU and the Vera CPU as he speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 5, 2026. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBut the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\"When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices.\"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said. Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive. In December, Micron said it would discontinue a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers. Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased. Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time. \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday.watch now'Memory wall'AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and Meta.Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.  While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs. \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said. The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\" Erik Isakson | Digitalvision | Getty Images\"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said.More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience. Majestic Labs is designing an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power.Sold out for 2026 Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like Apple and Dell Technologies, how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025. In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\"But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices. \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\"Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products.At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage. Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high.\"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said. At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030.But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said. ",

    "body": "watch nowCore U.S. consumer prices rose less than predicted in December, reinforcing hopes that inflation is tempering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next move on interest rates.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the consumer price index showed a seasonally adjusted 0.2% gain on a monthly basis and 2.6% annually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. Both were 0.1 percentage point below expectations. Though they look at both measures, Fed officials consider core inflation a better long-run gauge of where inflation is heading.On a headline basis, the CPI posted an increase of 0.3% for the month, putting the all-items annual rate at 2.7%. Both were exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate.The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually, so the report provides some evidence that the pace of price increases is moving back to target but remains elevated.Stock market futures briefly rose following the report while Treasury yields were lower. Traders kept bets intact that the Fed would stand pat at its meeting later this month and likely won't be considering another cut until June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.President Donald Trump used the CPI report to renew his calls on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease monetary policy.\"Great (LOW!) Inflation numbers for the USA. That means that Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should cut interest rates, MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"If he doesn't he will just continue to be 'TOO LATE!'\"Shelter, a key element of stickiness, increased 0.4%, which was the biggest item for the monthly increase, according to the BLS. The category accounts for more than one-third of the CPI weighting and was up 3.2% on an annual basis.Other parts of the report also showed inflation persisting.Food prices jumped 0.7% for the month, though egg prices tumbled 8.2% and fell nearly 21% from a year ago after soaring previously. Other areas seeing increases included recreation, airfares and medical care. Energy prices rose 0.3% on the month and were up 2.3% from a year ago, though gasoline declined 0.5% and 3.4%, respectively.Some tariff-sensitive categories including apparel, also posted gains. However, household furnishings saw a 0.5% decrease as President Donald Trump backed off on threatened tariff increases for imports in that sector.The 1.2% increase for recreation was the largest monthly gain ever for the index in data going back to 1993, the BLS said.The report likely keeps the central bank on hold at least for the moment. Policymakers cut their benchmark rate three times in the latter part of 2025, and markets expect them to stay on hold through the first half of the new year as they assess the impact of the cuts on general economic conditions.\"We've seen this movie before — inflation isn't reheating, but it remains above target,\" wrote Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"There's still only modest pass-through from tariffs, but housing affordability isn't thawing. Today's inflation report doesn't give the Fed what it needs to cut interest rates later this month.\"Fed officials currently are weighing risks to the labor market against the potential for inflation to linger. Trump's tariffs have added another wrinkle to the equation, though most policymakers see the impact on inflation as temporary.Some areas of the report, particularly in goods, showed signs of deflation. Used cars and trucks declined 1.1% and the communication index slipped 1.9%. New vehicle prices were flat.Tuesday's release brings the BLS current on inflation and employment after the government shutdown last year caused a suspension of data collection and reports. Figuring in the December price increase, real wages were flat for the month and up 1.1% from a year ago, the BLS said in a separate report.",

David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing logged net orders for 1,173 airplanes last year, marking the first time it outsold its European rival Airbus since 2018, the latest sign of Boeing's recovery.Boeing handed over 63 jetliners to customers last month, bringing its annual delivery total to 600 aircraft, the most in seven years, before two deadly crashes and a host of other problems derailed its output. Forty-four of those deliveries were 737 Maxes, Boeing said Tuesday.Airbus still delivered more aircraft last year than Boeing, with 793, though that sum is below the record 863 airplanes the European manufacturer handed over in 2019. Airbus had 889 net orders for 2025.Engine and other supply chain issues continue to hold up aircraft deliveries. Deliveries are key for airplane manufacturers because airlines pay the bulk of a jet's price when they receive the plane.Boeing's net orders last month totaled 174 planes, including more than 100 737 Maxes for Alaska Airlines, which the Seattle carrier announced last week. Delta Air Lines earlier Tuesday said it ordered at least 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, its first for the wide-body plane. Deliveries are starting in the early 2030s, a sign of how airlines are locking in delivery slots into the next decade to replace older jets and grow.Boeing executives are scheduled to discuss the manufacturer's production plan when the company reports quarterly results on Jan. 27.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing's deliveries are highest in 7 years.

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore has claimed the top position in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) for the first time, bolstered by its robust education systems, sound governance and a proactive approach to sustaining an adaptive, innovation-ready workforce in the age of artificial intelligence.In its 11th edition this year, the index — produced by business school INSEAD and in partnership with D.C.-based think tank Portulans Institute — measured how countries grow, attract and retain talent across all income groups.This year's report, themed \"resilience in the age of disruption,\" ranked 135 economies globally on 77 indicators such as soft skills and AI talent concentration across six pillars.This report comes at a time when \"rapid technological change, geopolitical uncertainty and profound societal transitions make dependable talent metrics more essential than ever,\" said Rafael Escalona Reynoso, CEO of Portulans Institute.While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety.Lily FangDean of research and innovation, INSEAD\"While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety,\" said INSEAD's dean of research and innovation, Lily Fang. \"Geopolitical uncertainty poses massive challenges to the resilience of global commerce and markets, while artificial intelligence presents both amazing opportunities to enhance human potential — but also unfathomable risks.\"Here are the top 10 countries in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index: SingaporeSwitzerlandDenmarkFinlandSwedenNetherlandsNorwayLuxembourgUnited StatesAustralia Notably, Switzerland was leapfrogged by Singapore and fell from its top position for the first time in the history of the GTCI. However, the country records multiple top-five results across the study's framework, including internet access in schools (1st), government effectiveness (2nd), and AI skills migration (4th).High-income European countries continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for seven of the top ten positions. Switzerland, Denmark and Finland closely follow each other in the top ten, \"suggesting a shared focus on enabling and retaining talent through favorable conditions and access to opportunities,\" according to the report. These three countries consistently rank near the top in enabling and retaining talent.Several Nordic countries have jumped places in the top ten since the last GTCI in 2023. Denmark moved up one position to 3rd this year from 4th in the 2023 report, Finland jumped two places from 6th to 4th, and Sweden jumped four places from 9th in rank in 2023 to 4th this year. Meanwhile, the United States fell from third place in 2023 to ninth in this year's report — its weakest showing since 2013. Although the U.S. scored strongly in areas such as enabling and growing talent, \"slight declines in the categories of openness and lifelong learning\" pushed the country down to ninth place in 2025, according to the report.Singapore takes the leadSingapore's rise marks a big milestone for both the country and the wider region in the competition for talent, the report said.The city-state \"ranks in the top ten across four of the six pillars and has made notable improvements in its ability to retain talent, rising seven positions,\" according to the report. The Southeast Asian country also leads globally in enabling and retaining talent, which is supported by the country's regulatory landscape and high standards of living. The country also ranked first globally in formal education and \"Generalist Adaptive Skills,\" which spans soft skills, digital literacy, and innovation-oriented thinking.A key driver of Singapore's jump this year is a sharp improvement in its ability to retain talent, jumping seven places from 38th in 2023 to 31st this year. The report pointed to gains in areas such as physician density, personal rights, personal safety and more. \"Economies that cultivate adaptable, cross-functional and AI-literate workforces tend to be better positioned to convert disruption into opportunity and sustain long-term competitiveness,\" says Paul Evans, emeritus professor of organisational behaviour at INSEAD and co-editor of the report.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Colder weather and, for many, some time off for the holidays makes winter a perfect time of year to \"catch up on reading,\" according to billionaire and avid reader Bill Gates.\"There's something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,\" Gates wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday that includes his latest annual list of holiday season book recommendations.Gates' list of \"recent favorites\" includes a wide variety of authors and genres, from a book by a Harvard psychologist that dissects the concept of \"common knowledge\" to a fictional work about an aging night janitor in an aquarium. The list also features a media mogul's recent memoir, a book that Gates calls a \"hopeful, fact-driven overview\" of the current climate crisis, and a nonfiction political bestseller about government regulations and American innovation.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at work\"Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate, and how America lost its capacity to build big things — and how to get it back,\" wrote Gates.Here are the five books Gates recommends reading during this holiday season:'Remarkably Bright Creatures' by Shelby Van PeltTold partially from the perspective of an octopus, Van Pelt's 2022 novel meets Gates' top condition for any work of fiction, he wrote: \"I want to read about interesting characters who help me see the world in a new way.\"Gates, who turned 70 in October, also wrote that he related to the book's human protagonist: a 70-year-old widow named Tova, a janitor working the night shift at the aquarium housing Marcellus the octopus. The book follows a developing friendship between Tova and Marcellus, and Gates referred to it as a thought-provoking exploration of \"relationships and getting older,\" particularly struggles with loneliness and the search for meaning as one enters the final chapter of their life.\"Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working — and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,\" wrote Gates, who has previously said that retirement \"sounds awful.\"'Clearing the Air' by Hannah RitchieHannah Ritchie is a University of Oxford data scientist who Gates has previously touted for her \"surprisingly optimistic\" analyses of the ongoing fight against climate change. Her latest book — which published in the U.K. on Sept. 18, and is set to publish in the U.S. in March 2026 — \"is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I've read,\" Gates wrote.In \"Clearing the Air,\" Ritchie focuses on 50 questions about the climate crisis — like, whether renewable energy alternatives are too expensive to be effective, or if it's too late to limit global warming and avoid further climate disasters — offering answers that are \"realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,\" Gates wrote.Like Ritchie, Gates has touted the environmental movement's progress — from increased use of solar and wind power to the popularity of electric vehicles — and rejected a \"doomsday outlook\" of climate change that the billionaire worries could distract us from other areas of concern, he wrote in a separate blog post in October.Gates has spent decades, and billions of dollars, on combatting climate change. He recently drew some criticism from scientists for arguing that some of the resources earmarked for climate initiatives would be better used on issues like welfare and poverty.\"If you want a hopeful, fact-driven overview of where climate solutions stand, this is a great pick,\" Gates wrote of Ritchie's book on Tuesday.'Who Knew' by Barry DillerBarry Diller, the billionaire IAC and Expedia chairman who also co-founded Fox Broadcasting, published his memoir in May 2025. Even though Gates considers Diller a longtime friend, he wrote, the media mogul's book \"still managed to surprise and teach me a lot about him, his career, and the many industries he's transformed.\"Diller is credited with inventing concepts like the made-for-television movie and TV miniseries during his years as an entertainment executive. Later, Diller \"was early to see the internet's potential and willing to bet on it when others weren't,\" including buying Expedia from Microsoft in 2001 and building IAC into one of the earliest media and internet conglomerates, Gates noted.Gates considered Diller's book to be insightful about the mogul's rise to corporate power, he wrote — and \"raw and honest\" about Diller's personal life, including a decision to come out as gay earlier this year at age 83.'When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows' by Steven Pinker\"Few people explain the mysteries of human behavior better than Steven Pinker,\" Gates wrote about the professor of psychology at Harvard University who studies how humans interact. Pinker's latest book, which published on Sept. 23, \"is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn more about how people communicate,\" Gates wrote.In \"When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows,\" Pinker explores how \"common knowledge\" shapes so many aspects of our lives, including how we communicate and work with others. And as Gates wrote: \"Most people would benefit from understanding how common knowledge props up every conversation we have,\" and how to used that shared understanding to more effectively collaborate with others.\"Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,\" Gates wrote.'Abundance' by Ezra Klein and Derek ThompsonWritten by two journalists — Thompson is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and Klein is a columnist at The New York Times and co-founder of Vox — \"Abundance\" offers \"a sharp look at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that,\" wrote Gates.Klein and Thompson argue that regulations, particularly some championed by progressive politicians, have stymied U.S. development in areas ranging from infrastructure and affordable housing to scientific breakthroughs. To fix the bottleneck, the writers propose an \"abundance agenda\" that would promote spending on development while cutting back on red tape to help accelerate the pace of new projects.The book has critics on both sides of the political aisle, and Gates wrote that it \"doesn't have all the answers.\" However, the writers \"are asking the right questions\" based on Gates' own experiences working with government agencies on large-scale global health and climate technology projects, he wrote.\"I've seen how the bottlenecks discussed in 'Abundance' impede progress in global health — whether we're trying to improve seeds, design better toilets, or eradicate polio,\" Gates wrote. \"Sometimes the science itself is hard. But often, the logistics and execution are even harder.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates have hovered around the same range for roughly two months, giving current borrowers nor potential homebuyers little incentive to get into the market. Total mortgage application volume was essentially flat last week, up just 0.2% from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances $806,500 or less increased to 6.40% from 6.37%, with points decreasing to 0.60 from 0.62, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the highest since early October. Last year, during the same week, the average rate was 46 basis points higher. Despite the slight rate increase, applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 8% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week a year ago. That was driven by buyers looking for cheaper loans. The government purchase index, which includes FHA, VA, and USDA applications, increased 9% for the week and had its strongest week since 2023.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Affordability remains a challenge in many markets and government loan programs remain appealing to qualified buyers looking to purchase a home. The average purchase loan size decreased to its lowest level in two months,\" said Joel Kan, MBA Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 6% for the week but were 117% higher than the same week one year ago. That enormous annual difference is not because of any refinance boom; it's simply that the numbers were so very low a year ago. Mortgage rates dropped back a bit to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily (MND). \"Rather than credit any of the recent underlying events, the improvement in rates/bonds has more to do with idiosyncratic trading conditions that are often seen on major holiday weeks,\" explained Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND. \"That said, some of [Tuesday's] data and events contributed. These include another weak reading in weekly employment numbers from ADP as well as a reaction to rumors that rate-friendly Kevin Hassett will be the next Fed Chair.\"",

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesConsumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday.The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2.In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points.\"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\"A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration.The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no hire, no fire\" current job climate showing in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point.Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers.For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago.The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December.In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups.\"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\"Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year.Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.",

We're grateful for his contributions and wish him continued success. With hardware and software engineering unified under Global Product, we're integrating product management with engineering to accelerate the delivery of exceptional in-vehicle experiences,\" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC.Cetinok, who joined GM in September 2023 after stints with companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could not immediately be reached for comment. The announcement of his departure comes a month after he described his position as \"a product person's dream\" in an interview with CNBC.GM's senior vice president of software and services engineering, Dave Richardson, and its head of GM artificial intelligence, Barak Turovsky, have also left the company since October.

GM CEO Mary Barra and GM President Mark Reuss also hailed Anderson as being equipped to \"evolve\" and \"reinvent\" the automaker's operations.The global automotive industry has battled for years to better integrate technology into vehicles – from their production to consumer-facing software and remote, or \"over-the-air,\" updates like Tesla pioneered.GM has taken an aggressive approach to combat such challenges by hiring leaders from Tesla and technology companies such as Apple and Google. However, many times, such executives have had short tenures with the company.",

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWorkday shares slid more than 5% in extended trading Tuesday after the finance and human resources software maker issued quarterly margin guidance that came in below Wall Street projections.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.18 expectedRevenue: $2.43 billion vs. $2.42 billion expectedThe company forecast a fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin of at least 28.5% and $2.355 billion in subscription revenue, according to a statement. The StreetAccount consensus was a 28.7% margin and $2.35 billion in subscription revenue.Workday's revenue grew about 13% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Net income of $252 million, or 94 cents per share, was up from $193 million, or 72 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.Subscription revenue in the third quarter totaled $2.24 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 28.5%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated $2.24 billion in subscription revenue and a 28.1% margin.During the fiscal third quarter, Workday announced artificial intelligence agents for analyzing employee performance testing financial health, and the company revealed plans to buy AI and learning software startup Sana for $1.1 billion. Also, activist investor Elliott Management said it had built a Workday stake worth over $2 billion.Workday encountered some turbulence with higher education institutions that rely on U.S. funding, CEO Carl Eschenbach said on a conference call with analysts. Workday has seen its stock decline this year as pundits discuss the risk of generative AI tools threatening the growth prospects for cloud software incumbents. Company shares have fallen 9% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite index has gained 19%.\"The narrative we've been hearing in the last couple of quarters is changing, and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers,\" Eschenbach said. Despite rounds of layoffs that companies have been carrying out in recent months, the headcount in Workday's customer base is up year over year, he said.WATCH: Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach: There's a narrative that AI is eating into software, that is falsewatch now",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on November 19, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesNvidia on Tuesday said its tech remains a generation ahead of the industry, in response to Wall Street's concerns that the company's dominance of AI infrastructure could be threatened by Google's AI chips.\"We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,\" Nvidia said in a post on X. \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"The post came after Nvidia saw its shares fall 3% on Tuesday after a report that Meta, one of its key customers, could strike a deal with Google to use its tensor processing units for its data centers. In its post, Nvidia said its chips are more flexible and powerful compared with so-called ASIC chips — such as Google's TPUs — which are designed for a single company or function. Nvidia's latest generation of chips are known as Blackwell. \"NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,\" Nvidia said in its post. Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for artificial intelligence chips with its graphics processors, analysts say, but Google's in-house chips have gotten increased attention in recent weeks as a viable alternative to the Blackwell chips, which are expensive but powerful. Unlike Nvidia, Google doesn't sell its TPU chips to other companies, but it uses them for internal tasks and allows companies to rent them through Google Cloud. Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 3, a well-reviewed state-of-the-art AI model that was trained on the company's TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. \"We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed rising TPU competition on an earnings call earlier this month, noting that Google was a customer for his company's GPU chips and that Gemini can run on Nvidia's technology. He also mentioned that he was in touch with Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Huang said that Hassabis texted him to say that the tech industry theory that using more chips and data will create more powerful AI models — often called \"scaling laws\" by AI developers — is \"intact.\" Nvidia says that scaling laws will lead to even more demand for the company's chips and systems.

Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

Here's how Dell did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: $2.59 adjusted versus $2.47 estimatedRevenue: $27.01 billion versus $27.13 billion estimatedDell said it expects about $31.5 billion in sales in the fourth quarter versus $27.59 billion estimated by analysts. The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.50 versus $3.21 expected. The company said it was raising its expectations for AI server shipments during the year to $25 billion, up from $20 billion, and raised its full-year revenue guidance to $111.7 billion from $107 billion.Dell reported $1.54 billion in net income, or $2.28 per diluted share, during the quarter, versus $1.17 billion, or $1.64, in the year-ago period. The company is an important bellwether for the health of the AI infrastructure industry as one of the top vendors for systems based around Nvidia's graphics processors. Overall revenue in the quarter rose 11% on an annual basis. Dell's main customers for its artificial intelligence systems are big businesses, governments and so-called neoclouds like CoreWeave. Dells sells less to big cloud companies typically called hyperscalers, which have been the most voracious Nvidia buyers so far. The company said it expects to sell $9.4 billion of AI servers in the fourth quarter, and that doesn't include a deal announced in November to sell Nvidia-based GB300 systems to Iren, a neocloud that plans to rent them out to Microsoft. Dell's data center business, called Infrastructure Solutions Group, reported $14.11 billion in sales, in-line with analyst estimates. Of that, $10.1 billion was for servers and networking parts, which was up 37% on an annual basis. Much of that increase was driven by $5.6 billion in AI server shipments. Dell said it sold $4 billion of storage gear during the quarter.But the company said that its laptop and PC business, called Client Solutions Group, reported $12.48 billion in sales, which was up 3% year-over-year but slightly lower than the $12.65 billion expected by analysts. Dell's laptop and PC business was hit particularly hard, declining 7% on an annual basis. The company said it spent $1.6 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersGobble and Waddle won't get gobbled this Thanksgiving — they're waddling off to freedom instead after President Donald Trump granted pardons to those two turkeys on Tuesday.During the traditional Rose Garden ceremony in which the birds get spared from the butcher, Trump also suggested a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Ukraine and Russia soon could come to fruition.\"I think we're getting very close to a deal; we'll find out,\" Trump said. \"I think we're making progress.\"Trump also bashed former President Joe Biden, claiming that his predecessor used an autopen to sign last year's turkey pardons, making them \"totally invalid.\" Trump cracked that he has \"officially pardoned\" those other birds, Peach and Blossom, adding that he \"saved them in the nick of time.\"Gobble and Waddle were raised on a small farm in Wayne County, North Carolina, owned by Travis and Amanda Pittman, who raised turkeys for Butterball.First lady Melania Trump's office had encouraged Americans to text \"Gobble\" or \"Waddle\" to 45470 to decide which bird would receive the formal pardon. Earlier this year, she posted a poll on X to name the birds.Born in July and weighing 52 and 50 pounds respectively, Gobble and Waddle spent the past week getting used to noise, lights, and crowds before checking into their ceremonial suite at the Willard InterContinental Hotel — a long-running perk of being a presidential turkey.The National Thanksgiving Turkeys from North Carolina, named Waddle and Gobble, wait in their room a day ahead of their Thanksgiving holiday pardoning at the White House, at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 24, 2025.

Alex Wroblewski | Afp | Getty ImagesExperts previously told CNBC that retailers who ordered turkeys early locked in lower prices, while others relying on the spot market are facing steeper costs. Wells Fargo's agriculture team said there could be a $20 difference in the price of comparably sized turkeys depending on where consumers shopped.Major retailers have offered holiday promotions to lure cost-conscious shoppers.Walmart is advertising a dinner bundle for 10 people for under $56; Aldi has one for $40; Amazon is offering a $25 dinner promotion; and Target announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Despite elevated turkey prices, the broader Thanksgiving meal for 10 is less expensive for the third straight year, according to the AFBF. A \"classic\" 16-pound turkey dinner with sides averages $55.18 nationwide.The annual turkey presentation dates to the 1940s and became a formal presidential pardon in 1989 under George H. W. Bush. But presidents have been gifted turkeys since the 1870s, according to the White House Historical Association. Over time, the rite has evolved into soft marketing for America's multibillion-dollar  poultry industry.This year's moment of pageantry comes in a second term where Trump has leaned heavily on his actual pardon power, granting relief to more than 1,000 January 6 rioters and high-profile figures including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, disgraced former representative George Santos and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. ",

They are seeking \"treble damages\" under a law allowing victims of international terrorism to recover three times the damages they sustained.Binance was legally required to flag the U.S. government by filing \"Suspicious Activity Reports,\" or SARs, on the terror groups' activities. But instead, the company attempted to manipulate how the transactions were reported \"to avoid attracting scrutiny,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"Binance not only knowingly provided financial services to Hamas; it actively tried to shield its Hamas customers and their funds from scrutiny by U.S. regulators or law enforcement—a practice that continues to this day,\" according to the lawsuit.The legal complaint says that since the Oct. 7 attacks, Binance \"knowingly facilitated the equivalent of more than $50 million U.S. dollars in transactions ... for Hamas, the IRGC, Hezbollah, and PIJ on public blockchains.\"Binance declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement that it fully complies with international sanctions laws and has \"executed a wide-ranging transformation\" of its sanctions framework in recent years.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen. Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'The suit cites the findings of the federal government's investigations into Binance, which culminated in late 2023 with the company agreeing to pay more than $4.3 billion — one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Additionally, then-CEO CZ agreed to step down and plead guilty to a charge of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. CZ was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in November 2023 that Binance failed to file SARs on \"significant sums being transmitted to and from entities officially designated as terrorist organizations\" by the U.S. and United Nations.Trump, on Oct. 23, pardoned CZ, whom the White House declared was a casualty of the Biden administration's \"war on cryptocurrency.\"Trump later denied knowing anything about CZ. But the president suggested granting a pardon to help the crypto industry flourish in the U.S., even as he stressed that he knows little about the industry and that his adult sons are much more involved.Indeed, Trump's family is heavily invested in the crypto industry and has financial ties to Binance itself. In May, the co-founder of the Trump family's crypto finance platform, World Liberty Financial, said the company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.",

    "body": "TAIPEI, TAIWAN - OCTOBER 10: Taiwan President Lai Ching-te (William Lai) delivers a national day address, during the National Day Ceremony, outside the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan, on October 10, 2025. Daniel Ceng | Anadolu | Getty ImagesTaiwan will introduce a supplementary defense budget of 1.25 trillion Taiwanese dollars ($40 billion) as Beijing accelerates military preparations near the island, President Lai Ching-te said at a press briefing Wednesday.China has continued to increase military drills and so-called \"gray-zone harassment\" around Taiwan, with the goal of seizing the island by force by 2027, Lai said, according to a CNBC translation of his remarks in Mandarin. The speech comes in the aftermath of a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Taiwan. Lai added that Beijing had intensified its \"infiltration and influence campaign,\" using a range of tools to interfere in Taiwan's politics and society as it seeks to sway public opinion and undermine the island's democracy.He also cautioned \"unprecedented military buildup\" by Beijing and \"intensifying provocations in the Taiwan Strait, in the East and South China Seas, and across the Indo-Pacific.\" Beijing considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland \"a historical inevitability.\" Taiwan rejects those claims. China has been piling pressure on Taipei and has conducted several military drills off the coast of the island over the past few years, issuing stern warnings over Taiwan's \"provocations for independence.\"Beijing raised its defense budget by 7.2% this year to about $245 billion, with its military assets heavily deployed near the Taiwan Strait, according to analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lai on Wednesday vowed to build up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in the face of growing threats from Beijing, aiming to achieve a high level of combat readiness by 2027.  \"President Lai's announcement is a signal to Washington of Taipei's commitment to its self-defense and intent to increase imports to balance trade between the two,\" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Since his election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing allies to increase defense spending. Trump even suggested Taiwan should pay to be protected.     Shortly after Lai's speech, Raymond Greene, director of American Institute in Taiwan — the de facto U.S. embassy — said in a social media post that the United States \"welcomes\" the special defense budget and supports Taiwan's \"rapid acquisition of critical asymmetric capabilities needed to strengthen deterrence. When asked to comment on Taiwan's defense budget and Greene's comments, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a daily press briefing Wednesday that \"the Democratic Progressive Party's plan of resisting reunification and seeking independence using armed forces is doomed to fail.\" That's according to a CNBC's translation of the remarks in Mandarin. China has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Taiwan, with Beijing accusing Tokyo of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks \"egregious\" and has demanded a retraction.Trump spoke with Xi and Takaichi in separate phone calls on Monday. Experts say that Xi likely used the call to solicit Trump's help in influencing Takaichi to tone down her rhetoric on cross-Strait issues. ",

    "body": "Amazon's new MK30 Prime Air drone is displayed during Amazon's \"Delivering the Future\" event at the company's BFI1 Fulfillment Center, Robotics Research and Development Hub in Sumner, Washington on Oct. 18, 2023.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAmazon is facing a federal probe after one of its delivery drones downed an internet cable in central Texas last week. The probe comes as Amazon vies to expand drone deliveries to more pockets of the U.S., more than a decade after it first conceived the aerial distribution program, and faces stiffer competition from Walmart, which has also begun drone deliveries. The incident occurred on Nov. 18 around 12:45 p.m. Central in Waco, Texas. After dropping off a package, one of Amazon's MK30 drones was ascending out of a customer's yard when one of its six propellers got tangled in a nearby internet cable, according to a video of the incident viewed and verified by CNBC. The video shows the Amazon drone shearing the wire line. The drone's motor then appeared to shut off and the aircraft landed itself, with its propellers windmilling slightly on the way down, the video shows. The drone appeared to remain in tact beyond some damage to one of its propellers. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, a spokesperson confirmed. The National Transportation Safety Board said the agency is aware of the incident but has not opened a probe into the matter. Amazon confirmed the incident to CNBC, saying that after clipping the internet cable, the drone performed a \"safe contingent landing,\" referring to the process that allows its drones to land safely in unexpected conditions.\"There were no injuries or widespread internet service outages. We've paid for the cable line's repair for the customer and have apologized for the inconvenience this caused them,\" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, noting that the drone had completed its package delivery.watch nowThe incident comes after federal investigators last month opened a separate probe into a crash involving two of Amazon's Prime Air drones in Arizona. The two aircrafts collided with a construction crane in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, prompting Amazon to temporarily halt drone deliveries in the area.For over a decade, Amazon has been working to realize founder Jeff Bezos' vision of drones whizzing toothpaste, books and other goods to customers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less. The company began drone deliveries in 2022 in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California.But progress has been slowed by a mix of regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and layoffs in 2023 that coincided with broader cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The company has previously said its goal is to deliver 500 million packages by drone per year by the end of the decade. The hexacopter-shaped MK30, the latest generation of Amazon's Prime Air drone, is meant to be quieter, smaller and lighter than previous versions. Amazon says the drones are equipped with a sense-and-avoid system that enables them to \"detect and stay away from obstacles in the air and on the ground.\" The company recommends that customers maintain \"about 10 feet of open space\" on their property so drones can complete deliveriesThe company began drone deliveries in Waco earlier this month for customers within a certain radius of its same-day delivery site who order eligible items weighing 5 pounds or less. The drone deliveries are supposed to drop packages off in under an hour. Amazon has brought other locations online in recent months, including Kansas City, Missouri, Pontiac, Michigan, San Antonio, Texas, and Ruskin, Florida. Amazon has also announced plans to expand drone deliveries to Richardson, Texas. Walmart began offering drone deliveries in 2021, and currently partners with Alphabet's Wing and venture-backed startup Zipline to make drone deliveries in a number of states, including in Texas.WATCH: Amazon unveils satellite terminal for enterprise customers — but Starlink still dominateswatch now",

Mark Kelly of Arizona and five other congressional Democrats in connection with their appearance in a video encouraging members of the U.S. military to refuse to follow illegal orders, those lawmakers confirmed Tuesday.President Donald Trump last week blasted the video, accusing Kelly and the other lawmakers of \"seditious behavior,\" calling them \"traitors,\" and saying that, \"In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death.\"The other lawmakers on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps.

That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep  it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.\"Kelly's office told NBC News, \"Senator Kelly won't be silenced by President Trump and Secretary Hegseth's attempt to intimidate him and keep him from doing his job as a U.S. Senator.\"Fox News first reported on the FBI's efforts.Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lashed out online over Kelly's display of his U.S. Navy medals after the Pentagon began investigating him for encouraging service members to refuse to obey unlawful orders.\"So 'Captain' Kelly, not only did your sedition video intentionally undercut good order & discipline … but you can't even display your uniform correctly,\" Hegseth snapped in a post on X, which replied to a tweet by Kelly showing his medals.\"Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. When/if you are recalled to active duty, it'll start with a uniform inspection,\" said Hegseth, a former Fox News host and a former major in the Army National Guard.The Pentagon on Monday said it was investigating \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, who is a retired Navy captain, for his role in the video.

Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, blasted the Pentagon's investigation of Kelly and the FBI's probe of him and other lawmakers.\"Senator Kelly valiantly served our country as an aviator in the U.S. Navy before later completing four space shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut,\" Murkowski wrote in a post on X. \"To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong,\" she wrote. \"The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

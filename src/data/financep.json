    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Five years before Abi Caswell opened her own bakery, she had never made a single cookie. Today, she owns and manages two bake shops that bring in seven figures in sales, she says.Caswell, 30, is the founder of Batter, a bakery with two storefronts in Hammond, Louisiana and in New Orleans.Her ultimate goal has always been to own her own business, she tells CNBC Make It. \"Since I was a kid, I always knew I wanted to work for myself,\" she says. \"I wanted to be able to control my schedule, and I wanted to make my own money.\"Her interest in sweet treats began as a teenager: Caswell worked at a local cupcake shop from ages 16 to 20 and \"loved everything about it,\" though she wasn't involved in the baking process.After graduating from Louisiana State University of Alexandria in 2018 with a major in business administration and a minor in marketing, Caswell moved to Hammond with her husband Trey.While working full-time as an executive assistant, Caswell started experimenting with baking her own cakes as a hobby.After she made a cake for a friend's husband, \"one of our mutual friends was like, 'This is so good. You've got to sell these. We have nothing like this here,'\" Caswell recalls. Caswell initially planned to stick to cakes and cupcakes, she says, but with the rise of popular cookie chains like Crumbl and Insomnia Cookies — neither of which had storefronts in Hammond at the time, Caswell notes — she decided to capitalize on the craze and make cookies the focus of her baking side hustle.Courtesy of Abi CaswellFrom home baker to business owner In fall 2021, Caswell started experimenting with cookie recipes with the help of her husband Trey, who works as a high school basketball coach. It took Caswell six months to develop her now-signature chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"We made so many batches of cookies that were terrible,\" she says. \"They would just never be quite right because I had no clue what I was doing. So every time I made one, I just learned something new about it.\"She began posting her bakes online and on social media, and says she quickly attracted a strong local customer base.In spring 2022, Caswell left her full-time executive assistant job to focus on baking.\"I was going to work from 8 to 5:30 [p.m.], and then I was coming home and baking till like 1 a.m.,\" she recalls. \"It was just too much.\"Around the time Caswell left her job, she landed a spot at the farmer's market in Hammond. Every Friday, she baked 500 cookies with her husband's help to sell at the market on Saturday, and they regularly sold out within 30 minutes, she says.\"That was when I realized, we've got to get in a store. Like, this is not sustainable. We have to find another way to sell,\" Caswell says.The Batter storefront in Hammond, LA.Courtesy of Abi Caswell.It wasn't easy for Caswell to secure a storefront in Hammond. Caswell developed a business plan to open a bakery with the help of her local small business development center, but she had no money saved at the time and several banks rejected her request for a loan.Finally, a bank representative helped her secure a $40,000 loan, for which Caswell says she had to put up her house as collateral, to rent a storefront and install baking appliances. In November 2022, Caswell officially opened her first Batter shop in downtown Hammond with a team of eight employees — a head baker and seven part-time bakery clerks. She had just turned 27 years old.Scaling the businessCaswell was \"running off adrenaline\" for the first few months, she says. She spent up to 18 hours a day working at the bakery to keep up with demand.\"We couldn't keep anything in stock,\" she says. \"We had an amazing time, but it was very, very stressful.\" Batter brought in mid-six figures in its first year of operation, according to Caswell, and she was able to pay off her bank loan entirely by May 2023.After the success of the Hammond location, Caswell opened another Batter location in New Orleans in December 2024 with the goal of reaching a larger customer base.Last year, the two locations collectively brought in seven figures in yearly sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Some of Caswell's cookie creationsCourtesy of Abi CaswellCaswell estimates that she sells over a thousand baked goods each day. Cookies, cupcakes, cakes, petit fours and pull-apart loaves are staples on Batter's menu year-round, she says, but they also offer seasonal treats like a king cake-inspired cookie for Mardi Gras. The bakery's signature chocolate chip cookies cost $3.75 each.Batter also sells cake balls, croissants and homemade pop tarts that Caswell sources from other local women-owned bakeries, and both locations serve coffee.Right now, Caswell is close to achieving a longtime dream: developing her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe into a wholesale mix.She says her first drop of 150 bags of cookie mix, which she sells for $14.99 each, quickly sold out online, and her goal is to get the product into grocery stores this year.\"Before I ever opened Batter, I always said to my husband, 'We're going to be on these shelves one day,'\" she says.Developing a mix will make her cookies \"more accessible,\" rather than being tied to a storefront, Caswell says.'Never truly off the clock'One trait that Caswell believes is crucial to her success is adaptability.\"A lot of being a business owner is what your tolerance level is for your plans to change, for things to pop up and things to go wrong,\" she says.Running both bakeries hasn't been easy – \"every day there's something new going on,\" Caswell says.Caswell currently doesn't have a cake decorator for the New Orleans store, so she's filling the position herself until she can hire a new decorator.Caswell typically splits her time between both stores, which are an hour's drive apart, but since her New Orleans store is understaffed, Caswell has been working at that location \"pretty much full-time\" every day of the week, she says. That's the \"joy of being a small business owner,\" she jokes: you're \"never truly off the clock.\"Caswell holds a bag of her signature chocolate chip cookie mix.Courtesy of Abi CaswellOnline marketing has always been a key element of her business, Caswell says: it's how she reached many of her early customers, and she credits her social media reach for boosting her business to this day.Caswell currently has almost 300,000 followers on her TikTok account, where she posts about her daily routine, shares behind-the-scenes baking videos and opens up about the challenges of running her bakeries.Beyond promoting her bakes, Caswell's goal is to show her audience what it really takes to run a small business.\"I try to be as honest as I can be on social media,\" she says. \"I really think that people don't understand the mental undertaking, but also the time commitment.\" When you own a business, \"there is no real downtime,\" Caswell says. \"Even when I'm on vacation, if the stores are open, I'm on the clock.\"Most of the time, \"the losses hurt more than the wins feel good,\" she continues, but Caswell's goal for this year is to give herself a chance \"to relish what we've done.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and CEO of Ford Jim Farley clap, as President Trump visits a Ford production center, in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersDETROIT — The only consistency has been inconsistency for the U.S. automotive industry during the first half of this decade — a trend that's expected to continue amid challenging market conditions in 2026.The U.S. auto sector — a crucial driver of the economy estimated around 4.8% of America's gross domestic product — has endured rolling crises since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered U.S. assembly plants in early 2020. The global health crisis was followed by yearslong supply chain issues, semiconductor chip shortages, political whipsawing, tariffs and other challenges for all-electric and autonomous vehicles.Automakers have been surprisingly resilient during the challenges, but those issues are now combining with more traditional industry problems of affordability and slowing consumer demand. That's all creating a more challenging environment for automakers in 2026.\"We've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during an interview. \"That's the situation that we're in right now.\"Other executives have expressed similar sentiments as they prepare for a \"new\" U.S. automotive industry: one that's more expensive, smaller and, by many means, less predictable.Automotive forecasters are calling for steady to lower sales this year, despite industry sales only hitting 16.3 million units last year. That was the highest level since the pandemic in 2020, but down from more than 17 million for five consecutive years before the global health crisis, according to industry data.\"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"'Affordability crisis'One of the largest industry issues — and one that's a culmination of many factors — is the affordability of new vehicles. New vehicles prices have climbed; the average transaction price was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.Average transaction prices historically increased on average 3.2% year-over-year, but from 2020-2022 that average nearly tripled to 9%.\"Pandemic-induced production constraints and supply chain chaos didn't just disrupt the market temporarily. They fundamentally restructured pricing dynamics. This elevated plateau is now the new baseline, which has the market anchored at these higher price points,\" said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights.It's not just vehicle prices hitting consumers' wallets either. They're also dealing with inflation, increases in maintenance and repairs, and 13% annual average increases for insurance over the past five years, according to Cox Automotive.\"The cumulative weight of all these increases has pushed total vehicle ownership costs beyond reach for many middle- and lower-income households, constraining market access and accelerating the affordability crisis,\" said Cox Automotive interim chief economist Jeremy Robb. Cox Automotive reports it took 33.7 weeks of median household income to buy the average new vehicle in November 2019. Now it's 36.3 weeks. That's down from a record high of 42.2 weeks during the pandemic, but still means vehicles cost thousands of dollars more than historic levels.David Christ, Toyota Motor's U.S. sales chief, warned that the current tariff and trade environment will cause prices to continue to increase this year, despite the concerns.\"On our end, we're just taking it month-to-month, and we're watching the competitors closely,\" Christ said on a call with reporters earlier this month. \"But we feel prices are going to go up for us and for our competitors.\" To combat the slower sales and affordability challenges, Toyota and other automakers have said they will refocus on lower-priced vehicle models — a change from recent years when automakers prioritized their most expensive, highly profitable vehicles during supply chain shortages.\"Every automaker must face the reality that the American market has changed for the foreseeable future,\" said Lance Woelfer, head of American Honda Motor's U.S. sales.For Honda, Woelfer said that means increasing production on less expensive trims as well as focusing on certified pre-owned vehicles, which are used but backed by company warranties. For others, such as Ford, that could include reentering abandoned segments such as sedans, according to its CEO.\"Never say never,\" Farley told reporters during the event in Detroit. \"The sedan market is very vibrant. It's not that there isn't a market there. It's just we couldn't find a way to compete and be profitable. Well, we may find a way to do that.\"Ford sells sedans outside of the U.S. but exited the domestic market with the cancellation of the Michigan-made Fusion in 2020. It also eliminated the larger Taurus sedan and smaller Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus before that.Ford's crosstown rivals General Motors and Stellantis have largely exited the traditional U.S. sedan market as well.Affordability concerns are generating attention from outside the automotive industry as well. A Senate committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, requested a hearing with CEOs from Ford, GM and Stellantis about affordability and other issues in the automotive industry. The hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 but was postponed amid scheduling conflicts and general pushback from Ford about Tesla CEO Elon Musk not attending the meeting, according to a letter from the company to the subcommittee that was obtained by Politico.2025 Jeep Grand Cherokees are displayed for sale at Larry H. Miller Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram dealership in Thornton, Colorado on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Hyoung Chang | The Denver Post | Getty Images'Prepared for surprises'Automakers are also bracing this year for potentially volatile U.S. regulations and trade negotiations, such as the upcoming renegotiating of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that's scheduled for later this year.Currently, automakers can import new vehicles from South Korea or Japan with lower tariffs than from Canada or Mexico, depending on their U.S. content. The Trump administration has reached trade deals on vehicles with those Asian countries but not its neighbors to the north and south. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, USMCA could be a tailwind for automakers that have a lot of production in the U.S.\"Looking to 2026, our cycle work would suggest that autos would have a difficult time outperforming given a relatively flat y/y volume outlook. However, we see reasons for optimism for US [automakers],\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote last month in an investor note. Wall Street will begin getting its first outlooks from automakers this week beginning with GM announcing its fourth quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month reconfirmed that the automaker expects 2026 will be better than 2025.  GM's 2025 guidance included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.But depending on the automaker, Wall Street analysts expect mixed results for the U.S. industry as it continues to deal with uncertain times.\"It is hard to imagine how 2026 could bring more external shocks and share price divergence than 2025 but, with no visible end to industry disruption, we are also prepared for surprises, impairments and strategic shifts,\" Jefferies analyst Owen Paterson said in an investor note this month.",

    "body": "Mark Carney, Canada's prime minister, after speaking in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCanada has \"no intention\" of pursuing a free trade deal with China, Prime Minister Mark Carney said, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Ottawa.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Carney said that the country respects its obligations under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement, known as CUSMA in Canada and the USMCA in the U.S., and will not pursue a free trade agreement without notifying the other two parties. Carney's remarks come after Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canadian exports if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with Beijing. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.The remarks come against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and Canada, with Trump last week withdrawing the invitation to Ottawa to join his \"Board of Peace,\" after Carney in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos warned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.While Carney did not name any country, Trump said on the sidelines of the WEF that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"    Trump's fiery rhetoric on Truth Social contrasts with what he said after the agreement between Ottawa and Beijing earlier this month, \"that's what he [Carney] should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also echoed Trump's sentiments on Canada and China, telling ABC News on Sunday that the U.S could not \"let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.\"On Jan. 16, Ottawa and Beijing concluded a \"preliminary agreement,\"  with both sides lowering tariffs on select goods. Under the agreement, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the market annually at a lowered tariff rate of 6.1%, after raising tariffs on such vehicles to 100% in October 2024 in conjunction with the U.S. In return, Beijing will cut duties on Canadian agricultural exports, including on canola seed oil, which will see tariffs drop to 15% from March 1, down from the current 85%. Other exports, such as Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will also not be subject to Chinese anti-discrimination tariffs until at least the end of 2026.Carney said Sunday: \"What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that have developed in the last couple of years,\" adding that the deal was \"entirely consistent with CUSMA.\"In August 2025, Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under CUSMA, but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (R) listens as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte speaks during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting on Jan. 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesEurope and U.S. relations are facing their \"lowest moment\" since NATO came into being, former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, as Washington's disruptive approach to diplomacy forces allies to reexamine the transatlantic relationship. \"There are some doubts about the relationship with the United States,\" Barroso, also former prime minister of Portugal, said in an interview with CNBC's \"The China Connection\" on Monday, pointing to a loss of trust that extends beyond the European Union to include the U.K. U.S. President Donald Trump's aim to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, including threats of possible military action and higher tariffs on European nations, has shaken confidence in the U.S. among European leaders and the public. The relationship between Europe and the U.S. has become increasingly driven by interests, shifting away from the traditional model of being based on shared \"democratic values,\" Barroso said, describing the moment as a \"rupture phase\" in which it remains unclear \"where we are going from now.\"While Trump pulled back from a maximalist position, ruling out the use of military force and retreating from his threat of imposing tariffs on European nations aimed at pressuring them to help the U.S. acquire the island, he is sticking with his aim of exerting control on the Arctic territory. In a social media post last week after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said there is \"the framework of a future deal\" on Greenland, without disclosing any details or whether Denmark had agreed to a deal. Rutte later said the issue of Greenland's ownership did not come up in his talks with Trump. Barroso described Trump as \"the great disruptor\" who is sometimes \"more tough with allies and friends, than with opponents.\"  Only 16% of Europeans view the U.S. as an ally that shares the same values, down from 21% in 2024, with a \"striking\" 20% seeing the U.S. as a rival or an enemy, according to a survey conducted in November by the European Council on Foreign Relations, an international think tank. That collapse of trust was stark in the U.K. which saw the share drop to 25%, from 37% a year earlier.   watch nowOn defense, European leaders have also accelerated efforts toward \"European sovereignty,\" Barroso said, as the Trump administration has piled on pressure over the bloc's defense spending. \"If you want to keep NATO, it will be a more Europeanized NATO,\" Barroso said, adding that Europe should not rely only on the Americans, but prioritize strengthening its own defense.   At the NATO Summit in The Hague last year, member states pledged to invest the equivalent of 5% of their economic output on defense and security spending by 2035, following months of pressure from Washington.   Barroso said that NATO was stronger than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pointing to Sweden and Finland joining the bloc and that the alliance is now operationally closer to Russia border. NATO has increased its military presence along its eastern flank following Moscow's invasion in Ukraine. While sounding pessimistic about the current state of Europe-U.S. relations, Barroso cautioned against calling it the end of the transatlantic alliance, saying the U.S. remains crucial to Europe's security.

    "body": "An undated handout image of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by U.S. immigration agents as they tried to detain him in Minneapolis, Minnesota, obtained by Reuters on Jan. 25, 2026.U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs | Via ReutersMajor Minnesota business leaders on Sunday called for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" after federal immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizen Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.More than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies signed a letter urging \"state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.\" The companies said that the recent tumult in Minnesota has caused \"widespread disruption and tragic loss of life.\"Among the signatories to the letter released by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce are incoming Target CEO Michael Fiddelke; William Brown, the chairman and CEO of 3M; Brian Sikes, the chair and CEO of food giant Cargill; and Stephen Hemsley, the CEO of UnitedHealth.\"In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,\" the letter reads. Other signatories include the Minnesota Vikings, Mayo Clinic, General Mills, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Hormel, Medtronic, U.S. Bancorp, and Xcel Energy.The letter did not specifically name President Donald Trump or any other political leader involved with the situation in Minnesota. Executives across the country have been largely reluctant to comment publicly on political issues throughout Trump's second term.It does, however, say that \"representatives of Minnesota's business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state and local officials to advance real solutions.\"\"These efforts have included close communication with the Governor, the White House, the Vice President and local mayors. There are ways for us to come together to foster progress,\" the letter reads. Minnesota is home to 17 Fortune 500 companies, according to the state's government. The state ranks fifth in Fortune 500 concentration per capita. The letter comes one day after federal officers shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis.The Trump administration has surged federal law enforcement to the city to enforce its immigration crackdown and pursue allegations of widespread welfare fraud in the state. Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosPretti's killing is the latest incident in a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration officials that has prompted unrest in the region. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, earlier this month. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has repeatedly called on the Trump administration to withdraw federal law enforcement from the state. The administration has resisted those calls and blamed the state's Democratic leadership for not assisting its efforts. \"President Trump, you can end this today,\" Walz said at a Sunday news conference. \"Pull these folks back, do humane, focused, effective immigration control, you've got the support of all of us to do that.\"Meanwhile, Gregory Bovino, the commander of the Border Patrol operation in Minnesota, doubled down on the federal government's actions. \"Our title eight immigration mission continues unabated here in Minneapolis despite yesterday's tragedy that was preventable by folks making better choices, politicians, journalists and would-be anarchists and rioters,\" Bovino said.This is breaking news.

Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAir travel disruptions will linger into Monday even after a winter storm that forced airlines to cancel more than 15,000 U.S. flights over the weekend clears out.The winter storm is bringing heavy snow, ice, and sleet, followed by bitter cold across much of the country.More than 3,000 flights were canceled for Monday, far fewer than over the weekend but a sign that airlines will need a day to recalibrate after the storm. Over 40% of Monday's departures from New York's LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy Airport, and a third of the schedule of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, were canceled, as were more than 60% of those out of Boston. Only 34 Tuesday flights were canceled thus far, however.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of a major storm to prevent planes, passengers and crew from getting stranded, which can worsen disruptions after severe weather clears. January is a low season for travel but the vast storm was snarling travel across the country for hundreds of thousands of people.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and other U.S. carriers said they are waiving change and cancellation fees as well as fare differences to rebook for customers with tickets to and from more than 40 airports around the country. The waivers include restrictive basic economy tickets. American, JetBlue and Southwest are scheduled to report results this week, and their executives are likely to receive questions from analysts about the impact of the storm on their financial results. The winter storm comes less than a month after airspace was closed over parts of the Caribbean following the U.S. attacks in Venezuela, prompting mass flight cancellations at the end of the holiday season.On Sunday, airlines canceled 11,400 U.S. flights, according to FlightAware, with affected airports stretching from Texas to Maine. A snow removal machine is seen working while an Embraer 175 of United airlines taxies to take off on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesNearly 90% of Sunday flights were canceled at LaGuardia Airport in New York and 99% at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. More than 74% of flights at Newark Liberty International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport, which have more international flights, were also canceled for Sunday.Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines cancelled 1,471 mainline flights on Sunday, close to half of its schedule, while Atlanta-based Delta scrubbed 1,307, or 40%, according to FlightAware. Close to half the flights at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest, were canceled.Even airports out of the storm's path were affected as airlines grounded planes.American said last week that it was repositioning its airplanes and increasing staffing at major airports to help soften the impact of the storm and to \"set the stage for a fast, safe recovery once conditions improve.\"States of emergencyMore than 20 U.S. states were under emergency declarations this weekend due to the massive winter storm.As of 10:05 a.m. ET Sunday, more than 797,000 U.S. customers were without power, with the worst hit areas being Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, according to PowerOutage.com.The Department of Energy issued an emergency order temporarily authorizing grid operator PJM Interconnection to run power generation facilities to help ensure electricity amid extreme temperatures and storm impact across the mid-Atlantic region, though it may exceed environmental permit restrictions.\"As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,\" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.The Department of Energy also authorized the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, to run backup generators for the state.The National Weather Service warned last week that the winter storm could affect hundreds of millions of people and is expected to \"bring widespread heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain from the Southern Rockies to New England through Monday.\"— CNBC's April Roach contributed to this report.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "description": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations",
    "body": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.1. 'They are who they are.'Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.Similar phrases:\"She's always been like that.\"\"I know that's one of his favorite things to do.\"2. 'I'm not surprised at all!'When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Similar phrases: \"Oh yeah, that's my mate alright!\"\"That's totally her style.\"3. 'They're quirky like that.'Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.Similar phrases:\"They sneeze like a train!\"\"His hiccups are kind of adorable.\"4. 'I trust them to be themselves.'Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.Similar phrases:\"She can be a little intense, but I trust her to make good choices.\"\"I know they'll be respectful.\" 5. 'That is a core value.'Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.Similar phrases:\"I know this is really important to them.\"\"He's very passionate about politics.\"6. 'They struggle with that.'Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.Similar phrases:\"I know this is painful for them.\"\"I see her struggle and want to support her through it.\"7. 'I can't change them.'Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.Similar phrases:\"They'll change only if they want to.\"\"I accept that we see this differently, even if I don't like it.\" 8. 'I didn't know that about them!'Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.Similar phrases:\"I never realized they felt that way.\"\"Even though we've been married for years, I'm still learning new things about him.\"Want to get to know your partner better? Here are a few ways to start:Ask open-ended questions with genuine curiosity.Practice seeing situations from their perspective.Speak with respect during difficult conversations.Use physical touch, like hugging or holding hands, to bond.Show presence by putting down your phone, making eye contact and prioritizing time together.The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.Dr. Cortney S.

    "description": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. ",
    "body": "On Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. There's a wide gap between what Americans have seen of the shooting and what federal officials are telling them.Soon after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security officials rushed to defend the officers involved, claiming the victim \"approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun\" and that when federal agents attempted to disarm him, \"the suspect violently resisted.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti, saying in a news conference that the agent fired \"defensive\" shots after the victim violently brandished a gun. \"The officers attempted to disarm this individual, but the armed suspect reacted violently,\" Noem said.In a separate press conference, Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino claimed Pretti may have wanted to do \"maximum damage\" and \"massacre law enforcement.\"But videos taken by bystanders, filmed from several different angles, tell a different story. In the first video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard honking their horns on an urban Minneapolis street, while the video's author records through a car windshield as the car moves.watch nowAt 15 seconds, the camera pans to the left to show a man on the side of the street wearing a brown jacket and tan pants (believed to be Alex Pretti) holding up what appears to be a phone while being confronted by two federal agents. Pretti steps backwards away from the confrontation while appearing to yell at an agent.  At 21 seconds, the person filming the video drives past the confrontation, and the camera swings to the other side of the street as someone in the car yells profanities.  In a second video verified by CNBC, protestors can be heard blowing whistles and honking their horns at federal agents in a video on a cold Minneapolis street. At seven seconds, the video shows a man dressed in tactical gear believed to be a federal agent shove a woman wearing a brown jacket and black leggings in the back near the side of the street. She doesn't fall but moves several feet away because of the shove.  watch nowThe camera briefly shifts to the middle of the street before going back to the confrontation on the side at 11 seconds. The agent is face-to-face with one woman wearing a long cream jacket and charcoal pants. Next to her is a man in a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti, and next to him is the woman in brown jacket, black leggings who was shoved seconds ago.  At 12 seconds in the second video, the agent shoves the woman wearing the cream jacket to the ground. Pretti puts himself between the agent and the woman, who is on her back in a snowbank on the side of the road. At 14 seconds, the agent starts spraying Pretti in the face with a chemical agent. Pretti covers his face and turns away from the officer. Other agents wearing vests approach the confrontation. At 22 seconds, several agents are struggling with Pretti, attempting to bring him to the ground. He appears to fall to the ground, and at 28 seconds you see one agent apparently swinging a punch at his head while Pretti is down.  At this point, bystanders are recording, and whistles are making noise constantly. By 38 seconds, at least six agents seem to have restrained the man believed to be Pretti on the ground.One agent appears to take a weapon from Pretti and quickly walks away while holding the gun. A gunshot is heard at 40 seconds. It is unclear if the man holding the gun fired the shot. Following the first shot, more gunshots are heard in quick succession.  In a third video verified by CNBC, taken by someone on the street near the incident, protestors are blowing whistles at federal agents. watch nowAt 25 seconds, a man wearing a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti is holding his hand up in the middle of the street. He waves a car past and then starts walking. The camera then shifts away for a moment to a snowbank. A protestor can be heard shouting, \"What is wrong with you?\" At 33 seconds into the third video, Pretti has his arm around a woman in a dark green jacket and black leggings, apparently attempting to help her. He steps in front of a federal agent closing in on a woman who is on her back in the snowbank on the side of the road.  At 40 seconds, Pretti has his hand up to a federal agent who is spraying him with some kind of chemical agent. Two agents drag him onto his back and more agents join in a circle around the man in tan pants. A struggle takes place on the ground, with six agents surrounding the man in tan pants. At 60 seconds, one of the agents can be seen stepping back from the confrontation and he draws his gun and points it at Pretti. At 1:01, a single shot can be heard, followed by several in quick succession. The man on the ground, Pretti, slumps down.Amid screams, at 1:04, another flurry of gunshots can be heard.At no point in any of the three videos shown here does Alex Pretti brandish a weapon or appear to threaten federal immigration agents before the confrontation begins, as was claimed by DHS Sec. Noem and others in the Trump administration. One video also appears to show a federal officer removing a weapon from Pretti while he's being restrained by agents on the ground before any shots are fired. Pretti is a lawful gun owner and owns a permit for his weapon.",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "watch nowSoon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. For starters, babies born in 2025 through 2028 may receive a one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements, and all U.S. families are eligible for the initial seed money. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children.

Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a \"50-state challenge,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. How to set up a Trump accountTrump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed in July.To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. The form also includes a check box for the $1,000 Treasury contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028.   Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov.Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027.As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.How much a Trump account may be worthExperts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. For example, let's say a family receives $1,000 from the Treasury and a $1,000 matching contribution from their employer for a total of $2,000 during their baby's first year.That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Many experts encourage families to accept \"free money\" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

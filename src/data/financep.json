    "body": "If you don't have children and don't plan on having any, many of the \"default\" settings of personal finance may not apply to you. You may not, for instance, plan on leaving legacy wealth, as many parents do, and you certainly don't have to worry about paying for a kid's wedding or college education.But who will take care of you or make decisions on your behalf in the event that you can't make them for yourself? For many Americans, the default answer is, \"my kids.\"If something bad happens and you don't have children who will take care of you, things can get complicated quickly, says Maddy Roche, chief growth officer at Childfree Trust, a fiduciary firm specializing in childfree and permanently childless people.\"Think about some of the structures that assume that you have children, whether it be insurance planning, estate planning, medical relationships,\" she says. \"You can't get an elective surgery unless you have an emergency contact. Those are the things that we run up against when time's too late.\"The solution, she says, is to start thinking about these scenarios early. \"As hard as it is to think about the future, one of the best ways to ensure that you'll be respected in the ways that you crave and deserve is to be proactive,\" she says.Be proactive in your planningJust about every financial professional will tell you that everyone — whether you have kids or not — needs some form of an estate plan, which expresses how you'd like medical and financial decisions to be carried out in the event of your death or incapacitation.This becomes even more important for people whose family strays from the norm, Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner specializing in childfree clients, previously told CNBC Make It.Because health care and government systems look for next-of-kin, there may be no one obvious to contact in the event you get into an accident while out of town, for instance, he says: \"That means the government or health-care system will be making decisions for you.\"To avoid those scenarios, you'll need documents in place, such as powers of attorney and a health-care directive. These documents go by different names in different states, so talk with an attorney about your specific needs, but the gist is that they lay out your wishes and designate a decision-maker for you should you become incapacitated.These wishes could be as consequential as whether or not you want to be on a respirator or as straightforward as what to do with your cats while you're in the hospital.Designate a trusted friend or relativeFor many childfree people, figuring out who will execute your plan comes with some complications. You may, for instance, want to nominate an extended family member to oversee your care — but that could create conflicts of interest if that person stands to inherit your estate.\"Some people feel like they need to offer monetary compensation for these roles. Say, for instance, you have a long-lost nephew,\" she says. \"Are we sure he won't feel conflicted in terms of helping you manage your affairs — that you'll stay in the kind of quality facility you need if he feels his inheritance is on the line?\"In some states, you may be able to hire a fiduciary to execute your estate — someone who is bound by law to act in your best financial interest. For the most part, though, you'll have to cultivate what Roche calls a \"strategic relationship\" with a trusted friend or relative.The key, she says, is to make sure you're on the same page as early as possible.\"You need to start to think about your wishes and make sure they're documented and make sure the people you're nominating really know what you want to happen,\" Roche says. \"Talk with people about what these roles are and what you expect of them. It's all important to be thinking about.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Lisa Cook speaks on \"The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\" at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 3, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in her first policy speech since President Donald Trump tried to remove her from office, said Monday that she supported the recent interest rate reduction and indicated she would be open to more.Since Trump made his move in August to sack Cook on accusations of mortgage fraud, she has kept a relatively low profile outside of the court battles that have kept her in her position at the central bank.In remarks before the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., the policymaker laid out her views on the economy and where she thinks monetary policy should land. Generally, she sees the economy as solid with risks to both the Fed's goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.Cook said she sided with the 10-2 vote on the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the second meeting in a row that saw a cut.\"I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization,\" she said.Trump has been blocked by courts from removing Cook in what has been seen as a pivotal issue for central bank independence. Though White House officials have said Cook lied in forms she filled out for federally guaranteed home mortgages, she has not been convicted of anything nor have any charges even been brought. Cook has cited \"clerical errors\" in the loan applications. She declined to comment on the matter during a question-and-answer session, saying \"it would be inappropriate\" while noting she is \"beyond grateful\" for the support she has received.In the meantime, she has continued her duties at the Fed, which lowered its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December.As for the path going forward, Cook said she is sticking with a data-dependent position. FOMC officials in September indicated an additional cut is likely before the end of the year.\"As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks,\" she said. \"Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\"\"Certainly we want to see if tariff effects are persistent, to see if firms are waiting to raise prices, to see what they've done with inventory,\" she added. \"So there's a lot to look at. There's a lot to anticipate with the December meeting coming up.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets during his Wednesday post-meeting news conference when he said the December cut is not a sure thing. Powell noted a wide dispersion of opinions on the committee, known more often for its consensus approach to policy.\"Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,\" Cook said, using what has become boilerplate language for Fed officials. \"We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated.\"On inflation, she said Trump's tariffs have not fully made their way through the economy. However, she said the most likely outcome is a \"one-time increase\" in prices not likely to fuel inflation over the longer term.",

    "body": "Feeling financially unsafe in a relationship can happen to anyone, even billionaires.Kim Kardashian said her ex-husband Kanye West's unpredictable spending habits — including suddenly purchasing and giving away multiple Lamborghinis at a time — contributed to her decision to end the marriage in 2021, she told host Alex Cooper in an October episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast.\"Not feeling safe, not even physically, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" Kardashian said. \"That's a really unsettling feeling.\"Whether it's to pay bills or afford housing and food, we need money in life — which is why a lack of financial safety, or financial insecurity, is scary for most people, says Erika Wasserman, a financial therapist and CEO of Your Financial Therapist based in Parkland, Florida.The average person's unpredictable spending habits may not involve purchasing five Lamborghinis at a time, Wasserman says, but it can look like impulsively buying five Lego sets or taking out a new line of credit. Any situation where you don't see eye to eye with a partner you share finances with has the possibility of causing a significant amount of strain, she says.\"When you can't trust the partner that you're with on how you're spending, saving and investing money, you become scared and fearful,\" Wasserman says. \"Then, it rolls into other aspects of your relationship.\"Financial intimacy can make or break your relationshipFinancial intimacy should be just as important as emotional or sexual intimacy in a relationship, yet people often skip talking about their finances because it's taboo or uncomfortable, Wasserman says.An October study by business software company Intuit found that 37% of U.S. consumers start sharing their salaries around the time they decide to exclusively date their partner. Wasserman says this isn't enough: More people should talk about their finances when committing to serious relationships.Our financial habits impact everything in life. While money isn't why most couples fall in love, once the initial spark fades, financial behaviors can make or break a relationship, Wasserman says.If couples disagree and \"there's no habit changing or plans in place, the spread tends to get bigger,\" Wasserman says. \"That's where you see relationships start splitting apart.\"The No. 1 red flag to look out forWasserman says the biggest red flag to watch for when determining whether you can align financially with a partner is stonewalling. Someone who avoids conversations about money or hides their spending early in a relationship will likely continue that behavior as things progress, she says.\"If you're both willing to work on [financial intimacy], then there's hope for the relationship,\" Wasserman says. \"But if one person's checked out, it doesn't work in any part of your relationship — with sex, with religion, with money. If you're both not willing to work on it and be open, then it's time to evaluate the relationship.\"Foster financial intimacy through storytellingWhen building financial intimacy and safety, focus on sharing your financial habits through storytelling, like sharing how often you went out to eat as a kid or your experiences grocery shopping with your parents. Direct questions about financial habits \"tend to put people on guard,\" Wasserman says.If you do need to be direct, which Wasserman says can be important and appropriate at times, do it with \"compassion and empathy.\" Understand that your partner may have a different background than you, and that can shape how they view conversations around money.Ultimately, the best thing you can do to set yourself up for success is to just \"start the conversation,\" Wasserman says. \"Financial intimacy takes time. It's grown together. It's open conversations. It's being vulnerable.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway may have quietly trimmed its massive Apple stake again in the third quarter, a new regulatory filing suggests.In its latest quarterly report, Berkshire said the cost basis of its consumer products equity holdings fell by roughly $1.2 billion from the prior quarter. That category is dominated by the giant conglomerate's Apple position, implying the decline likely reflects additional sales of Apple shares.Apple's stock jumped more than 24% in the third quarter, a rally that would have offered Buffett an attractive opportunity to take profits.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconApple year to dateBuffett went on a head-turning selling spree in Apple in 2024, slashing two-thirds of the shares Berkshire held in a surprising move for the famously long-term-focused investor. Berkshire also trimmed its Apple stake in the second quarter of this year. The iPhone maker was still Berkshire's largest holding at the end of June, when it controlled 280 million shares worth $57 billion.Investors will get more clarity about the exact size of Berkshire's Apple position when it releases its detailed 13F filing it makes to the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month. That will disclose any changes to individual stock holdings through Sept. 30.Buffett had previously hinted that selling down the Apple stake was for tax reasons, but others speculated that the size of the sales suggested the so-called Oracle of Omaha was also concerned about Apple's high valuation. Some thought it was also part of portfolio management, as the Apple stake had grown so big that at one time it accounted for more than half of Berkshire's investment portfolio.Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters, raising more than $6 billion in cash in the third quarter. Buffett's one-time favorite yardstick for stock market valuations, which measures the total value of all publicly traded U.S. stocks against the entire gross national product of the United States, has climbed to an all-time high, reaching a level that he once described as \"playing with fire.\"",

The news agency reported that people were injured or died after becoming trapped in Tesla vehicles after collisions or battery power losses that prevented doors from opening normally.Tesla design leader Franz Von Holzhausen has said in subsequent press interviews that the company would change the design of its door handles.Tesla competitors, including Rivian, are also reconsidering flush-mounted, or retractable door handle designs.Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer recently said his company's customers don't even want the flush-mounted, electronic doorhandles and VW has no plans to adopt them.Meanwhile, China is expected to implement new vehicle safety standards around door handles, including a requirement to have more clearly marked, accessible and easier-to-use emergency, interior door release mechanisms.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released draft standards and comments are open through November 22.The NHTSA Tesla probe seeks records concerning all model year, \"2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale or lease in the United States,\" as well as \"peer vehicles,\" including Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from model years 2017 to 2022, and \"systems related to opening doors including, door handles, door latches, 12VDC batteries, software,\" and other components.Tesla has until Dec. 10 to provide the records.While Tesla can seek an extension on the deadline from NHTSA, it may face fines of \"$27,874 per violation per day, with a maximum of $139,356,994\" if the company either fails to or refuses to \"respond completely, accurately, or in a timely manner\" to NHTSA's information requests, the agency cautioned in its letter.",

Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told a Rhode Island federal judge on Monday that it would tap billions of dollars in contingency funds to pay 50% of the normal amount of SNAP benefits in November as the U.S. government shutdown persists.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to about 42 million low-income Americans.The administration in a court filing told Judge Jack McConnell that it had declined the option he suggested to make full November payments for SNAP benefits by using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as from other unspecified funds.Instead, the administration will use all of the $4.65 billion remaining from a contingency fund for SNAP appropriated by Congress for \"November benefits that will be obligated to cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments.\"McConnell, in a ruling on Friday, said the administration could not cease paying SNAP benefits. Before his order, the administration had rejected the idea of using the contingency funds in the face of the shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Prior presidential administrations, including the first one of President Donald Trump, have used contingency funds to continue paying SNAP benefits during government shutdowns.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on October 31, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesIt is not clear when the benefits will begin being paid out by individual states. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said that the benefits might be paid by Wednesday.In its filing Monday, the administration said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture \"will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for States to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that State.\"USDA authorized the states to begin disbursing the benefits once the table is issued.Democracy Forward, the advocacy group whose lawyers represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to McConnell's order, criticized the administration for not making full SNAP benefits payments by Monday.\"We are reviewing the administration's submission to the court and considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds,\" said Democracy Forward CEO Skye Perryman in a statement.\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our President to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided,\" Perryman said. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, in a statement, said, \"The Trump Administration just admitted what we have known all along – this funding was available this entire time and the President could have been using it to prevent American families from going hungry.\"\"We are awaiting clarity on how much and when those benefits will be made available. But the President should not stop there,\" Healey said.

    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2022.Benoit Tessier | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said he knows nothing about Binance founder Changpeng Zhao — or that company's recent involvement in a cryptocurrency venture linked to Trump's family — despite granting him a pardon last month.Asked in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday why he pardoned the former crypto executive known as CZ, Trump said: \"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is.\"In late 2023, Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance and pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to sufficiently combat money laundering on his crypto exchange. He was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.Trump suggested that his decision to pardon CZ was motivated by a desire to make the U.S. more globally competitive in the nascent crypto industry. And he accused the government under his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, of waging a \"witch hunt\" against CZ, even as Trump repeatedly denied knowledge of his case.\"My sons are involved in crypto much more than I— me. I— I know very little about it, other than one thing. It's a huge industry,\" he said. \"And if we're not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is.\"Despite saying he didn't know who CZ is, Trump said Zhao \"was treated really badly by the Biden administration.\"\"They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That's my opinion. I was told about it,\" the president said.\"I don't know the man at all. I don't think I ever met him,\" Trump went on. \"I have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\"Trump's claim that he knows nothing about a high-profile clemency recipient comes as he and Republicans have asserted that pardons issued by Biden using an \"autopen\" are invalid because, they contend, the president was not aware of what he was signing.Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in March that many of Biden's pardons are void \"because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\"After Republicans on the Oversight Committee issued a report last month on Biden's autopen use, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the former president \"didn't even know what the categories were, apparently, much less the individual people, that he pardoned.\"Binance in 2023 agreed to pay a total of $4.3 billion to settle a multiyear investigation into allegations that the platform's users had made thousands of transactions in support of illicit activities, including terrorism and child abuse.Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland called that fine \"one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.\"Following Trump's election, Zhao mounted an aggressive campaign for clemency, including publicly praising the president and submitting pardon applications, The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysBinance also recently became financially entangled with World Liberty Financial, a crypto finance platform that sends 75% of token sales revenue to a company linked to Trump and his family.In May, World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff — a son of top Trump administration official Steve Witkoff — said his company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.Later that same month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it would drop its case against Binance and Zhao.The president announced Zhao's pardon on Oct. 23.Trump was asked in Sunday's CBS interview to address \"the appearance of pay for play.\"\"Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy,\" Trump said before a moment of crosstalk.\"I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government,\" he said.Returning to CZ, Trump said: \"I know nothing about the guy, other than I hear he was a victim of weaponization by government. When you say the government, you're talking about the Biden government.\"",

    "body": "Ford Mustang Mach-E EV vehicles at a Ford dealership in Los Angeles, California, US, on Thursday, Oct 16, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Sales of all-electric vehicles collapsed last month following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for purchasing an EV, several automakers said Monday.Ford Motor, Kia, Hyundai Motor and Toyota Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% decline for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.Toyota reported it sold 18 units of its sole all-electric vehicle, named the BZ, in October. That was down from 1,401 units a year earlier and 61 vehicles the month before.Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month to month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, fell by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for comparable vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.\"While the expiration of the federal tax credit impacted EV sales in the month of October, we still saw strong demand leading up to that change, and we remain confident that the market is going to reset,\" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during a Monday interview.Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.Parker said Hyundai's hybrid sales surged 41% last month compared with October 2024, leading its total \"electrified\" vehicle sales, which include EVs, to be up 8%. Pure EV sales, the company said, were down 57% last month compared to October 2024, after a 157% year-over-year increase in September.Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.\"With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. \"October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.\"Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop-off in EV sales.Farley late last month said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if sales of EVs fell to a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.Tesla, at a 43.1% market share, and General Motors, at 13.8%, led the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles through the third quarter, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book estimates EV sales volume in the U.S. hit an all-time high in the third quarter, reaching 438,487 units sold. That marked a 40.7% jump from the previous quarter and an increase of 29.6% year over year.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the description of remarks from Farley.",

Santiago | Getty ImagesNew York Attorney General Letitia James and more than a dozen other state attorneys general on Monday sued the Trump administration over its new rule limiting eligibility for a popular student loan forgiveness program.The AGs' lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court, was prompted by the U.S. Department of Education's final rule released last week. The rule changes the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude certain organizations \"that engage in unlawful activities\" such as \"supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration,\" according to an Education Department statement.PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government.\"Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created as a promise to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and social workers that their service to our communities would be honored,\" said Attorney General James in a statement.\"Instead, this administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,\" James said.In an email to CNBC, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the rule \"commonsense reform.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStates sue Trump over rule limiting student loan forgiveness for public servantsHow to navigate open enrollment as health insurance premiums increaseMany mutual fund strategies are launching as ETFs: What it means for investorsThese inherited IRA mistakes could reduce your windfall, advisors sayLayoffs are mounting, making it a 'challenging time to be unemployed': expertWhy travel insurance may not protect you in the government shutdownStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedMore than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans.President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness efforts, which included making it easier to qualify for PSLF. Under President Joe Biden, more than 1 million people had their debts cleared under the program, according to a 2024 White House fact sheet.The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.A coalition of cities across the U.S, labor unions and nonprofit organizations also filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its PSLF rule.\"The Trump Administration's illegal actions threaten to make higher education even more expensive for Boston's teachers, first responders, and civil servants,\" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement.",

    "body": "Huggies, manufactured by Kimberly-Clark and Band-Aid, manufactured by Kenvue.Getty ImagesKimberly-Clark announced Monday it's struck an agreement to buy Kenvue in a deal valued at $48.7 billion that would create a consumer staples giant.The deal is a combination of cash and stock and totals about $40 billion on an equity basis, excluding the impact of debt. Shares of Kenvue surged 15% Monday, while Kimberly-Clark stock fell 13%.The combined company would bring together brands like Huggies and Kleenex with the likes of Band-Aid and Tylenol. It would include 10 billion-dollar brands, the companies said in a news release. The acquisition would be one of the largest on Wall Street this year.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026.Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu said in a statement that the companies share a \"commitment to developing science and technology to provide extraordinary care.\"\"Over the last several years, Kimberly-Clark has undertaken a significant transformation to pivot our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin businesses while rewiring our organization to work smarter and faster,\" Hsu said. \"We have built the foundation and this transaction is a powerful next step in our journey.\"Kenvue, a portfolio of consumer health brands, spun out of Johnson & Johnson in May 2023, marking the biggest shake-up in J&J's nearly 140-year history. Since then, Kenvue shares have fallen almost 35% from their initial public offering price. As of Friday's close, Kenvue traded at about $14 per share for a market cap of roughly $27 billion.J&J has sold all of its remaining stake in the consumer goods giant.watch nowThe deal comes just weeks after President Donald Trump made unfounded claims linking the use of acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism, sending Kenvue's stock sharply lower. The company has staunchly pushed back against his administration's accusation, and many medical experts say Tylenol is often the safest and only option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women.Acetaminophen is used by upward of 100 million Americans annually.Kenvue Chair Larry Merlo said in a statement that following a comprehensive strategic review, the board is \"confident this combination represents the best path forward for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.\"Three Kenvue board members will join the Kimberly-Clark board upon the deal's closing. Hsu will continue to serve as chairman and CEO.The combined company would generate estimated 2025 annual net revenue of roughly $32 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $7 billion, according to the release.Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue expect about $1.9 billion in cost synergies from the transaction to be realized in the first three years following the deal's close.The acquisition comes as Kimberly-Clark and the broader consumer packaged goods industry try to address shifting demand and shopping behavior, often through deal-making and divestitures.Tariffs imposed by Trump's administration have challenged the industry and its profits as key commodities like pulp, which is used to make tissues and diapers, grow more expensive.At the beginning of 2025, Kimberly-Clark stopped making private-label diapers for Costco to focus on more premium brands that command higher margins.In June, the company sold a majority stake in its international tissue business to Brazilian pulp maker Suzano. The resulting joint venture is intended to shield Kimberly-Clark from volatile input costs and help stabilize its margins.Once the deal closes, Kimberly-Clark will own health-care brands like Sudafed and Pepcid, once again pitting the company against rival Procter & Gamble, which has a health-care division that includes Pepto-Bismol and Vicks.But even with Kimberly-Clark's blockbuster acquisition, P&G still dwarfs its rival in both enterprise value and annual revenue. P&G has a market cap of about $350 billion.Similar to Kenvue, other spinoffs have also recently proven to be popular acquisition targets. Last year, candy maker Mars announced plans to buy Kellanova, a snacking-centric spinoff of Kellogg, while Ferrero bought W.K. Kellogg, the cereal stand-alone, this year.",

    "body": "A Beyond Meat Burger is seen on display at a store in Port Washington, New York, U.S., June 3, 2019. Picture taken June 3, 2019. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersShares of Beyond Meat fell Monday after the company delayed its third-quarter financial results.The plant-based meat maker will now report earnings after the market closes on Nov. 11. Beyond Meat said it delayed its results because it needs more time to calculate a material noncash impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets.Beyond Meat had become a meme stock in October, rising from a sub-$2 price to nearly $8 at one point as traders on Robinhood and other brokerages crowded in to the stock following its addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and in order to possibly exploit a large short position by hedge funds.The shares were off by more than 11% to $1.47, below its $1.89 close to end September.",

    "body": "A Pfizer logo is displayed at a research facility in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, U.S., Sept. 30, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersPfizer on Monday said it filed a second lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera, alleging that the Danish drugmaker's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire the obesity biotech is anticompetitive. Pfizer alleges that Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk's proposed acquisition of Metsera would help it maintain its dominant position in the blockbuster obesity market by eliminating a smaller potential competitor, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court in Delaware. The suit also alleges that Metsera's controlling shareholders conspired with the obesity biotech and Novo Nordisk. In a statement on Monday, Ambre James Brown, Novo Nordisk's vice president of global media, said \"Pfizer's baseless claims that Novo Nordisk intends to suppress innovation through our offer is false and without merit.\" \"Instead of competing on price, Pfizer has taken the highly unusual and seemingly desperate approach in filing its antitrust lawsuit today,\" Brown said. She added that Novo Nordisk's offer, including the structure of the transaction, complies with all applicable laws and is in the \"best interest\" of patients and Metsera shareholders. In a statement, Metsera said, \"Pfizer is trying to litigate its way to buying Metsera for a lower price than Novo Nordisk.\" The company added that Pfizer's litigation arguments \"are nonsense, and Metsera will address them in court.\"The new suit escalates a heated standoff between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over Metsera, whose obesity pipeline could yield new competitors in the booming weight loss drug market. Pfizer in September said that it would acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, or up to $7.3 billion with future payments – a deal that could be the company's golden ticket to enter the space after struggling to bring its own obesity products to market. But Novo Nordisk on Thursday launched a takeover bid valuing the biotech at around $6 billion, triggering a deadline of four business days for Pfizer to renegotiate its offer. On Friday, Pfizer filed its first lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera seeking to block the biotech from terminating its existing merger deal with Pfizer. That suit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, alleges that Novo Nordisk's offer can't qualify as a superior proposal because it's not reasonably likely to be completed due to its significant regulatory risk.Novo Nordisk helped establish the weight loss drug space, bringing to market highly effective GLP-1 drugs, including the diabetes injection Ozempic and obesity shot Wegovy. But the company has lost its leading position in the market to its chief rival, Eli Lilly, over the last year and has struggled to impress investors with its pipeline. ",

    "body": "A Taco Bell restaurant in El Cerrito, California, US, on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith more consumer companies preparing to report third-quarter earnings this week, Wall Street will be watching for signs of a bifurcated or \"K-shaped\" economy as consumers diverge in their spending behaviors.There have been increasing signals that wealthier Americans are spending more while lower-income Americans are significantly paring back their spending. Lower-income consumers have been hit hardest by rising inflation and escalating prices on essentials, with September's consumer price index report indicating a 0.3% increase on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%.Shortly after the CPI report was released, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its second straight interest rate cut, lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%.Meanwhile, the country is entering the fifth week of the government shutdown, with many federal workers going without pay.The Census Bureau estimated there were 35.9 million people in poverty in 2024, the most recent available data, with the weighted average poverty threshold for a family of four coming in at $32,130. The median household income, meanwhile was $83,730 last year, according to the bureau.The top 10% of households saw their income increase 4.2% between 2023 and 2024, but there was no meaningful change for the bottom 10% of households, the bureau said in September. There were approximately 33 million households in the top 10% of earners and another 33 million in the bottom 10% of earners as of last year.Consumers with the highest purchasing power have benefited from stock market rallies and rising home values. Data from JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey found that higher-income consumers reported stronger economic confidence readings for the next year.Recent earnings reports from companies touching all corners of the economy have indicated the K-shaped trend is beginning to take hold. This week, companies like Yum Brands, McDonald's, E.l.f. Beauty, Tapestry and Under Armour are preparing to release quarterly earnings reports and could report similar trends.Last week, Chipotle reported it's seeing consumers who make less than $100,000 a year, which represents roughly 40% of the company's customer base, spending less frequently due to concerns about the economy and inflation. CEO Scott Boatwright said the company is seeing \"consistent macroeconomic pressures\" with a 0.8% decline in traffic for the quarter.Coca-Cola said in its third-quarter earnings that pricier products like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes are driving its growth. Procter & Gamble reported similar results, saying wealthier customers are buying more from club retailers, which sell bigger pack sizes, while lower-income shoppers are significantly pulling back.And some of the companies reporting this week have already indicated they may be seeing similar behaviors. In early September, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that the chain's expansion of its value menu was due to a \"two-tier economy.\"watch now\"Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits, and it's because people are either choosing to skip a meal ... or they're choosing to just eat at home,\" he said.The trend isn't limited to just food and beverage, either. In the autos world, consumers who can afford to buy new vehicles are on a spree, while those who are more price constrained are sitting out. Defaults and repossessions are on the rise while the average price for a new vehicle is setting records.And in the service industry, Hilton earlier this month reported that it saw a drop in revenue for its affordable brands while its luxury offerings performed exceedingly well. Still, CEO Christopher Nassetta told CNBC last month that he doesn't expect bifurcation to last much longer.\"My own belief is that as we look into the fourth quarter and particularly into next year, we're going to see a very big shift in those dynamics, meaning, I don't think you're going to continue to have this bifurcation,\" Nassetta said. \"That's not to say I think the high end is going to get worse or bad. I just think the middle and the low end [are] going to move up.\"Correction: This article has been updated to correct the month of the CPI report.",

    "body": "Automaker Stellantis is making $13 billion bet on a U.S. comeback, after a rough 2024 and a $2.7 billion net loss in the first half of 2025.High prices and stale products scuttled what had been a highly successful first few years of the combined company. Stellantis was the product of a merger of French company Peugeot and Italian American company Fiat-Chrysler. Joining forces allowed the automakers to save more than $8 billion through sharing parts and streamlining operations, roughly double what the deal had promised investors.Pandemic-era shortages also allowed Stellantis raise prices on the vehicles it could sell when inventories were tight. The result was three years of growing profits — from $15.4 billion in 2021 to $20 billion in 2023.But even though inventory shortages across the industry kept sales strong, many of the core buyers of Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler were turning away.\"A lot of automakers during the pandemic really raised pricing,\" said Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital. \"But they [Stellantis] actually were among the worst offenders.\"During that time, Stellantis was losing market share — dropping about 5% U.S. market share in about five years, according to Autoforecast Solutions.Stellantis has a new plan that aims to recapture its previous status with its $13 billion investment.About a tenth of that is so far dedicated to tooling up U.S. factories for new and existing models. That's also a sign that the company is trying to escape costs associated with tariffs on imported vehicles, experts said. Stellantis earlier this year said trade barriers stand to cost it $1.7 billion in 2025.Watch the video to learn more.",

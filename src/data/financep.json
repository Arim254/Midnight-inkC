    "body": "The Etsy NYC headquarters building is seen in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesEtsy CEO Josh Silverman will step down from his position and move to the role of executive chairman at the end of the year, the online marketplace said Wednesday.Kruti Patel Goyal, the CEO of Etsy-owned clothing resale app Depop, will take the helm at Etsy effective Jan. 1, 2026, the company said. Etsy shares fell more than 9% in premarket trading following the news, which was announced alongside the company's third-quarter earnings report. Silverman, a former eBay executive, held the top job for the last eight years and guided the company through a demand surge brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, when shoppers flocked to the site to buy up face masks. Etsy has struggled to grow its business since the pandemic e-commerce boom, while it continues to contend with stiff competition from Amazon and Shopify, as well as China-linked upstarts Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.This is breaking news.

    "body": "A 'For Sale' sign is posted beside property for sale in Alhambra, California.Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped for the fourth straight week last week, spurring both current homeowners and potential homebuyers to call their lenders. Total mortgage application volume increased 7.1% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.30% from 6.37%, with points falling to 0.58 from 0.59, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest level since September 2024.Refinance demand, which is most sensitive to interest rate changes, jumped 9% for the week and was 111% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, the average rate on the 30-year fixed was 43 basis points higher.\"This recent decline in rates spurred the second consecutive week of increased refinance activity, driven mainly by conventional refinance applications,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. \"The ARM [adjustable-rate mortgage] share of applications, which had been trending higher, dipped below 10 percent last week, as lower rates prompted more borrowers to choose fixed rate loans.\"Kan also noted that the average loan size of a refinance application remained elevated at $393,900, as borrowers with larger loans can see more savings on a refinance.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 5% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago. Homebuyers are still facing high prices and increasing uncertainty on the economy.\"Purchase applications increased compared to a holiday-shortened week across most loan types. However, USDA applications fell more than 26 percent, impacted by the ongoing government shutdown,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates dropped even more to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The markets, however, with very little government data to go on due to the shutdown, are focused even more intently than usual on Wednesday's announcement and news conference from the Federal Reserve on interest rates.\"We already know the Fed will be cutting rates, and that rate cut has no bearing on what happens to mortgage rates going forward,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"Rather, it would be the tone of the Fed's press conference, or the nature of any changes in the Fed's bond buying policies (something that might be included in [the] statement).\"",

    "body": "The Lucid display is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCLucid Group is targeting a new goal that would make it the first automaker to offer highly advanced self-driving capabilities in its vehicles in the coming years, the company said Tuesday.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer expects to launch what it's calling \"mind-off\" driving in which a car can essentially drive itself under normal circumstances without a human needing to monitor it or intervene unless there's a change in circumstances, such as severe weather. That would be like an occupant playing a game of cards or watching TV while the car is driving.Lucid on Tuesday said it plans to leverage Nvidia's \"Drive AV\" platform and multisensor suite that includes cameras, radar, and lidar — or light detection and sensing, which allows the vehicle to better \"see\" its surroundings — for the forthcoming system.Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, said the plan is to debut the new system \"definitely in the coming years,\" but he declined to specify an exact timeframe other than it won't be in 2026. The system is first planned for Lucid's upcoming midsize vehicle before it would expand to other models, he said.\"I want to make sure that we can offer this for our customers in a timeframe that I think is very ambitious, but at the same time, also we're realistic,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"The main reason why I decided to not start from scratch, just do it ourselves, it's simply time to market. … Also, it would cost a lot of money.\"Winterhoff said Nvidia's technologies will be a catalyst for the system, while Lucid plans to actually execute the self-driving technology.In the meantime, Winterhoff said Lucid plans to continue to increase the automated technologies on its current vehicles — the Air sedan and Gravity SUV — in partnership with Nvidia.A Lucid-supplied teaser image of its upcoming midsize vehicle behind its current Gravity SUV.Lucid\"It will be a stepping stone,\" said Winterhoff, who has served as interim CEO since company founder Peter Rawlinson left as chief executive in February.Many companies, including General Motors and Tesla, have promised personal self-driving vehicles but have failed to deliver. Automakers have invested billions of dollars working on autonomous vehicles in recent years, with most pulling back spending after years of trying to deploy the technologies.What Lucid is aiming to launch is what the industry refers to as \"Level 4: High Driving Automation.\" As defined by SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 4 technologies should not require monitoring or human intervention under certain, but not all, conditions.There are a limited number of Level 4 vehicles currently on U.S. roadways. Most notably, Alphabet's Waymo operates robotaxis in a variety of cities. Lucid is saying it plans to be the first for a consumer vehicle.Achieving such a system for Lucid will be daunting, especially given its track record on advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS.The company, by its own admission, has not lived up to its customers' expectations. It has been slow to release systems capable of hands-free driving, like many companies offer, or compete with well-known \"Level 2\" technologies such as GM's \"Super Cruise\" or Tesla's \"Autopilot\" or \"FSD.\"Meanwhile, it's set to be a record year for EV sales, but demand for all-electric cars is expected to decline with the end of federal incentives of up to $7,500.Lucid announced the self-driving technology plans as well as other initiatives in conjunction with the Nvidia GTC global artificial intelligence conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C.",

Brian Snyder | ReutersA group of more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to maintain funding of so-called SNAP benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown.The suit was filed four days after the Trump administration said it would not use $6 billion in Congressionally-appropriated emergency funding to maintain benefits during the shutdown from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which blames Senate Democrats for not ending the shutdown, has said that SNAP benefits will cease on Saturday, the lawsuit noted.\"Because of USDA's actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program's inception,\" the suit says.\"Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,\" the states said in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, one of the states in the case, at a press conference accused the Trump administration of \"playing fast and loose with people eating. Can you imagine that?\"\"The money is there! Let us not let them get away with saying that they can't do it,\" DeLauro said. \"Their political will isn't there to feed the people who rely on the SNAP program, which is the most effective anti-hunger program in the United States of America.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteNew York State Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on the suit, said, \"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide.\"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,\" James said. \"There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"A USDA spokesperson, asked for comment on the suit, said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"\"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, in an interview on Tuesday on Fox News shortly after the suit was filed, was asked if funding for SNAP had \"truly run dry.\"\"100% unequivocally, USDA does not have the $9.2 billion that it would require,\" Rollins answered.\"There's not just pots of $9.2 billion sitting around. And what's particularly rich about New York saying that, or California, or any of these other blue states that have filed the lawsuit to say, 'Oh no, we're going to go, you guys, USDA, go find the money,' \" Rollins said.\"It's their very friends, partners, colleagues, Democrat elected officials, that continue to vote over and over again to keep the government closed,\" Rollins said.\"Again, shame on them. I cannot begin to understand what they're thinking.\"There is no current end in sight for the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.On Tuesday, a Republican-backed House bill that would fund the government temporarily failed to win approval in the Senate for the 13th time.Nearly all Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the Republican bill because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.The enhanced tax credits currently used by about 20 million Americans to reduce the cost of health plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces are due to expire at the end of the year.",

    "body": "The UBS Group AG headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, July 30, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwiss banking giant UBS on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter net profit, driven by solid investment banking performance and the release of legal provisions.Net profit attributable to shareholders came in at $2.5 billion for the three-month period, up 74% from $1.43 billion in the same period of last year. Analysts had expected third-quarter net profit of $1.85 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.Switzerland's largest bank said its net profit included net litigation reserve releases of $668 million, primarily due to the resolution of legal matters related to Credit Suisse's residential mortgage-backed securities business and its legacy cross-border activities in France.UBS posted third-quarter revenues of $12.76 billion, slightly above analyst expectations of $12.68 billion.Shares of UBS rose 2% shortly after Wednesday's opening bell. The stock price is up more than 13% so far this year.\"I'm very happy that the breadth and the quality of our diversified business model has once again delivered very strong results,\" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Carolin Roth.watch nowEmotti said investments in strategic areas were paying off and the bank reported good progress on its complex integration of Credit Suisse. The integration process of its domestic rival is set to complete by the end of next year.UBS said it had reached $10 billion of its expected $13 billion in cost savings, well ahead of schedule, noting that more than two-thirds of Swiss-booked client accounts have now been migrated.UBS formally completed the legal takeover of its domestic rival as part of a state-backed rescue in 2023.The bank now faces a potentially significant increase in its mandatory capital requirements, however, as the government seeks to learn from Credit Suisse's collapse and reduce risks for taxpayers and the economy.UBS, for its part, said in June that while it supports most of the regulatory proposals outlined by the Swiss Federal Council, it \"strongly disagrees\" with what it described as the \"extreme\" increase in capital requirements.Market sentiment 'can shift quickly'UBS said wealth management pulled in $38 billion in net new assets over the third quarter.Looking ahead, UBS said the bank is \"likely to see more modest sequential gross and net saves in the fourth quarter,\" citing its continued focus on the Swiss platform migration and a seasonal uptick in non-personnel costs.The Swiss bank said investors appear to be increasingly focused on hedging downside risks, noting some recent spikes in market volatility.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSwiss bank UBS' share performance year-to-date\"Against this backdrop, transactional activity and our deal pipelines remain healthy, though sentiment can shift quickly as confidence in the outlook is tested and seasonal effects come into play,\" UBS said in a statement.\"Furthermore, macro uncertainties along with a strong Swiss franc and higher US tariffs are clouding the outlook for the Swiss economy, and a prolonged US government shutdown may delay capital market activities,\" it added.Earlier in the month, the Swiss government trimmed its 2026 economic forecast for the country, citing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy. In August, the White House imposed tariffs of 39% on Swiss goods sent to the U.S. after a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials.It represents one of the highest country-specific tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.",

    "body": "A Debut Biotech petri dish.Courtesy: Debut BiotechIn a lab tucked away in southern California, scientists at Debut Biotech are testing molecules using advanced biotechnology to create new skincare formulations.The San Diego-based company, founded nearly seven years ago, is pioneering new ingredients to specially target various aspects of skin health. One of the company's latest innovations, an ingredient named EDL, will be used in a new skin-tightening product with Image Skincare scheduled to hit the shelves next year, CNBC has learned.\"The reason why we exist is we do believe that biology can make better things and it can deliver sustainable performance alternatives to what's currently available for the world,\" CEO Joshua Britton told CNBC.The company focuses on identifying and copying molecules found in nature, refining and scaling those ingredients for their specific skin longevity benefits, and formulating them into products that satisfy consumer needs. Britton defined biotechnology as the use of advanced tech to \"discover, validate and commercialize higher performing ingredients.\" But Debut's \"secret sauce,\" he added, is the company's vertically integrated company structure, which ensures it can perform its research and development and also see its products into the supply chain, all in-house.\"Like pharmaceutical companies, they own their manufacturing processes, they own the making of the product, they own the marketing around the product and they sell directly to doctors,\" Britton said. \"And so the synthetic biology industry had to learn that, overcome those issues, but now it's taken off, and we're seeing real change.\"Debut then works with its slate of clients, from beauty giant L'Oreal to smaller brands like Reome, to incorporate its ingredients into products and formulations.Because of its vertical integration structure, Debut is able to speed up its process, Britton said, with iteration cycles taking just one to two weeks, allowing the company to ensure its discoveries make it directly into the hands of consumers.\"The investor base on the private and public side has always seen the promise of biotechnology but have always invested into companies who are horizontal and have unfortunately lost a lot of money,\" Britton said. \"But now the investors are starting to see things turn up in the supermarket, in the local market, in supply chains — we're about to see this resurgence of biotechnology, and the resurgence this time will have a product focus, not a science focus.\"That structure is becoming increasingly important for beauty brands, according to Lindy Firstenberg, AlixPartners' senior vice president of beauty and luxury. The consumer base is becoming more educated about the products they're putting on their skin, with the rise of what Firstenberg calls the \"consumer Ph.D.\" With the more knowledgeable customer, she said, comes a greater demand for hard science typically seen in the pharmaceutical sector. \"Because of that, you've seen this rise of vertical integration, and what it's really doing is it's delivering for the customer what they're really asking for,\" she told CNBC. \"Because these consumers are asking for holistic programs, they're thinking about infusions, injectables, ingestibles, topicals, tool therapy; they're really looking for absolutely everything.\"In a world in which beauty and wellness have become deeply ingrained and intertwined with everyday routines, Firstenberg said she believes biotechnology in the industry is not just a fad and instead here to stay.\"I actually do think that you'll end up having these beauty, health and wellness companies that are integrated, and they have different delivery methodologies and different delivery systems, because you're going to have fewer beauty, health and wellness companies that can actually do it,\" Firstenberg said. \"The ones that can do it are really, really going to set themselves apart.\"Inside a lab at Debut Biotech with CEO Joshua Britton.Courtesy: Debut BiotechNew innovationsSome of Debut's ingredients are already on the market. Earlier this year, it partnered with Reome to introduce an ingredient named DHK, targeting skin barrier repair and derived from the Joshua Tree cactus in the desert.Reome founder Joanna Ellner said using natural ingredients alone often produces inconsistent results based on varying harvests and can harm the environment, but biotech allows Reome to use those components in a more sustainable and consistent way.\"Based on the delivery system of biotech ingredients, we have the power to hit new levels of efficacy within skincare that have never been possible before,\" Ellner told CNBC. The company's eye cream, featuring Debut's DHK molecule, focuses on firming the skin around the eyes, and Ellner said it is 1.3 times more effective than standard ingredients like vitamin C. \"For me, the thrill is we are genuinely working with new ingredients, and we are generally at the very sharp end of innovation,\" Ellner said. \"We are not combining a bunch of pre-existing ingredients together and calling it a new word or some kind of compound — this is real.\"The new collaboration with Image Skincare features Debut's EDL ingredient, which focuses on the viral topic of skin tightening. The company, which most recently developed a topical product to firm skin for GLP-1 patients experiencing rapid weight loss, aims to be at the forefront of innovation and new trends, according to CEO Sennen Pamich.The new partnership with Debut aligned with just that, he added.In initial clinical trials, Pamich said the company has seen the product's ability to enhance skin longevity and vitality when combined with Image's pre-existing formulations, including its technology that allows antioxidants to deeply penetrate the skin.\"There is a very high level of application of biotech in the pharmaceutical world, right? So why not in skincare and beauty?\" Pamich said. Future of biotechDebut is still in the lab developing more biotech ingredients to target specific consumer concerns, like its new PNAR ingredient, which helps with hyperpigmentation. While that process could take other companies close to two decades, the use of artificial intelligence and biotech to arrive at these ingredients allows Debut's process to take just around a year, Britton added.And that speed, efficiency and accuracy is why he believes biotech is the future of innovation, not just in beauty. While Debut chose the beauty sector specifically for its higher margins, Britton said he can see vertical integration and biotech being useful in a variety of other industries, like nutrition.A lab at Debut Biotech.Courtesy: Debut BiotechThat sentiment was echoed by Oliver Wright, Accenture's global consumer industries lead, who emphasized that the technology's ability to create targeted molecules while prioritizing sustainability will allow it to flourish.According to research from Accenture, demand for bioengineered ingredients is expected to grow 15% to 20% annually through 2026, driven by Gen Z's trust in science-backed solutions. The market for biotech skincare is expected to surpass $8 billion by 2031, according to Precision Business Insights.\"Biotech is about enhancing nature's products – yes, it takes place in labs, but it is fundamentally about taking a human product that exists in nature and actually making sure that you refine that and create it for human benefit,\" Wright told CNBC. \"So people don't need to be scared of it in the way that they might do otherwise.\"In other words, this new technology is moving the needle — and beauty giants like Sephora and Ulta will need to take notice and shape their messaging for consumers who may be overwhelmed by the plethora of options, Wright said. Still, the next step is toward the \"holy grail of cosmetics,\" he said: personalized beauty. With the advent of generative AI and consumers' growing knowledge of science and technology, Wright said he expects there to be a broadening of the definition of beauty to encapsulate wellness. \"I think the destination here is going to be the increasing ability for us to tailor this through diagnostics, through, therefore, product selection, but then increasingly towards actual personalization,\" Wright said. \"I think in effect, if we fast forward 10 years, that will be the normal in the industry.\"",

    "body": "Signage for a CVS pharmacy in Takoma Park, Maryland, US, on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCVS Health on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past estimates and raised its adjusted profit outlook, as the company sees improvement in its insurance unit.Still, shares of CVS fell more than 3% in premarket trading Wednesday as the company posted a net loss during the quarter, which reflects a $5.7 billion goodwill impairment charge related to the health care services segment's health care delivery reporting unit.The quarterly results cap David Joyner's first full year as CEO of the company, which struggled to drive higher profits and improve its stock performance under its last top executive, Karen Lynch. Joyner is executing aggressive efforts to turn the flailing drugstore chain around – from executive reshuffling to cost cuts – and they already seem to be paying off, with shares up more than 85% for the year.The company now expects fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings of $6.55 to $6.65 per share, up from previous guidance of $6.30 to $6.40 per share. CVS has now hiked its outlook for three consecutive quarters.\"[I] couldn't be more happy about the fact that this is three quarters where we've had a beat and raise and obviously, looking into Q4, we feel really, really good about our ability to close out the year favorably,\" Joyner said in an interview. He pointed to several factors, including recovery in Aetna, the company's insurer. Aetna and other insurers have grappled with higher-than-expected medical costs over the last year as more Medicare Advantage patients return to hospitals for procedures they delayed during the pandemic. While medical costs remain high, Aetna and other insurers, such as UnitedHealthcare, appear to be becoming better equipped to navigate the issue moving forward.Joyner also highlighted a \"really good sales season\" for its pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark, and the goodwill impairment charge related to the health care delivery reporting unit.Here's what CVS reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.60 adjusted vs. $1.37 expectedRevenue: $102.87 billion vs. $98.85 billion expectedThe company posted net loss of $3.99 billion, or $3.13 per share, for the third quarter. That compares with net income of $71 million, or 7 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. In a release, CVS said the loss reflects the goodwill impairment charge related to the health care delivery reporting unit, which has \"continued to experience challenges which have impacted its ability to grow the business at the rate previously estimated.\" The company made several changes to that segment's management team and finalized strategic changes, including plans to reduce the number of primary care clinics it would open in 2026 and beyond. \"We've effectively made the decision this quarter to both slow the clinic growth and also close some of the underperforming clinics,\" Joyner said. He noted that CVS has announced that it will close 16 locations of primary care provider Oak Street Health. But Joyner said \"this does not change our views of value-based care,\" noting that Oak Street Health is \"actually performing according to plan.\" Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and capital losses, adjusted earnings were $1.60 per share for the quarter.CVS booked sales of $102.87 billion for the third quarter, up 7.8% from the same period a year ago as all three of its business segments grew. Wall Street didn't expect CVS to reach quarterly sales of more than $100 billion until the fourth quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates. Growth across business unitsAll three of CVS' business units beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for the third quarter, with notable improvements in the insurance business. The insurance segment's medical benefit ratio – a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected – decreased to 92.8% from 95.2 % a year earlier. A lower ratio typically indicates that a company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.That ratio is slightly higher than the 92.4% that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.CVS said that was driven by the \"favorable year-over-year impact of premium deficiency reserves recorded as health care costs\" and improved underlying performance in the insurance unit's government business, among other factors. Premium deficiency reserves refers to a liability that an insurer may need to cover if future premiums are not enough to pay for anticipated claims and expenses.Aetna's government business serves plans including Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug, or Part D, plans.The insurance business booked $35.99 billion in revenue during the quarter, up more than 9% from the third quarter of 2024. Analysts expected the unit to take in $34.48 billion for the period, according to estimates from StreetAccount.CVS said that growth was driven by increases in the government business, largely due to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program. Provisions of that law have contributed to increases in some Medicare Part D premiums.CVS' pharmacy and consumer wellness division posted $36.21 billion in sales for the third quarter, up 11.7% from the same period a year earlier.CVS said the increase came partly from higher prescription volume, including from the company's acquisition of prescriptions from Rite Aid, but offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Analysts expected sales of $35.6 billion for the quarter, StreetAccount said.That unit dispenses prescriptions in CVS' more than 9,000 retail pharmacies and provides other pharmacy services, such as vaccinations and diagnostic testing.CVS' health services segment generated $49.27 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 11.6% compared with the same quarter in 2024. Analysts expected the unit to post $45.71 billion in sales for the period, according to StreetAccount.That unit includes Caremark, which negotiates drug discounts with manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans and creates lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburses pharmacies for prescriptions.— CNBC's Bertha Coombs contributed to this report",

    "body": "A Boeing 777x is displayed during the International Paris Air Show at the Paris-Le Bourget Airport on June 20, 2023.Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty ImagesBoeing said Wednesday its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years but it took a $4.9 billion charge on additional delays of its long-awaited 777X wide-body plane.Boeing is on track to deliver the most aircraft this year since 2018, before two crashes grounded its best-selling jetliner, the Covid pandemic hit supply chains and a host of manufacturing crises drove years of losses at the top U.S. exporter.CEO Kelly Ortberg, an aerospace veteran who came out of retirement to helm Boeing in August 2024, has worked to steady the manufacturer's sprawling supply chain and cash-generating production lines.The 777X, an updated version of its 777 plane, took its first flight nearly six years ago but still hasn't won regulator approval. Boeing says it now expects the first delivery in 2027, leading to the non-cash charge.A Boeing 777x aircraft during an aerial display on the opening day of the Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, UK, on Monday, July 18, 2022.Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"While there's still more work to do to advance our development programs, particularly on our commercial development and certification programs, we're seeing positive signs across our business, and I'm proud of how we are coming together to turn our company around,\" Ortberg said in a staff note.Still, Boeing generated free cash flow of $238 million, its first time in the black on that metric since late 2023.Boeing lost $4.78 billion, or $7.14 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. That's better than a $5.76 billion loss a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of $7.47 a share. Revenue jumped 30% to $23.27 billion for the third quarter, up from $17.84 billion a year ago and ahead of analysts' estimates.A year ago, Boeing machinists were on strike in a contract impasse that crippled production at the majority of the company's commercial airplane factories.Here's how Boeing performed for the third quarter based compared with analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $7.47 per share adjusted vs. a loss of $4.59 expectedRevenue: $23.27 billion vs. $21.97 billion expectedAirline customers have said they've seen an improvement at Boeing, with more accurate delivery projections, a change in tune from the complaints of prior years.In the first nine months of the year, Boeing delivered 440 airplanes, up from 291 in the same period last year. Airlines and other customers pay for the bulk of the planes when they receive them, so increasing the delivery pace is key for Boeing to stem an outflow of cash totaling close to $17 billion since the start of 2024 through June of this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom.

Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration lifted a production cap for Boeing's 737 Max to 42 a month from 38, a restriction it put in place after the accident.The FAA is also now allowing Boeing to perform final signoffs on some of its aircraft, a sign of increased confidence from its regulator.Boeing's commercial unit revenue rose 49% from a year earlier to $11.09 billion, though it still had negative operating margins. Its defense unit generated $6.9 billion, up 25% from last year in the third quarter, with a 1.7% operating margin, while its profitable global services business brought in nearly $5.4 billion, a 10% increase.The company isn't out of the woods. Its Max 7 and Max 10 variants and the 777X are years behind schedule.And about 3,200 of its defense unit workers who make F-15 fighter jets and missile systems have been on strike since the summer as the two sides have yet to reach a new contract.",

The stock is one of the top-performing San Francisco-based companies profiled by CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Power Lunch this week from the City by the Bay.The stock surged in early September after the company posted strong phase 3 trial results for its lead cardio drug called Aficamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, which showed an improvement in exercise capacity in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cytokinetics is now awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its drug, fueling strong investor interest in the company as this drug could disrupt a space dominated by publicly traded biotech giant Bristol Myers Squibb.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCytokinetics stock performance over the past month.Cytokinetics originally discovered and developed drugs that are tied to heart disease, and one of those drugs, called Mavacamten, was later acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2020. Under the transaction agreements, Bristol Myers Squibb obtained the rights to use the drug for products it is developing or commercializing, while Cytokinetics gained capital which it then used to fund more clinical trials.Now, Cytokinetics' new drug is looking to compete directly with Bristol Myers Squibb, given that it targets the same disease.\"[Bristol Myers Squibb] are actually commercializing a medicine that was discovered in our laboratories, and ultimately the subject of a company we formed that they acquired. They're now selling that, doing a great job. Patients are benefiting from that medicine,\" Blum said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" We're now in the process of developing a next-generation medicine that will hopefully enter the same space. It's in front of the FDA for a potential approval later this year.\"Cytokinetics has received funding from specialized biotech financing firms, and uses a mix of royalty financing and partnerships to secure investments for its drug development.\"That journey required us to do a number of things as we invested in research at the moment, and ultimately did some financial engineering in order to support the billions of dollars that we've spent advancing a portfolio of potential medicines,\" Blum told CNBC. He added that heart disease is the primary reason for hospitalization among Americans, especially an increasing aging demographic.\"Our pipeline, our portfolio of potential medicines directed to those diseases, we're in a good position to build an enduring business starting with this first potential medicine,\" he said.",

    "body": "Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats.Melissa Repko | CNBCMINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin.Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in the Hudson Valley.With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: Designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price.Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers.As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled about 35% in the last year, as its own merchandising issues, a sloppier store experience and boycotts over its rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion programs all weigh on its business. Discretionary items, long a strength for Target, have also become a tougher sell for shoppers, as groceries and rent hit household budgets.The company is undergoing major changes as it tries to reverse its struggles. Last week, the retailer announced it would cut 1,800 corporate jobs — its largest round of layoffs in a decade.Target is also gearing up for a leadership transition. Michael Fiddelke, the company's chief operating officer and former chief financial officer who has spent two decades at the company, will start as Target's CEO in February as Brian Cornell retires.Target CEO Michael Fiddelke poses for a portrait at Target headquarters in Minneapolis, Minn. on Tuesday, June 24, 2025.Elizabeth Flores | The Minnesota Star Tribune | Getty ImagesIn an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters, Fiddelke outlined his three key priorities as he steps into the company's top job: regaining Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.He said elevating Target's merchandising authority — which earned it the nickname \"Tarzhay\" among shoppers — \"is a critical first priority for me.\"\"When we lead with style and design, when our guests can walk into a Target store or scroll through the app and find that stylish, unique thing that ideally they could only find at Target, that's at an unexpected value, that's when we're at our best,\" he said.The crucial holiday shopping season will test whether Target's efforts to refresh its merchandise are bearing fruit. Nearly a third of its annual sales came from the holiday quarter last year.Yet to draw eyeballs to fresh merchandise, Target will have to overcome a fundamental challenge: Fewer shoppers are coming to its stores.Read moreTarget's store traffic has fallen nearly every week since late January, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate visits to locations. In September, monthly store traffic declined by 7.6% year over year across Target's locations — its steepest decline since February, the firm found.Customer transactions and the average amount shoppers spent when they visited Target's stores or website dropped year over year in the retailer's most recently reported fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 2.Oliver Chen, a senior equity research analyst who covers retail and luxury goods for TD Cowen, said Target's competition from a wide range of retailers, including TJMaxx, Shein and Amazon, has grown fiercer. Plus, social media means trends move faster than before — forcing Target to adapt to stay ahead.\"It's not like they disappeared, but if you and I were the same and we didn't change, we would be less relevant in the age of TikTok,\" he said. \"You can't stand still.\"For the holiday quarter, Target is trying to capitalize on fresh merchandise to attract shoppers. Fiddelke said Target will have 20,000 new items in the fourth quarter, double what the company had a year ago.Target launches limited-time collections with brands to try to fuel shoppers' excitement and create buzz. It recently launched a collection with Woolrich, a Pennsylvania-based outdoorswear company with items including sweaters, pancake mix and camping chairs.Melissa Repko | CNBCOut with the basic and beigeNeon footballs, 1980s-themed Doritos and an aisle of colorful Owala waterbottles with mix-and-match lids.On a recent store tour in Edina, a suburb of Target's hometown of Minneapolis, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez pointed out those examples of Target's fresher approach to merchandise for the fall and holiday season. He said the colorful assortment marks a shift from the past few years, when Target's merchandise became \"too basic\" after the pandemic.\"Everybody was quarantined,\" he said. \"Nobody was traveling. Nobody was out there getting inspired. Our designers were stuck at home. Our merchants were stuck at home. We weren't seeing new fabrications, new silhouettes, new trends. We didn't have our finger on the pulse of consumer culture, what was trending, what was happening. We lost touch.\"He added that when Target got stuck with too much of the wrong stuff as people's spending shifted after the pandemic, its team reacted by \"making conservative decisions,\" not only about the size of orders but also about the styles they picked.For example, Target's back-to-college collection in fall 2024 included mostly neutral-colored and gray dorm accessories and furniture — and performed poorly. The company reversed that approach this fall, adding back \"mix-and-match\" dorm decor for a wider range of styles \"across everything from preppy, glam [and] modern,\" Gomez said. That led to higher sales.\"It was a proof point to us that, let's get back to listening to the consumer, trusting our instincts, and then leaning into style and design,\" he said.Kiosks display copies of the new Taylor Swift album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" at a Target in Watertown, MA on October 5, 2025.Jason Bergman | Sipa USA | APNow, Gomez said he's trying to embolden merchants and designers to \"unleash your creativity.\"\"We cannot be a leader in style and design if we're going to be playing it safe, if we're going to be conservative, if we're going to live in a world of neutrals,\" he said.Those efforts go beyond clothing and home goods. Among its recent moves, Target launched a collection inspired by Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" timed to coincide with the TV series' final season, including T-shirts, action figures and Chips Ahoy, Doritos and Frosted Flakes with 1980s labels. This fall, it has a limited-time collaboration with Pennsylvania-based outdoorswear company Woolrich with red-and-black checkered shirts, camper chairs, and pancake mix, among other items. And as Taylor Swift's new album launched, it opened stores at midnight so customers could get their hands on exclusive vinyls and CDs of \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"Yet Gomez said Target's changes will take time, and some will not take hold until next year. In particular, he said Target needs to revive sales in its home and hardlines categories.Target has renamed hardlines to Fun101, a category that includes items like sporting goods, TVs and laptops. It has also slimmed down the number of bulky and basic items that it sells, such as carrying fewer bicycles, TVs and printers, and more items where it can stand out on style or design, like water bottles, coolers and tech accessories, he said.Target is trying to refresh its home category with new collaborations, including Marvel- and Disney-themed bedding for its kids' home line, Pillowfort, which launched in February.He said home is another area of the store that needs \"major work,\" in both its products and experience. In the spring, Target will give its largest private label home brand, Threshold, a new look.It's tried to refresh the home category in the meantime with three new collaborations this year: Disney- and Marvel-themed kids' bedding collections for its private brand Pillowfort; a line of bedding and bath items from direct-to-consumer brand Parachute; and a collaboration with \"Queer Eye\" star Jeremiah Brent, which will launch in December.Target's own brands — which are sold only on its website and stores — are a critical part of how it stands out. Along with selling national names like Levi's, it has more than 40 of its own brands, including kids' clothing brand Cat & Jack, activewear line All in Motion and a new floral line called Good Little Garden. Target private brands drove about $31 billion in sales last year, accounting for nearly 30% of its annual net sales.Target is turning its store in New York City's SoHO neighborhood into a new concept that shows off more of its fashion-forward, unique merchandise. The store, shown in a company rendering, will have bolder displays that rotate.Courtesy of TargetA new style displayOne of the clearest illustrations of Target's effort to regain its reputation for style and design will land soon in New York City's SoHo neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and Houston St.Starting in November, the big-box retailer is turning that neighborhood store into a new concept that shows off more of its fashion-forward, unique merchandise and carries less of its convenience-store staples like toothpaste, shampoo and snacks, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.Target chose the location because it sits in an influential global style capital and has higher foot traffic, Sylvester said. She added the store will feel more like a \"pop-up shop,\" with Target rotating merchandise monthly and showing off its products — such as fashion-forward clothing and home collaborations — in \"bold, iconic displays.\"Even beauty items and basics will look different, as Target plans to show them off in a more \"stylized way,\" she said. And the retailer may expand aspects of the concept store to other locations, she said.\"It's a really important place for us to say 'This is who Target is,'\" Sylvester said. \"And we want to really evoke that sense of discovery.\"Behind the scenes, Target is enlisting a new tech tool to spot and react to trends faster. Early this year, it began using Target Trend Brain, a generative artificial intelligence-powered tool built to help the company's designers and merchants identify the colors, materials and silhouettes that customers want and move more quickly to turn those insights into items.Instead of having employees manually review and tag images from fashion runways, the AI-powered tool can help synthesize photos to forecast what will be popular in the coming seasons. For instance, Target used the tool to reinforce its initial forecast that greens, berries and blues would be the must-have colors of the fall and winter.Jenny Breeden, Target's senior vice president of product design and packaging, said the tool allows Target's trend and design teams to do a \"pulse check\" closer to when they set merchandise for a season and make adjustments.Target is trying to regain its reputation for creative and unique merchandise this holiday season. One example of its new items is its plush charcuterie sets from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape.Melissa Repko | CNBCSome of Target's creative designs will soon hit shelves: charcuterie-inspired plush sets for kids from Target's private label toy brand, Gigglescape; subtle Western-inspired tops for its womenswear line Universal Thread; and gifting options like assorted chocolate truffles from one of its food brands, Favorite Day.Yet as Target tries to regain its reputation for affordable style, some of its freshest ideas for holiday gifts and winter apparel have come from employees getting out in the world, Breeden said. As the merchants and designers traveled, they observed textures, fonts, graphics and other details that they took back to Target's design studio in Minneapolis.Those trips resumed after the Covid pandemic, but with a new spin, she said. Instead of traveling with just one category's team, Target is bringing employees across categories. For example, the company sought ideas in European ski resorts and holiday markets for both apparel and home.She said the team also wants to get closer to its customers and the trends influencing them, even going to college dorms and tailgates and attending music festivals.\"We really realized that we needed to go deeper and go to the real source of where the trends were emerging, because culture is moving so fast,\" Breeden said. \"Gone are the days where you wait for Fashion Week and see how it trickles through.\"\"It's pretty incredible how eye-opening that is when you're really there in it, versus seeing it from an artist's distance,\" she said.",

    "body": "A visitor looks at a model of SK hynix's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology during the 2025 World IT Show in Seoul on April 24, 2025. Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday posted record quarterly revenue and profit, boosted by a strong demand for its high bandwidth memory used in generative AI chipsets.The company is looking to expand production capacity in 2026, with its planned supply of memory products for 2026 already sold out.Here are SK Hynix's third-quarter results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 24.45 trillion won ($17.13 billion) vs. 24.73 trillion wonOperating profit: 11.38 trillion won vs. 11.39 trillion wonRevenue rose about 39% in the September quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, while operating profit surged 62%, year on year.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, revenue was up 10%, while operating profit grew 24%. In its earnings release, the company noted that the quarterly operating profit had surpassed 10 trillion won for the first time.Following the report, SK Hynix shares in South Korea popped nearly 5%, boosting its stock rally past 210% this year.SK Hynix makes memory chips that are used to store data and can be found in everything from servers to consumer devices such as smartphones and laptops.The company has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence as a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory or HBM chips used to power AI data center servers. \"As demand across the memory segment has soared due to customers' expanding investments in AI infrastructure, SK Hynix once again surpassed the record-high performance of the previous quarter due to increased sales of high value-added products,\" SK Hynix said in a statement. HBM falls into the broader category of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM — a type of semiconductor memory used to store data and program code that can be found in PCs, workstations and servers.The company said it will begin supplying its next-generation HBM4 chips in the current quarter, following negotiations with unspecified customers. The chips represent the sixth generation of HBM technology.In an earnings call, an SK Hynix executive said that the company's HBM product has been selling out since 2023, with its HBM supply expected to remain tight compared to demand into 2027 as it works to increase production.HBM leaderSK Hynix has set itself apart in the DRAM market by getting an early lead in HBM and establishing itself as the main supplier to the world's leading AI chip designer, Nvidia. However, its main competitors, U.S.-based Micron and South Korean-based tech giant Samsung, have been working to catch up in the space.Micron has already supplied Nvidia with some of its HBM technology, while Samsung recently passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM product, according to a local report last month.\"With the innovation of AI technology, the memory market has shifted to a new paradigm and demand has begun to spread to all product areas,\" SK Hynix Chief Financial Officer Kim Woohyun said in the earnings release.\"We will continue to strengthen our AI memory leadership by responding to customer demand through market-leading products and differentiated technological capabilities,\" he added.watch nowThe HBM market is expected to continue to boom over the next few years to around $43 billion by 2027, giving strong earnings leverage to memory manufacturers such as SK Hynix, MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"[F]or SK Hynix to continue generating profits, it'll be important for the company to maintain and enhance its competitive edge,\" he added.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month showed that SK Hynix held a leading 38% share of the DRAM market by revenue in the second quarter, increasing its shares after having overtaken Samsung in the first quarter. The report added that the global HBM  market grew 178% year over year in the second quarter, and SK Hynix dominated the space with a 64% share. Samsung will report its earnings on Thursday.Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC that he expects SK Hynix to maintain its dominant leadership in the HBM market through next year, thanks to its technological edge.\"The company is likely to sustain around 60% global HBM market share, underpinned by its position as the primary supplier to key customers such as Nvidia, Google and other leading customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 28: U.S. President Donald Trump (L) and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (R) hold up signed documents for a critical minerals/rare earth deal with Japan during a meeting at Akasaka Palace on October 28, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News U.S. President Donald Trump's push to secure rare earth supply deals across Asia will ultimately weaken China's dominance in the global supply chain for critical minerals — but analysts said the buildup will take years.Over 10 days, Trump cemented deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and most recently, Japan, to bolster the supply of rare earths and other critical minerals that are crucial for the making of batteries, automobiles, defense systems and computing chips.The flurry of deals — part of Washington's bid to counter Beijing's chokehold on the sector — comes ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan on Thursday.The deals may \"benefit immensely from being linked together in a plurilateral agreement with strong commitments, financing and pooling of resources,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. She expects more of such deals to follow under the Trump administration.Trump and Xi are expected to address several contentious issues that have stalled the long-running trade talks, including Beijing's rare earth export controls and Washington's tariff threats and technology restrictions.In the medium term, we will get off the Chinese supply chain, but in the short term, there's still a great deal of dependency on China.Dennis WilderSenior fellow at Georgetown UniversityThe most recent win for Trump was an agreement with Japan aimed at securing the supply of raw and processed critical minerals while also pledging funding for selected projects within the next six months. Earlier pacts with Australia, Malaysia and Thailand also outlined multibillion-dollar plans, commitments to fair trade practices and to avoid export bans or quotas.While Trump's deals will bring much-needed financial support to the industry and may eventually challenge Beijing's stranglehold over rare earths, experts said the efforts will be costly and take years to bear fruit. \"What we are trying to do now is to get off the Chinese as the primary supply chain, but that will take time,\" said Dennis Wilder, a former senior U.S. intelligence official and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University.\"In the medium term, we will get off the Chinese supply chain, but in the short term, there's still a great deal of dependency on China,\" Wilder stressed.Goldman Sachs estimates new rare earth mines tend to take up to a decade to develop, with known reserves for certain elements \"very scarce\" outside of Myanmar and China, while building refineries would take about 5 years.China dominates 69% of the market share for rare earth mining, 92% of refining and 98% of magnet manufacturing, the bank estimates. Level playing fieldThese deals are a \"game-changer\" that could reduce the U.S. vulnerabilities to Beijing's export controls, stabilize rare earth prices and accelerate domestic innovative refining and recycling, said Brodie Sutherland, CEO of Patriot Critical Minerals Corp, a U.S.-based critical minerals developer.With assured access to raw materials from friendly nations, American firms can focus on efficient extraction, ethical mining and value-added processing, said Sutherland.He also cited longer-term benefits such as lower risk premiums on financing, faster permitting for new sites and a \"level playing field against subsidized foreign competitors.\"China has allowed rare earth prices to swing in very \"strategic\" ways to make projects in other countries unprofitable, said Mike Rosenberg, a professor of strategic management at IESE Business School.By using public funds to back these projects, global miners and refiners ought to be able to make investments that guarantee a reasonable return, Rosenberg added.Efforts to diversify and reshore production, however, will inevitably mean accepting some environmental tradeoffs, experts said.Mining and refining rare earth materials in an ecologically friendly way is \"very, very expensive,\" Rosenberg noted, while China kept costs low by limiting environmental controls.\"Consumers may need to accept higher prices for electronics and green technologies that reflect their true material and environmental cost,\" said Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Center at Chatham House.The policy push has also fueled a rally in several U.S.-listed rare earth miners this year. New York-listed shares of MP Materials and Trilogy Metals have each more than quadrupled, Energy Fuels has tripled, while Critical Metals is up nearly 90% and USA Rare Earth about 75%, according to LSEG data.Wake-up callTrump likely rushed to sign these deals to gain leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi in Seoul this week, analysts said.U.S. officials said earlier this week that they expected China to delay imposing export controls on critical minerals for a year as part of a broader trade deal, briefly cooling a rally in mining stocks.watch now\"Beijing's latest threat on sweeping extraterritorial export restrictions in this sector has served as a needed wake-up call to partners around the world,\" said Asia Society Policy Institute's Cutler.China may have miscalculated with the export controls that rattled the global economy and widened the trade war to include other nations, said Wilder of Georgetown University, noting that \"it wasn't in China's interest.\"\"It was a useful weapon when it was targeted at the U.S., but it becomes less useful when you try and expand that to the rest of the world,\" Wilder said. \"Because then you bring the rest of the world over to the U.S. in many ways.\"",

    "body": "TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 27: U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One as he arrives at Haneda Airport on October 27, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. Takashi Aoyama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to lower fentanyl-linked tariffs on China as Beijing confirmed a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the American leader.A spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Xi will meet Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday to exchange views on issues of shared concerns, without elaborating.\"We are willing to work with the U.S. to push the meeting toward achieving positive outcomes,\" the spokesperson said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One that fentanyl flows into the U.S. and \"farmers\" will be among topics he expects to discuss with Xi on Thursday.When asked whether the potential one-year pause in Beijing's implementation of rare earth export controls would be enough to draw more concessions from the U.S., Trump said \"we haven't talked about the timing yet but we are gonna work out something.\"The two leaders' meeting — their first in-person sit-down since Trump's return to the office in January — comes as bilateral tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Beijing has turned up the heat on rare earth export controls, while Washington has retaliated with port fees on Chinese ships and threatened software-related export restrictions. A delicate trade detente between the world's top two economies that includes lower tariffs on each other's goods is nearing its expiration on Nov. 10, if they fail to agree on another extension. Trump has also threatened additional 100% tariffs on Beijing starting Nov. 1. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the U.S. could cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by half, in return for Beijing's crack down on the export of chemicals that make fentanyl. If Washington were to lower those tariffs to 10%, that would bring the average duty on most Chinese imports — currently around 55% — to about 45%.On whether Taiwan would be on the agenda, Trump said \"I don't know if we'll even speak about Taiwan. He may want to ask about it. There is not that much to ask about it.\"Answering a question about exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China, Trump said \"I think we may be talking about that with President Xi.\"watch nowIn a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to reach an agreement with Xi, which will be \"a good deal for both.\" The U.S. will also finalize a trade agreement with South Korea \"very soon,\" he added.Chinese President Xi will also deliver a speech at the summit and hold bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, a spokesperson of the ministry said last Friday.The U.S. president kicked off his whirlwind Asia trip on Sunday, signing a flurry of trade and mineral agreements with Southeast Asian leaders and most recently Japan.Likely outcomes from the Trump-Xi meeting include Beijing's guarantee of ensuring the U.S. access to rare earth items under its export-control measures, purchases of Boeing aircraft, approval for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operation and more efforts on curbing fentanyl flows, according to Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI.In return, the U.S. could offer to loosen export controls on certain semiconductor equipment and AI chips, roll back the 100% tariff threat, in addition to a reduction of 10 percentage points in the fentanyl-linked tariffs, starting from Nov. 10 as part of a renewed tariff truce, Wang said.\"We expect Beijing to give Trump a way out on the fentanyl deadlock, such as via a new promise from Xi in person, to facilitate Trump's reduction on China fentanyl tariff, effective no later than Nov. 10,\" Wang added.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "A traffic light shows red in front of the US Capitol, in Washington DC , October 14, 2025.Celal Gunes/ | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Tuesday extended a temporary order blocking the Trump administration's plans to fire thousands of federal employees during the government shutdown.The order, called a preliminary injunction, prohibits the administration from issuing reduction-in-force, or RIF, notices until the government reopens, Judge Susan Illston said during a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.Illston had imposed a short-term firing freeze, known as a temporary restraining order or TRO, on Oct. 15.The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, one of the labor-union plaintiffs in the lawsuit, praised the judge's latest order.\"Today's ruling is another victory for federal workers and our ongoing efforts to protect their jobs from an administration hellbent on illegally firing them,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement.The American Federation of Government Employees, another plaintiff in the case, called the ruling a \"big win for federal workers!\"The labor unions, which represent federal civilian employees, filed the lawsuit on the eve of the shutdown to preemptively challenge the Trump administration's stated plans to conduct mass layoffs in the event of a lapse in federal funding.President Donald Trump has said that the shutdown — which is now the second-longest ever — gives his administration an \"opportunity\" to slash what he has described as \"Democrat Agencies.\"Days after the shutdown began, the plaintiffs expanded their lawsuit to include dozens of additional federal agencies and their leaders. The Trump administration said it had issued around 4,000 RIFs on Oct. 10.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteWhite House Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the right-wing government policy guidebook known as Project 2025, said the following week that the total RIF number would likely \"end up being north of 10,000.\"Vought's remark came on the same day that Illston granted her TRO, which slammed the mid-shutdown layoff plans as \"unprecedented in our country's history.\"The White House, asked for comment on Tuesday's preliminary injunction order, referred CNBC to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, which did not immediately respond.Illston's ruling is \"a major blow to the Trump-Vance administration's unlawful attempt to make the Project 2025 playbook a reality by targeting our nation's career public servants, who work for all Americans,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the legal group Democracy Forward, which represents AFSCME in the lawsuit.\"Our team is honored to represent the civil servants who are fighting back against President Trump's dangerous agenda, and to have won this crucial injunction that will help stop federal workers from continuing to be targeted and harassed by this administration during the shutdown,\" Perryman said in a statement.",

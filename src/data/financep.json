    "body": "Certain people seem so effortlessly influential, they make you wonder if they were born with some magical quality. But after researching human behavior for 15 years, I have good news. Influence is a set of learnable actions, not a fixed personality trait. In my book, \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need From the People in Charge,\" I break down how to build authority at work based on my experience advising thousands of top performers at companies like Google, Amazon, and JPMorgan. There are things you can do to be taken more seriously, get your ideas approved, and become someone leadership seeks out — even if you're introverted, still working your way up the ladder, or new to your industry. Here are five of the most powerful behaviors you can start using right now — based on five different types of power — without turning into a manipulative jerk. 1. Make clear judgment callsWhen a meeting goes in circles, influential people step in and say, \"We've covered the options. It seems like we're leaning toward X, so we'll get started on that. Sound good?\" This is role power in action, using your authority to make decisions within your domain. Most people shy away from role power because they don't want to appear controlling. But when everything is a committee decision, it creates more confusion. Try this: The next time someone raises an issue, don't let it bounce around like a hot potato. Take charge and assign ownership, \"I'll coordinate with legal. Gerald, can you drive the marketing piece?\" 2. Generously recognize others Influential people don't hoard credit. They spread appreciation around early and often. This builds reward power, or your ability to give people something they want. When you make others feel seen, they go out of their way to help you succeed.Try this: Each week, shout out a team member via email or team chat, or during a meeting. Don't just say \"the team did a good job,\" personalize your praise and be specific. For example, \"Pooja's idea saved us 10 hours of developer time!\" or, \"Big shout out to Rafael for his analysis, which flagged this risk.\"3. Project competence without cockiness   You can be the smartest person in the room. But your knowledge means nothing if no one seeks out your input or respects your opinion enough to act on it. That's the difference between expertise and expert power. Expertise is measured by your skill level, whereas expert power is about whether people trust your insight.Try this: Lead with \"what if\" and \"I wonder\" statements followed by your experience to avoid coming off as a know-it-all. For example, \"What if we tried adjusting the price? I've seen that work with similar products in the past,\" or, \"I wonder whether we've accounted for processing time since that's added a two-week delay before.\"4. Hold others accountable Even the nicest people have to enforce limits. When someone misses deadlines or violates the rules, influential people address it calmly and directly by using coercive power. This ability to punish people is the form of power you want to use the least, but sometimes it's necessary to uphold standards and keep the culture safe. You can use this even without formal authority, as long as you're in a situation where you're responsible for an outcome, like running a meeting or leading a particular project. Context matters, though. You can hold peers accountable for being disruptive, but you'll need to tread more carefully with a superior.Try this: Name the pattern, state the impact, and set an expectation. This can sound like, \"I noticed you talked over Carol twice yesterday. When people get cut off, they stop speaking up. Going forward, please let people finish their thoughts before jumping in.\" 5. Pay attention to personal details What if you could gain power just from being who you are? This is referent power, which comes from people wanting to be associated with you because of your character and values. Influential people don't treat relationships transactionally. When you make people feel seen and valued, they're more likely to trust you, support your ideas, and want to work with you. Try this: When someone shares something personal, make a reminder and follow up on it. It takes 30 seconds to ask \"How was your daughter's recital?\" or \"Did the kitchen renovation go well?\" But it creates deep rapport. The best part is that these behaviors compound. The more you use them, the more natural they become, and the more influence you build without even trying. Melody Wilding, LMSW is an executive coach, human behavior professor, and author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.\" Get her free training, 5 Steps to Speak Like a Senior Leader, here. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim during the Premier League match at Elland Road, Leeds. Picture date: Sunday January 4, 2026.Danny Lawson - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty ImagesEnglish soccer giant Manchester United has parted ways with head coach Ruben Amorim, just after he raised questions over his role at the club amid rumors of tensions with the club hierarchy. Appointed in November 2024, the 40-year-old had overseen one of the club's worst finishes in recent history last season, 15th out of 20 in the Premier League, the top division of English soccer.A statement from the club, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, said the move would \"give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"The stock was steady in premarket trading as of 7 a.m. ET, up around 0.1%.Amorim was Manchester United's first managerial appointment following billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake in the club in February 2024 from the Glazer family. Ratcliffe took an initial 27.7% stake, before ramping that up to 28.94% in December 2024, and has since assumed control of all football operations.Since the initial deal, worth $1.6 billion, Ratcliffe has also made a series of changes to the club's structure, hiring a new CEO and Director of Football.Speaking before his departure, Amorim hinted at frustrations over his role at the club following a draw with Leeds United on Sunday.\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months (when his contract expires) and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"The club is currently 6th in the Premier League.Manchester United said former player Darren Fletcher will lead the club in its next game against Burnley on Wednesday.",

(Photo by ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP via Getty Images)Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba announced on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed in combat during the U.S. raid on Venezuela.The raid on Saturday, which saw U.S. forces arrest and extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to New York, reportedly saw a large part of his security team killed. The Cubans were performing missions on behalf of the Cuban Armed Forces and interior ministry, the country's presidential office said on Facebook.\"Faithful to their responsibilities with security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroically and fell, after ferocious resistance, into direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,\" the statement said, according to a translation by Facebook. Cuba also called the U.S. strikes a \"criminal act of aggression and state terrorism,\" and said the Cuban government will pay tribute to the dead.The U.S. strikes came after weeks of military buildup in the region and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump against Maduro. After the raid, Trump said that the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela, \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. will use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims.\"We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction,\" Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.Seperately, Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that as the U.S. has a \"quaratine\" on Venezuelan oil. \"That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" he added.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean.— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland,\" Frederiksen said. \"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" she added. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on social media that Trump's remarks were \"very rude and disrespectful.\"'The Greenland risk is underpriced'Trump has long advocated for control over Greenland, a vast and sparsely populated territory rich in minerals that is strategically situated between Europe and North America. Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. Copenhagen has sought to improve ties with Greenland in recent months, pledging to boost spending for healthcare and infrastructure investments, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen attends a press conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 28, 2025. Nadja Wohlleben | ReutersMujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said the Danish government is in \"full crisis mode\" over Trump's latest comments, citing Frederiksen's statement over the weekend. \"As I've long argued, the Greenland risk is underpriced,\" Rahman said Sunday in a LinkedIn post. \"A possible US intervention in Greenland is now the biggest source of risk to the transatlantic alliance and intra-NATO and intra-EU cohesion, arguably far greater than those presented by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Rahman said.Read moreThe U.S. president, who has previously refused to rule out the use of military or economic force to take Greenland, named Louisiana Republican Gov.

    "body": "SpaceX headquarters is shown in Hawthorne, California, U.S. June 5, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersElon Musk's Starlink is offering free broadband internet service to users in Venezuela through Feb. 3, following U.S. airstrikes and the capture of ousted leader Nicolás Maduro. The satellite internet provider said in a release on Sunday that service credits were being added to both active and inactive accounts as it monitored evolving conditions. Starlink, a subsidiary of the aerospace company SpaceX, provides internet access via low-earth-orbit satellites and requires users to purchase separate equipment to connect to the service.While Starlink's availability map on its website lists Venezuela as \"coming soon,\" the company indicated that users can access the service through a roaming plan. \"While we do [not yet have] a timeline for local purchase availability, if and when there are updates they will be communicated directly through official Starlink channels,\" it added. It remains unclear how the company's services and pricing would evolve after Feb. 3. Nonetheless, a temporary extension of free internet services in the country could help provide connectivity amid the fallout of recent U.S. airstrikes and a ground raid to capture and extradite Maduro for trial on allegations including narco-terrorism and election rigging.  Starlink allows internet to be provided by non-state companies in authoritarian regimesMarko PapicGlobal GeoMacro Strategist at BCA ResearchWashington's operations on Jan. 3 mostly targeted areas in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, with the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira also attacked, according to a government statement.Following the airstrikes, reports indicated that areas of Caracas had lost power and internet connectivity. Some local outlets also reported outages in Miranda over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that the U.S. would oversee Venezuela's transition, though details remain unclear amid concerns over a power vacuum.The president also announced Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in after Maduro's arrest, but has threatened a second strike on Venezuela if the leadership didn't \"behave.\"Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council plans to hold a meeting on Jan. 6 to discuss the legality of U.S. action, as countries, including U.S. allies such as Brazil and Spain, have condemned the military actions.  Starlink's growing reach Venezuela is not the first conflict zone where Starlink has been deployed. The satellite service was rolled out in Ukraine in 2022 to replace internet and communication networks damaged by Russia's invasion of the country, quickly becoming a critical tool for both civilian and military connectivity.While Ukrainian and international officials praised Starlink's role in the war-torn country, its use in the conflict also raised questions about the influence a single private company could wield over access to internet services during wartime.These concerns escalated in September 2023 when a biography on Musk revealed that he had previously denied a Ukrainian request to activate Starlink coverage over Russian-annexed Crimea, effectively thwarting a planned drone submarine attack.This disclosure prompted the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee to probe \"serious national liability issues\" stemming from a private citizen's sway over the conflict.However, in June 2023, the U.S. Department of Defense brought Starlink's activities in Ukraine under its formal oversight through a contract with SpaceX, effectively making the company an official military contractor.The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment regarding potential involvement or oversight of Starlink's operations in Venezuela. Beyond conflict zones, Starlink has also been used to bypass government-imposed internet censorship and shutdowns in several countries.In Iran, thousands of users have reportedly used Starlink to access the unfiltered internet, defying government restrictions despite the service not being officially approved.Venezuela also has a well-documented history of internet censorship and shutdowns, especially during times of political upheaval under the governments of Hugo Chávez and Maduro. \"Starlink allows internet to be provided by non-state companies in authoritarian regimes,\" Marko Papic, Global GeoMacro Strategist at BCA Research,  told CNBC, adding that this is almost certain to become a trend. It is highly likely that Starlink will become available everywhere where the U.S. is involved in an antagonistic relationship with the regime, he added. However, amid broader international concerns over Starlink and the U.S.'s dominant role in the satellite broadband sector, governments such as China and the European Union have been supporting domestic alternatives. That includes Shanghai-based Qianfan, also known as SpaceSail, which has launched at least 108 low-earth-orbit satellites so far, according to Chinese state-backed media.Meanwhile, Beijing's state-owned space program last month announced the successful launch of its 17th batch of low-Earth-orbit internet satellites under its Guowang constellation project.

    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (L) and China's President Xi Jinping wave during a meeting in Miraflores Presidential Palace, in Caracas on July 2",
    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (L) and China's President Xi Jinping wave during a meeting in Miraflores Presidential Palace, in Caracas on July 20, 2014.Leo Ramirez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ancient Greek historian Thucydides once wrote that \"the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\" On Jan. 3, the United States appeared to echo that maxim when it launched strikes on Venezuela and, in a lightning raid, arrested President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.The couple was flown to New York to face drug and terrorism charges, drawing sharp criticism from foreign governments about the legality of the attack. The operation also reignited debate over whether Washington is reviving a world where might makes right. David Roche of Quantum Strategy told CNBC the operation could weaken U.S. arguments against similar actions by rivals.\"If Donald Trump can walk into a country and take it over… then why is Putin wrong about Ukraine, and why is China not entitled to take over Taiwan?\" Roche said.The U.S. has asserted what it calls a \"Trump Corollary\" in its recently released National Security Strategy, reviving the Monroe Doctrine of the 1820s, where the U.S. had a sphere of influence over the so-called \"Western Hemisphere.\"A sphere of influence refers to a region where a powerful country seeks to dominate political, military or economic decisions without formally annexing territory.The concept echoes the Roosevelt Corollary, which historically justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.A statement from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,\" calling the developments in Venezuela a \"dangerous precedent.\"Roche warned the action could create unintended consequences. \"On one hand, you've created a series of threats, and on the other, you've created a series of permissions to every dictatorial, autocratic regime, who wants to act to take over territory which is not currently within its ambit.\"The Taiwan questionIn Asia, attention has turned to whether China could be emboldened to increase pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.China staged live-fire drills around Taiwan in December, framing them as a warning against foreign interference. In his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared Taiwan's unification \"unstoppable,\" echoing U.S. intelligence assessments that Beijing could attempt to seize the island by force within this decade.Ryan Hass, a former U.S. diplomat and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against drawing direct parallels. \"There will be an impulse among foreign policy analysts to draw analogies to Taiwan and to warn about Trump setting a precedent Beijing could use against Taiwan. I would caution against that impulse,\" he  wrote on X.Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), Chinese President Xi Jinping (R), Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (L) and other leaders lay flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2015 in Moscow, Russia.Sasha Mordovets | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHass said China has avoided direct military action against Taiwan, not out of deference for international law or norms, but has instead relied on a strategy of coercion short of violence.\"Beijing will be more focused on protecting its interests, condemning US actions, and sharpening the contrast with the US in the international system than it will be on drawing inspiration from today's events to alter its approach on Taiwan,\" Hass wrote. China's foreign ministry, in a statement after the strike, said it was \"deeply shocked by and strongly condemns the U.S.'s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president.\"Beijing called the strike a  \"hegemonic act\" and called on Washington to \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security.\"\"The Trump administration, more so than any American administration in recent memory, is comfortable with great powers like China and Russia having a sphere of influence,\" said Marko Papic, chief strategist of macro-geopolitical at BCA Research. However, it does not mean that Washington is okay with these countries expanding their orbits, he added.Moreover, there does not seem to be an \"abandonment\" of Taiwan by the Trump administration, Papic told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\", pointing to the $11 billion arms sale that was announced by Taiwan in December. The U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to providing weapons necessary for Taiwan's self-defense.Rules for thee, not for meEvan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued the U.S. would likely pursue its own sphere of influence while denying one to China.\"The United States is NOT going to 'consent' to a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia,\" Feigenbaum wrote on X. \"Instead, I suspect it will attempt to insist on an American sphere of influence in its own Hemisphere while trying to deny one to China in Asia.\"\"Let's not pretend the U.S. is consistent and that contradiction and hypocrisy in U.S. foreign policy aren't a thing,\" he added in a separate post.BCA Research's Papic said that time was on China's side, and added it did not have to immediately act on Taiwan, while the U.S. is likely to focus on its \"Western Hemisphere.\"\"Why risk getting the entire Western world to unite against [China] by effectively trying to militarily reunify with Taiwan in January of 2026? Why risk it when time is likely on China's side over the next 10 years, as the U.S. continues to focus on the near abroad, and less so on the entire world.\"— CNBC's Chery Kang, Martin Soong and Amitoj Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Amazon Ireland corporate offices in Dublin, as Amazon.com, Inc., said on Tuesday it plans to cut its global corporate workforce by as many as 14,000 roles and seize the opportunity provided by artificial intelligence (AI), in Dublin, Ireland, Oct. 28, 2025. Damien Eagers | ReutersValuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending.Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonThis week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\"Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a price forecast of $300. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240.The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending.Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with Alphabet-owned Google expanding more gradually, and Meta Platforms lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage.Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%. See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.MicrosoftLet's look at another tech giant, Microsoft (MSFT). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $650. The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562.\"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss.Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises.Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead.Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market.Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See Microsoft Technology Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Micron TechnologyMemory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers.Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a price target of $300. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285.Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\"Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25.The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate.Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%. See Micron Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a press conference following a U.S. strike on Venezuela where President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 3, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Trump administration is facing renewed questions over its recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and charged him with crimes related to drug trafficking.  Hernandez in 2024 was convicted of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Hernandez in November, saying in a post to his Truth Social account that he had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, along with four other charges: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday was pressed on the apparent contradiction of Hernandez' pardon now that the U.S. is seeking similar charges against Maduro, another head of state of a South American nation with ties to the drug trade. \"I don't do the pardon file, I'm not against it or for it, I didn't review the file, so I can't speak to you about the dynamics that led the president to make the decision that he made,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He reviewed the file, he went through the arguments in it and he felt that the former president of Honduras was treated very unfairly by the previous administration,\" Rubio said. Rubio said that \"whether you agree with that decision or not ... that doesn't mean you leave Maduro in place.\"\"The answer to that, whether you have a problem with it or not, is not to leave in play someone who has been indicted who hasn't even faced American justice yet,\" Rubio said. Trump's pardon of Hernandez was already under intense scrutiny before Maduro's ouster. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the \"hypocrisy underlying this decision is especially glaring.\"\"This same president recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, including conspiring with narcotics traffickers while in office,\" Warner said. \"Yet now, the administration claims that similar allegations justify the use of military force against another sovereign nation. You cannot credibly argue that drug trafficking charges demand invasion in one case, while issuing a pardon in another.\"At a press conference on Saturday after Maduro's capture, Trump was pressed on the pardon. He said Hernandez was \"persecuted very unfairly.\" \"He was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,\" Trump said, referring to his own criminal prosecutions for allegedly hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election after leaving office following his first term as president. Trump also cited his endorsement of Nasry Asfura, the president-elect of Honduras, as another reason for the pardon. \"He's also a party member of the man who won, so obviously the people liked what I did,\" Trump said. \"And one of the reasons that was done is because of the fact that the party in power felt very strongly that that man was treated very badly.\"Trump also gestured at Rubio and other members of his national security team when explaining why he issued the pardon. \"I went to a lot of the people standing behind me, and they felt that that man was persecuted and treated very badly,\" he said.

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump made clear Saturday that U.S. investment in oil-rich Venezuela's energy sector is a central objective of the regime change operation that ousted President Nicolas Maduro.\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\" Trump said in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\"Let's start making money for the country,\" Trump said.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or 17% of global reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company operating in the South American nation. It exported about 140,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. U.S. forces captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a large-scale attack on the South American nation overnight.

CNBC has reached out to Exxon Mobil for further comment. Trump said the U.S. will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" The president said the U.S. will temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group,\" without providing details.A crude oil tanker is anchored on Lake Maracaibo near Maracaibo, Zulia state, Venezuela, on December 18, 2025. Alejandro Paredes | Afp | Getty ImagesThe overthrow of Maduro comes after a monthslong U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. Trump said the embargo he imposed on Venezuelan oil \"remains in full effect.\" The president said oil companies will pay directly for the cost of rebuilding Venezuela's crude infrastructure. \"They will be reimbursed for what they're doing,\" Trump said.\"We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" he said. \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil to other countries, many of whom are using it now, but I would say many more will come,\" he said.

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesVenezuela's production peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s, but has declined significantly since then, said Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler. The country's current production stands at around 800,000 barrels per day, according to Kpler data. Comparatively, for the week of Dec. 26, the U.S. produced around 13.8 million barrels per day.China and Russia have a presence in Venezuela's oil sector, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. The Maduro regime in November approved a 15-year extension of joint ventures with Russian-linked companies operating fields in Venezuela, Lipow said. Lipow said Venezuela's oil exports could come to a complete halt since it is unclear who is in charge in the capital city of Caracas, with buyers likely unsure to whom they should send money. Chevron will likely continuing exporting, mitigating any supply impact, Lipow said. \"I do wonder about the security (or lack thereof) situation on the ground and how it could impact oil production facilities, infrastructure, and exports,\" the analyst said in a Saturday note to clients. Kpler analyst Smith said an oversupplied oil market \"will help cushion the blow of any further supply disruptions.\" The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. Global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%. The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. has also produced at record levels. ",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

(Photo by Jair F. Coll/Getty Images)Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesMarkets are weighing whether the Venezuela episode marks a turning point in how political power is priced into assets, or whether it will become another headline shock that fades quickly from portfolios.Gold prices advanced over 2% to $4,419 per ounce on Monday, while the dollar firmed modestly. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, strengthened around 0.2% to 98.662.Other market levers remain relatively muted. U.S. Treasury yields are little changed, with yields on the 10-year and 2-year relatively unchanged at 4.187% and 3.475%, respectively. The MSCI All Country World Index, a measure of global stock market performance, inched up 0.48%.\"While the headlines are unsettling, the market response so far has been notably restrained,\" said Jung In Yun, founder and CEO of Fibonacci Asset Management, adding that the movements so far reflect \"modest hedging rather than flight-to-safety.\"Investors are eyeing a handful of signals as they try to distinguish between headline shock and economic transmission. 1. Oil market structure, not spot pricesThe first test of whether the developments in Venezuela matter systemically for the markets is not where oil trades today, but how the market is structured.\"The key here is whether the oil market supply tightens,\" said Billy Leung, senior investment strategist at Global X ETFs. \"As long as Brent trades around US$60 and the forward curve remains in contango, the market is signalling ample supply and limited concern about disruption from Venezuela. \"A shift toward backwardation would indicate that this is becoming a real supply issue rather than a headline event. Which is not happening right now.\"watch nowWhen a crisis truly threatens oil supply, buyers usually rush to secure barrels immediately, pushing near-term prices above future prices. That creates a market structure known as backwardation, and it's a classic sign of scarcity or panic. Until the oil curve tightens, investors do not see developments in Venezuela as a threat to the global energy system.That message is echoed across the energy complex. Venezuela produces roughly 1 million barrels a day, which amounts to around 1% of global supply. Additionally, key infrastructure has remained operational. OPEC+ has paused supply hikes, inventories are ample, and global surplus conditions continue to dominate pricing, other energy experts noted.As Norbert Rücker, head of economics and next generation research at Julius Baer, puts it: \"We believe that these events pose minimal near-term supply risks and thus offer minimal chances of a meaningful oil price bounce… The oil market appears to be in a lasting surplus.\"2. Volatility pricingAnother clear sign of market complacency is volatility — or rather, the lack thereof. The Volatility Index, which tracks expected volatility in the U.S. equity market for the next 30 days, currently stands at 14.5.The figure is well below stress levels and far from the 50+ spike seen during last year's tariff shocks, Leung noted. The VIX serves as a forward-looking indicator of market fear and uncertainty, with a higher VIX pointing to increased uncertainty and stress, and a falling VIX connoting otherwise.\"That tells you markets are not paying up for protection despite elevated geopolitical headlines,\" Leung said.  Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, similarly noted that markets are \"waiting to see what happens next. So the initial reaction is relatively muted.\"3. U.S. real yields and credit spreadsIf Venezuela was triggering a broader repricing of risk, it would show up in falling bond yields and rising inflation expectations — none of which is happening, according to market watchers.So far, real yields remain elevated, which partly reflects the U.S.' heavy debt burden. Inflation expectations are also stable, suggesting no meaningful change in the growth or inflation outlook, Leung said.Investors are also watching credit markets, which often flag stress earlier than equities. \"Credit markets tend to price stress earlier, sometimes better, than equities,\" Leung said. \"High yield and emerging market sovereign spreads are the key indicators to watch. Venezuelan bonds themselves are not informative, as they are already deeply distressed and largely irrelevant for global risk pricing.\"4. Other safe havensGold has been the main beneficiary of developments in Venezuela, following a streak of record highs in 2025. Similarly, silver prices have advanced over 3% to $75.2733 per ounce.\"This suggests a knee-jerk increase in the pricing of geopolitical risks,\" said Steve Brice, global chief investment officer at Standard Chartered. The bank expects gold prices to hit $4,800 per ounce this year. \"If anything, these developments might expedite this appreciation,\" he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold COMEXWhile gold tends to do well when other assets do badly, it performs best \"when people lose faith in the way the world works,\" said BullionVault's Adrian Ash, director of research. \"Trump's return to the White House has ripped up the underlying structures, alliances and rules which Western business and capital thought they could rely on.\"5. Spillovers into other flashpointsThe longer-term risk is not Venezuela itself, but whether the episode changes political behavior in other parts of the world.Yardeni noted that Venezuela adds to an already crowded list of flashpoints, including the Middle East, the Ukraine war, and China-Taiwan tensions. \"So far, those risks haven't stopped the global bull market in stocks,\" he said, though they have helped fuel gains in precious metals.The longer-term risk is whether this sets a precedent that affects behaviour elsewhere, particularly around Taiwan, Leung said. \"Markets will focus less on political rhetoric and more on whether this episode changes actions by other major powers.\"watch nowThere has been some chatter following the Venezuela intervention that a deal could exist between Beijing and Washington that would see Taiwan \"traded\" for Venezuela. A China-Taiwan military reunification is not imminent at this point in time, said Marko Papic, chief GeoMacro strategist at BCA Research.\"The U.S. has recently both transferred a significant number of weapons to Taiwan and included it as a \"red line\" in its relations with China in the most recent National Security Strategy,\" he said.For now, most investors see the developments in Venezuela as a tactical shock, rather than a regime shift for markets.\"At this stage, the price action points to a temporary geopolitical risk premium rather than a structural shift,\" added Fibonacci Asset Management's Jung.",

Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

    "body": "The oil tanker \"Minerva Astra\" lies at anchor in Maracaibo, Venezuela, as protester with the Venezuelan flag approaches the vessel Dec. 17, 2002.Andrew Alvarez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe arrest of Nicolás Maduro has thrown one of the world's most politically fraught oil industries back into focus, forcing investors to reassess who controls Venezuela's crude resources and whether they can be meaningfully revived after decades of decline.For now, the answer may seem straightforward. \"Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-owned oil company, controls the majority of the oil production and reserves,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. American energy corporation Chevron operates in the country through its own production and a joint venture with PDVSA, while Russian and Chinese firms also participate through partnerships, though \"majority control is still with PDVSA,\" Lipow said. If Trump is successful in seeing a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government take shape in Venezuela, Chevron is best placed [to control Venezuelan oil] given the are already well positioned there.Saul KavonicMST FinancialVenezuela nationalized its oil industry in the 1970s, which led to the creation of PDVSA. Oil output peaked at about 3.5 million barrels per day in 1997, but has since plunged to an estimated 950,000 barrels per day, with around 550,000 barrels per day exported, data provided by Lipow Oil Associates showed.If a more pro-U.S. and pro-investment government takes shape in Venezuela, Chevron would be \"best placed\" to expand its role, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial. European companies like Repsol and Eni could also benefit, given their existing positions in Venezuela, he said.What it means for global oilAny regime change could disrupt the commercial chain that keeps Venezuelan barrels flowing, industry experts warned.\"Since it is unclear at this time who is in charge in Venezuela, we might see exports completely halt as the buyers don't know to whom to send the money,\" said Lipow. He added that the latest round of U.S. sanctions on a shadow fleet of tankers has severely affected exports, forcing Venezuela to cut production.The shadow fleet refers to tankers that operate outside traditional shipping, insurance and regulatory systems to move crude from sanctioned countries. These vessels are commonly used to transport oil from nations such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, which face U.S. restrictions on energy exports.Lipow expects Chevron to continue exporting 150,000 barrels per day, limiting any immediate supply impact. Still, he said the broader uncertainty could add a short-term risk premium of about $3 per barrel.That bump would come against a market that many analysts see as adequately supplied, at least for now. \"The oil market currently is trending towards oversupply,\" Rapidan Energy Group's Bob McNally said, calling the immediate impact \"almost a nothing burger.\" Venezuela's longer-term importance lies in the type of oil it produces. The country's heavy, sour crude can be technically challenging to extract, but prized by complex refineries, particularly in the U.S. \"American refineries... love to slurp that gunky oil from Venezuela and Canada,\" McNally said.\"The real issues are, will the oil industry be able to get back into Venezuela and reverse two decades of dilapidation and neglect and get it back up?\"If a new government led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is installed very quickly, sanctions could ease and oil exports could initially rise as stored oil is used to generate revenue, Lipow said. However, a short-term surge could pressure prices, he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past one yearStill, any notion of a sustained recovery faces hard physical limits. \"The Venezuelan oil industry is in such a state of disrepair that even with a change in government, it is unlikely to see any material increase in oil production for years as substantial investments are required to rehabilitate the existing infrastructure,\" he noted.Similarly, RBC's Helima Croft warned that the path to recovery is long, citing Venezuela's \"decades-long decline under the Chávez and Maduro regimes.\" She said that oil executives contend it will cost at least $10 billion annually to turn the sector around, with \"a stable security environment\" an absolute prerequisite.\"All bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,\" she said.— CNBC's Chery Kang and Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

Bookings grew 19% year over year to $5.07 billion, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. Net income totaled about $2.76 billion, or $6.72 per share. The company said it expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability, to range between $120 million and $140 million in the current quarter. Analysts expected $139.8 million for the current period.Lyft said that recent legislation, which cut insurance costs in California, contributed to lower rideshare prices.\"While we expect this to drive increased demand over time, broad-based consumer adoption will take time to materialize and we now anticipate this being back-half weighted,\" the company said in a release. Lyft posted lackluster ride metrics for the fourth quarter. Active riders totaled 29.2 million during the period and came up short of a StreetAccount estimate of 29.5 million. Rides totaled 243.5 million, versus a FactSet estimate of 256.6 million.The company's board also approved up to $1 billion in additional share buybacks.Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

Here's how the artificial intelligence infrastructure and semiconductor company did compared to LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $271 million vs. $250 million expectedRevenue in the fourth quarter rose 92% year over year. However, some analysts were expecting the company to report revenue in excess of $280 million for the period.Astera Labs reported $45 million in net income for the quarter, an 82% increase from $24.7 million the year before. The company said it expects first-quarter revenue to come between $286 million and $297 million, higher than Wall Street expectations of $259 million.\"We started the company eight years ago to really service the cloud and AI infrastructure space,\" Astera Labs CEO Jitendra Mohan told CNBC on Tuesday. \"And fortunately for us, the space is on fire.\"Mohan attributed the earnings beat to growth in its Scorpio fabric switch and its Taurus ethernet cables, which accounted for 30% of total revenue collectively.\"Increasingly, the bottleneck is shifting from compute to connectivity, and connectivity is where we play,\" Mohan said. \"So it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to grow and beat the overall market growth rate in the AI space.\"In addition to reporting earnings, the company also announced that finance chief Mike Tate will be stepping down. Desmond Lynch, currently the finance chief at semiconductor company Rambus, will replace Tate, effective March 2. Tate will remain at Astera Labs as a strategic advisor to the CEO.Additionally, Astera Labs on Tuesday said it had issued a new warrant for Amazon to buy about $466 million in the chip company's stock. Amazon owned $43 million in Astera Labs shares as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.Astera Labs also announced a research and development center in Israel on Monday.\"We are really bottlenecked by the availability of resources more than anything else,\" Mohan said. \"So opening a design center in Israel is one step towards getting access to the talent pool that is available.\"Astera Labs was founded by former Texas Instruments executives in 2017. The company went public in 2024, and has inked deals with Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Amazon as customers of its chips.-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this reportWATCH: AI is still in the early stages of development, says Astera Labs CEO watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmericans ended 2025 more in debt than ever before.Credit card balances hit a fresh high in the fourth quarter, rising by $44 billion to $1.28 trillion, according to a new report on household debt by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released Tuesday. That's a 5.5% jump from a year earlier. The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, released Monday, also found that fewer consumers expect their households' financial situations to be better off a year from now — and a larger share expect to be worse off.'Evidence consistent with a K-shaped economy'Julpo | E+ | Getty ImagesNear the end of the year, credit card debt often ticks higher as consumers increase their spending during the peak holiday shopping season. \"Given what we are seeing in the labor market, spending is holding up quite well,\" the New York Fed researchers said on a press call Tuesday. Even as the job market shows signs of strain, consumer spending has largely stayed strong. However, that has been attributed to robust buying by higher-end consumers, other research shows.\"You see evidence consistent with a 'K-shaped' economy,\" the New York Fed researchers said. \"Some groups are really struggling.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsFollowing Super Bowl ad, Trump accounts launch a new sign-up optionSome student loan borrowers wait over a year for public servant debt forgivenessTrump's 'big beautiful bill' may spur the rise of 'un-college,' experts sayFirst the quarter zip, now a '401(k) mullet' — what trends say about the economyHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

Currently, about 175 million people in the U.S. have credit cards, and while some pay their bills in full each month, roughly 60% of credit card users carry a balance from one month to the next, according to the New York Fed. President Donald Trump's call for a temporary 10% cap on credit cards, could mean significantly lower interest rate charges for those with revolving debt. Yet, banks and industry executives have said they would fight credit card price controls, just as they successfully fought the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's efforts to cap card late fees last year.More than half, 55%, of consumers carry credit card balances to cover essential expenses, according to a separate report by debt management company Achieve released Monday.Among those falling behind, many have had to choose between keeping up with debt payments and covering everyday necessities, the survey of 2,000 consumers found.\"This is what the K-shaped economy looks like in the real world. There's an affluent half of the population whose financial lives aren't disrupted by momentary inconveniences. But for everyone else, financial triage and tradeoffs are a way of life,\" Andrew Housser, Achieve's co-founder and co-CEO, said in a statement. \"The longer this persists, the more the gap widens,\" he added.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "2026 Ford Mustang Dark Horse SC on display during the Media Preview of the 2026 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place on February 6, 2026, in Chicago, Illinois.Jacek Boczarski | Anadolu | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Ford Motor reported its largest quarterly earnings miss in four years in its fourth-quarter results released Tuesday, while guiding for 2026 to be a rebound year for the automaker.Ford's 2026 guidance includes adjusted EBIT of between $8 billion and $10 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year; adjusted free cash flow of between $5 billion and $6 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2025; and capital expenditures of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion, up from $8.8 billion.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 13 cents adjusted vs. 19 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $41.83 billion expectedThe EPS coming in 32% below consensus was the company's first quarterly miss since 2024 and its worst since a 42% difference when reporting its 2021 fourth-quarter results, according to LSEG.The earnings miss was largely due to unexpected tariff costs of roughly $900 million related to credits for auto parts not taking effect as early as expected, the company said. Ford, as of Dec. 15, had confirmed $7.7 billion in earnings before interest and taxes for the fourth quarter, but the additional costs dropped that to $6.8 billion.Ford CFO Sherry House said the lower-than-expected earnings were also related to additional impacts from fires at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant last year in New York, which now isn't expected to be fully operational until the middle of this year. The plant supplies Ford's lucrative F-Series pickup trucks.\"We will see a billion-dollar benefit roughly in 2026; however, this year, due to the Novelis impact, we're going to have tariffs increasing in order to secure aluminum that is roughly the same amount of that savings,\" House told reporters.Ford's net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year at $2 billion in 2026, she said. The Novelis fire had an impact of $2 billion during the second half of the year for Ford, she added.House and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's 2025 results continue to demonstrate the company's underlying business is improving despite the special items impacting results.The company's 2025 revenue was a record $187.3 billion, up 1% from $185 billion a year earlier. That includes $45.9 billion during the fourth quarter, down 5% from a year before.On a business unit level, the automaker's traditional and fleet operations are expected to offset an expected $4 billion to $4.5 billion in losses this year for its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit. Pre-tax earnings from its \"Ford Pro\" fleet business are expected to be between $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, followed by $4 billion to $4.5 billion for its traditional \"Blue\" business.On an unadjusted basis, the company's net loss of $8.2 billion last year was its largest since the Great Recession in 2008, according to FactSet. That included $15.5 billion in special charges during the fourth quarter largely related to a pre-announced pullback in its all-electric vehicle plans.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion, or a loss of $2.77 per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the same period in 2024. Adjusted for the one-time charges, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share.",

    "body": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA referral by former Trump campaign lawyer Kurt Olsen led to the recent FBI raid that seized 2020 election ballots from a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center, a newly unsealed federal court document revealed Tuesday.The document, an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, said that the FBI is conducting a \"criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties\" alleged to have occurred in voting processes and ballot counting in Fulton County in 2020 \"were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws.\"\"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity,\" the affidavit document in U.S. District Court in Atlanta says.Olsen worked on efforts after the 2020 election to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in that contest to former President Joe Biden.Evans' affidavit was submitted by federal prosecutors as part of an application asking a federal magistrate judge to sign a search warrant for the election center. Olsen reportedly was hired last fall to investigate election issues.The affidavit was ordered unsealed by Atlanta federal court Judge J.P. Boulee, who was nominated by Trump, after the chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and county Board of Registration and Elections sued the federal government over the seizure of the ballots and sought their return.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the election center on Jan. 28 when FBI agents raided the site and seized ballots.Gabbard's presence and the raid itself have been strongly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others concerned that President Donald Trump is undercutting confidence in the upcoming midterm elections while resurrecting long-discredited claims that he actually won the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Gabbard has said was at the election center at the direction of Trump. The president, in turn, has said that Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.On Tuesday, two Democratic senators, Alex Padilla of California and Virginia's Mark Warner, called on Gabbard to immediately schedule an intelligence community briefing for senators on election security concerns ahead of the midterm elections.\"The request comes amid unprecedented investigations by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), purportedly to address 'evidence' of election vulnerabilities and manipulation of election results, which have not been substantiated,\" the senators' offices said in a statement.The warrant signed by the magistrate judge in Georgia authorized the FBI to seize all physical ballots from the 2020 general election in Fulton County, including absentee ballots; tabulator tapes for every voting machine; and the vote rolls from the county.The affidavit signed by Evans, the FBI agent, says, \"Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia.\"\"Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County,\" Evans wrote.The agent said the investigation is focused on several \"deficiencies or defects with the\" 2020 election and tabulation of votes.\"The tabulator machines used by Fulton County are designed to create and save a scanned image of each ballot,\" Evans wrote. \"Fulton County has admitted that it does not have scanned images of all the 528,777 ballots counted during the Original Count or the 527,925 ballots counted during the Recount.\"\"Fulton County has confirmed that during the Recount of votes, some ballots were scanned multiple times,\" the agent wrote. \"Ballot images made available in response to public record requests show ballots with unique markings duplicated within the ballot images.\"Evans also said that auditors who counted votes by hand reported vote tallies that were inconsistent with the actual number of votes within a batch, and that Fulton County reported two different vote tallies on the deadline to report recount results and on the subsequent day.\"If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race,\" the affidavit said.",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) speaks after departing federal court on Feb. 3, 2026 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., declined a request by prosecutors to indict two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Michigan's Elissa Slotkin, on charges of seditious conspiracy, MS Now reported Tuesday night.The attempted indictment of Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and the former CIA analyst Slotkin related to a video in November that they made with four other Democrats in Congress, on which they reminded members of the U.S. military that they have the right to refuse to follow illegal orders by superiors. The video was released on social media in response to ongoing extrajudicial killings by the U.S. military of crews of boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that allegedly were carrying narcotics.The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors also tried and failed to obtain indictments against the other four Democrats, in addition to Kelly and Slotkin. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, who is a former Navy reservist, and Rep. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, a Navy veteran, later indicated they were among the six reportedly targeted in the indictment effort.The other two Democrats who made the video were Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, who was an Army Ranger, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who is a former Air Force officer.It is extremely unusual for a grand jury to refuse to issue an indictment when a prosecutor seeks one. An indictment is a charging document that a grand jury will issue if jurors agree there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed.President Donald Trump had condemned the Democrats for the video after it was made public on Nov. 18.Trump at the time accused them of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social then.Kelly, who is also a former NASA astronaut, blasted the effort to indict him.\"This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies,\" Kelly said in a post on X on Tuesday.\"It wasn't enough for [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime — all because of something I said that they didn't like. That's not the way,\" Kelly said.Kelly is suing the Pentagon to challenge its censure of him and its effort to reduce his rank because of his participation in the video.Slotkin, in a statement, said, \"Today, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro attempted to persuade a Grand Jury to indict me. This was in response to me organizing a 90-second video that simply quoted the law.\"\"Pirro did this at the direction of President Trump, who said repeatedly that I should be investigated, arrested, and hanged for sedition,\" Slotkin said. \"Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed. Hopefully, this ends this politicized investigation for good.\"\"But today wasn't just an embarrassing day for the Administration. It was another sad day for our country,\" she said.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday night that he believes the six Democrats who made the video on illegal orders to the military should be indicted.Goodlander, in a statement, said, \"President Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate me, arrest me, and hang me simply for doing my job.\"\"Today an American grand jury honored our Constitution by standing up to an outrageous abuse of presidential power and taxpayer dollars,\" Goodlander said. \"No matter the threats, I will keep doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution.\"Deluzio, in a statement, said, \"I will not be intimidated for a single second by the Trump Administration or Justice Department lawyers who tried and failed to indict me today. American citizens on a grand jury refused to go along with this attempt to charge me with a crime for stating the law in a way Trump and his enablers didn't like.\"\"They may want Americans to be afraid to speak out or to disagree — but patriotism demands courage in this moment. DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP!\" Deluzio said.",

    "body": "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) speaks with reporters as the House votes to end the partial government shutdown on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026.Kylie Cooper | ReutersHouse Republican leaders suffered a loss on a procedural vote Tuesday as fellow GOP lawmakers balked at voting to block challenges to President Donald Trump's tariffs through the summer. The GOP rebellion on the vote, which failed 214-217, highlights divisions among House Republicans, a dynamic that could make it even harder for Speaker Mike Johnson,, R-La., to advance his and Trump's agenda through a narrowly divided Congress. Dissatisfied factions within the House GOP have revolted several times this Congress, forcing the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and supporting a failed Democratic effort to extend Obamacare subsidies.Johnson could only afford to lose one Republican on the measure, which would also have set the rules for debate on a bill to boost domestic production of critical minerals. Three Republicans joined every Democrat to defeat the rule.If they choose to continue pursuing the tariff language, GOP leaders will now need to go back to the House Rules Committee and attach it to a new rule.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a perennial thorn in the side of GOP leadership, was one of the Republicans to oppose the rule, along with Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Don Bacon of Nebraska, as frustration over Trump's tariffs and leadership's maneuvering percolates within the Republican ranks.Kiley told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he objects to \"this idea that everyone needs to stick together to bring a particular bill on the floor\" because it makes the House \"less of a democratic body.\" \"Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It's time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility,\" Bacon posted to X after the vote. The vote was originally slated for early afternoon, but House Republicans rescheduled it for Tuesday night.Johnson earlier on Tuesday said he expected the measure to pass and that the rationale for the vote this week was \"to allow the Supreme Court to rule on the pending case.\" The Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge to Trump's tariffs with a ruling pending following oral arguments last November.\"That process has been playing out. I think it's logical to allow that to continue. The president's trade policies have been a great benefit to the country,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The House Rules Committee on Monday approved language that would block any House votes disapproving of Trump's tariffs through July 31. House Democrats had already planned to force a vote disapproving of Trump's tariffs this week.\"It is no secret that in private many Republican members of Congress have concerns with President Trump's tariff policies. Now some are even voicing their concerns in public,\" the House Rules Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said at Monday's hearing.\"They were just about to have the chance to vote this week to end them. So what's this all about? The White House is scared. They know that the Republican House finally, after months of blocking itself from doing what the Senate has already done, is poised to vote to end these unpopular, unwise, downright dumb tariffs,\" McGovern continued.The Senate has on multiple occasions voted to strike down tariffs issued by Trump, while the House has blocked votes on tariff-related resolutions. The latest prohibition on tariff votes expired at the end of January.For Tuesday's vote, some other Republicans expressed their discomfort with tariffs, but ultimately voted in favor of the rule.\"The Supreme Court is going to be deciding this issue by June. So there is an argument to be made to maintain the status quo until then,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"I believe in free trade. And tariffs are a big mistake. But given that the Supreme Court's about to weigh in, maybe we ought to just keep our powder dry and see what they say,\" said McClintock, who supported the rule.— CNBC's Karen Sloan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff participates in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2026.Chris J. Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOver 1,400 Salesforce employees have signed a letter calling on CEO Marc Benioff to drop potential business with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, two people familiar with the effort told CNBC.\"We are deeply troubled by recent press reports describing Salesforce pitches of AI technology to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to help the agency 'expeditiously' hire 10,000 new agents and vet tip-line reports,\" the letter reads.The letter calls on Benioff to cancel \"all active pitches or 'opportunities' for ICE enforcement and hiring\" and issue a public statement demanding the removal of masked agents in U.S. cities.The Salesforce employee letter is the latest example of tech workers raising concerns about the U.S. agency's use of their companies' services after ICE agents killed U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota in January.Earlier on Tuesday, Benioff joked about ICE being present at an employee gathering in Las Vegas, 404 Media reported. The incident led employees to criticize the comments in an internal Slack forum, the two people told CNBC.Letter signatories are asking Salesforce to tell workers what kinds of services it is providing to ICE and \"pause or prohibit infrastructure, AI systems or services that enable ICE operational scale-up.\"\"We are concerned that Salesforce products and services may be enabling ICE to expand recruitment, onboarding and operational capacity,\" reads a supplementary document to the letter, which CNBC viewed. The document cited an October New York Times report saying that Salesforce described its software as an \"ideal platform\" for ICE agent recruitment in a response to a request for information.The letter from employees comes at a difficult time for the company. Investors have been concerned about the possibility of AI models hurting the growth prospects of software companies, including Salesforce. Its stock is down about 27% so far in 2026. In December, the company touted its work with the U.S. government and called for growth between 9% and 10% in the current fiscal year, which would be up slightly.Wired reported about the letter earlier Tuesday. Salesforce did not immediately provide comment.watch nowThe letter from Salesforce employees comes after 900 Google employees asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection as of last week. Business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook have also decried the behavior of ICE agents in clashes with protesters. \"Employees face real personal and professional risk when Salesforce is perceived as enabling ICE, including reputational harm, social targeting or being misidentified as complicit in activities they oppose,\" the supplement reads. \"At the same time, employees cannot make informed decisions about their work when the scope, governance and boundaries of Salesforce's relationship with ICE are opaque.\"Organizers plan to send the letter to Benioff by Friday, according to the document. The letter credits Benioff for saying in October that he did not believe the National Guard needed to deploy to San Francisco, where Salesforce has its headquarters and holds its annual Dreamforce conference. One week earlier, The New York Times reported that Benioff supported President Donald Trump's idea of bringing troops to the city. In May, the U.S. General Services Administration said Salesforce offered discounts on Slack, its team communication software, to a slew of government agencies. Adobe, Microsoft and ServiceNow also extended price cuts for use of their software across the U.S. government.In October, Benioff held a conversation with Trump's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, and in November, the Salesforce CEO attended a dinner with the president at the White House alongside other technology executives. He posted a photo of himself with Attorney General Pam Bondi on X.\"Marc, you have often said that 'business is the greatest platform for change,'\" the letter reads. \"Today, that platform must be used to defend our neighbors' constitutional rights and the safety of our communities.\"",

    "body": "A 'now hiring' sign is displayed in a business's window in Manhattan on Jan. 9, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe jobs report Wednesday will give markets a lot to consider, as investors parse through fresh data and a batch of revisions. Economists expect that January's nonfarm payrolls report will show growth that was nil or not much better during the month. On top of that, annual revisions also could reveal that the U.S. economy going back to early 2024 had generated few if any net jobs, casting further doubt on the health of the labor market.\"I think zero would be the forecast,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The consensus is probably around 50,000. Anything around zero just shows you how fragile things are, just very weak. This is all happening with no layoffs, but layoffs are going to pick up. I think we could get job losses here pretty soon.\"The payrolls report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It was delayed five days due to the brief government shutdown.watch nowOfficially, the Dow Jones consensus forecast is calling for payroll gains of 55,000, a number that has been trending lower and would come after a December increase of 50,000. That is expected to be good enough to keep the unemployment rate at a still-low 4.4%, with annual wage gains of 3.7%.However, a number of Wall Street economists are predicting a below-forecast number. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects an increase of just 45,000. On the other side, Citigroup is projecting a gain of 135,000, but one that it attributes to seasonal distortions, with \"appropriately adjusted payroll growth ... closer to zero.\"Wiping out previous gainsThen there are the revisions, a nettlesome problem for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as it struggles to get timely and relevant data. Last September, the BLS estimated in its preliminary adjustment that benchmark revisions for the year prior to March 2025 would show 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, or about half the total. The bureau will report the final number Wednesday, with expectations that the final count will be less than that but still significant. Goldman, for instance, estimated the number to be between 750,000-900,000, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a few weeks ago that it could be closer to 600,000. Every month of 2025 reported so far has seen downward revisions, taking initially reported estimates down by 624,000 and leaving average monthly payroll gains of less than 40,000. Wednesday's report will feature the first revision for December's count. The BLS also is adjusting the model it uses to estimate jobs created by businesses opening and closing during the month, which also could play with the numbers.In any event, the revisions will show a stumbling labor market that likely will get further attention from Powell and his colleagues as they plot their next policy move.Lowering expectationsEven White House officials have been spending time this week trying to tamp down expectations.Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director who was a finalist to become the next Federal Reserve chair, told CNBC that several factors are converging to keep payroll growth low, at least for the time being.Primary among them is the administration's efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Hassett also cited rising productivity stemming from artificial intelligence improvements that is restraining businesses' need to hire.\"I think that you should expect slightly smaller job numbers that are consistent with high GDP growth right now. ... One shouldn't panic if you see a sequence of numbers that are lower than you're used to,\" he said Monday. \"Because, again, population growth is going down and productivity growth is skyrocketing. It's an unusual set of circumstances.\"Hassett added that there could be a scenario where \"job creation lags, productivity skyrockets, profits skyrocket, GDP skyrockets.\" watch nowThere have been other signs of labor market deterioration lately.Job openings plunged in December to their lowest level since September 2020, according to the BLS. At the same time, planned layoffs and hires both had their worst January since the global financial crisis in 2009, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Also, ADP reported private hiring of just 22,000 in January. On the bright side, Homebase reported that small businesses added jobs at a 3.3% rate last month, better than the 3.1% level in January 2025 and well above the 1.3% for the same month in 2024.From the Fed's perspective, policymakers look at employment trends over a period and not a month at a time. Most officials are expecting slowing hiring coupled with a low level of layoffs that, rather than suggesting a material weakening, point more to stabilization. In speeches Tuesday, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland both said they think the economy is progressing well but are more worried about inflation than unemployment. They also cast doubt on the need for further interest rate cuts.\"Rather than trying to fine-tune the funds rate, I'd prefer to err on the side of patience as we assess the impact of recent rate reductions and monitor how the economy performs,\" Hammack said. \"Based on my forecast, we could be on hold for quite some time.\"",

    "body": "Elon Musk announced his new company xAI which he says has the goal to understand the true nature of the universe. Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI has lost its second co-founder in two days.Influential researcher Jimmy Ba on Tuesday announced his departure in a post on X, thanking Musk and writing that he was, \"Grateful to have helped cofound at the start.\"Ba's departure comes just one day after fellow co-founder Tony Wu announced his own exit from xAI, which merged with Musk's aerospace company SpaceX earlier this month. The xAI co-founder exodus comes as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year. A University of Toronto professor, Ba was credited for critical research that influenced the company's Grok version 4 AI models. Besides Ba and Wu, other co-founders including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed Musk's artificial intelligence venture. Greg Yang announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.The record-setting, all-stock deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire his social network X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The departures also come as xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S. The probes were initiated after the company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.WATCH: SpaceX deal to aquire xAI 'adresses critical bottlenecks around AI', says Baillie Gifford Tim Garrat",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesThroughout its history, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to significant price fluctuations, whether that's due to larger macro factors impacting all asset classes or during \"crypto winters\" tied to industry concerns.But with a crypto-friendly Trump administration and expectations for passage of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, many onlookers expected another bull run in digital assets to start 2026. However, it's been the exact opposite. Bitcoin is down more than 21% so far this year, and it fell to $60,062.00 last week — its lowest level in roughly 16 months. That marked a drop of nearly 50% from its record back in October 2025.What is driving this latest decline? Rather than a single event, Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said at the CNBC Digital Finance Forum on Tuesday in New York City that it's a reflection of a larger industry shift. When bitcoin fell 22% in less than a day back in November 2022 following the collapse of FTX, there was a \"breakdown in trust,\" Novogratz told CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos at the event. \"This time, there's no smoking gun,\" he said. \"You look around like, what happened?\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin price since the start of 2026Novogratz did note the wipeout that occurred in October 2025 as a significant event, when more than 1.6 million traders suffered a combined $19.37 billion erasure of leveraged positions over a 24-hour period, a situation that he said, \"wiped out a lot of retail and market makers\" and put plenty of pressure on prices.\"Crypto is all about narratives, it's about stories,\" he said. \"Those stories take a while to build and you're pulling people in … so when you wipe out a lot of those people, Humpty Dumpty doesn't get put back together right away,\" he said.But Novogratz also sees something more lasting he expects to come out of the current downturn, saying the recent era of crypto investing, \"the age of speculation,\" will be phased out going forward as the crypto industry has brought in \"institutions where people have a different risk tolerance.\"\"Retail people don't get into crypto because they want to make 11% annualized,\" he said. \"They get in because they want to make 30 to one, eight to one, 10 to one.\"Some traders will always speculate, Novogratz says, but overall, \"it's going to be transposed or replaced by us using these same rails, these crypto rails, to bring banking [and] financial services to the whole world. And so, it's going to be real world assets with much lower returns.\"He also pointed to tokenized stocks as assets that will have \"a different return profile.\"Sigalos asked Novogratz if the eventual passage of the CLARITY Act could be a catalyst for the industry, with the stall in the crypto market structure bill's momentum on Capitol Hill at least a short-term headwind. He is confident a crypto market structure bill will eventually become law.\"I talked to [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer two nights ago and he said 'We're going to pass the goddamn CLARITY Act,'\" Novogratz said. \"The Democrats want to pass the act, and the Republicans want to.\"Novogratz said the crypto industry needs the bill for \"a lot of reasons,\" but notably, \"We need it for spirit back in the crypto market.\"watch now",

    "body": "CSL employees.William West | AFP | Getty ImagesShares of Australian biotech firm CSL plunged to an 8-year low Wednesday after it announced the exit of Paul McKenzie as chief executive officer, and posted weak earnings for the first half of its fiscal year.Shares fell 17% to 151.3 Australian dollars, their lowest since February 2018.Senior executive Gordon Naylor, who has been with the company for 33 years, has been appointed as interim CEO, effective Wednesday, until a permanent replacement is found.

Revenue dropped 4% to $8.3 billion. The company said it was also impacted by government policy changes, but did not elaborate on that in its earnings release.\"We are clearly not satisfied with our performance and have implemented a number of initiatives to drive stronger growth going forward,\" said Ken Lim, CSL's chief financial officer.The company, one of the world's largest producers of flu vaccines, had a market cap of $58.9 billion as of Tuesday, data from LSEG showed. It highlighted that the seasonal influenza vaccine market in the U.S. was expected to fall by 6%-8% due to lower immunization rates.CSL said it expects results to improve in the second half of the year and kept its full-year outlook unchanged, forecasting modest growth in revenue and profit. The company also expanded its share buyback program by $250 million to $750 million.

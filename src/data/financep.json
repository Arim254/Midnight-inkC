    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks to reporters at the White House in Washington, D.C., Oct. 22, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

Small-cap names are witnessing a decline over the same period, meanwhile, the firm found.\"While productivity for the S&P 500 has soared 5.5% since ChatGPT, it's down 12.3% for the Russell 2000,\" Wells Fargo equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in recent note to clients. \"We see other examples of diverging trends in consumer, industrial, and financial markets.\"Wells Fargo analysis comparing real revenue per worker between Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indicesWells FargoBreakthrough advancements in AI this year have led major corporations such as Amazon to notably go all-in on the technology, finding ways to eliminate human roles that can be replaced by AI machines.The performance of the S&P 500 versus the Russell 2000 small-cap index reflect this divergence in productivity gains. The broad market index is up 74% since ChatGPT's 2022 launch, while the Russell is only up 39%.The biggest U.S. companies have been internally deploying AI tools over the past few years to improve their productivity, supply chains and, in some cases, cut headcount. A World Economic Forum survey published at the start of 2025 found that roughly 40% of companies around the world expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years in roles where AI can automate tasks.Layoffs this year have been on the rise with several big-name companies, including Target, Meta, Starbucks, Oracle, Microsoft and UPS, having announced significant, and sometimes historic, cuts to their total headcount. Companies have mostly cited efforts to streamline operations and growth strategy as reasons for cuts, but many are nodding to AI as part of the reason that human worker roles can be axed now or in the future.For one, Amazon has been a leader in robot deployment across its facilities, which the e-commerce giant has said is improving costs and delivery times. The New York Times reported in October that Amazon executives believe the company is on track to replace more than half a million jobs with robots, which they believe will save about 30 cents on each item Amazon selects, packs and delivers to customers. Morgan Stanley believes Amazon's robotics efforts can save the company between $2 billion and $4 billion by 2027.Klarna, which has been among the most transparent in how AI is affecting its headcount, has shrunk its workforce by about 40%, in part due to its AI investments. CrowdStrike in May announced cuts to 5% of the company's global workforce, citing AI efficiencies and saying that the technology \"flattens our hiring curve.\" IBM's CEO has forecasted 30% of non-customer-facing roles to be cut by 2028 and told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots have replaced 200 HR employees, freeing up investments to hire more people in sales and programming.Palo Alto Networks, Walmart and McDonald's are other companies that have notably been leveraging AI in ways that analysts expect will improve margins, we previously reported.A September Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Insights survey of 5,000 small businesses in US, Canada, the UK, and Australia revealed that 68% of businesses have integrated AI into their daily operations, with roughly two-thirds reporting an increase in productivity.\"The numbers don't lie,\" Wells Fargo's Kwon said in his report.",

    "body": "Gold prices were flat in Asia trade on Wednesday as investors held back from placing large bets ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision, while also keeping a close watch on the developments surrounding the Israel-Iran conflict. Anindito Mukherjee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe narrow lanes of Zaveri Bazaar, one of the oldest jewelers' markets in India's financial capital, Mumbai, grew even more congested this Diwali as crowds jostled to buy gold on the auspicious first day of the festival of lights.But there was a twist.Most of the people thronging the market were there to buy gold coins or bars — not jewelry — Mahavir Kothari, a wholesaler of precious metals in Zaveri Bazaar told CNBC.Leading gems and jewelry trade bodies in India told CNBC that more than 40 tons of gold was sold in the country on Oct. 19, the first day of Diwali.About 700 billion rupees ($8 billion) to 1 trillion rupees ($11 billion) worth of gold was sold during the five-day festival that ended Thursday, according to India Bullion and Jewellers Association, or IBJA, and All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, or GJC.Ajay Chawla, chief executive officer of one of India's largest jewelry chains, Tanishq, reportedly warned his firm could run out of gold coins and bars due to the festive-season demand.A few years ago, out of 10 customers, only one would opt for a coin or gold bar, said Surendra Mehta, National Secretary at IBJA, but this is slowly changing. He added that according to the estimates of his trade body, sales of jewelry had dropped by about 30% this festive season compared to last year.The enthusiasm among Indians over buying gold for investments has been rooted in their search for returns. Gold this year had risen 66% by mid-October, before seeing a sharp slide — it was still up 55% as of Monday. Earlier this month, gold prices smashed past $4,000 an ounce, with some industry experts forecasting the yellow metal to touch $5,000 in 2026.India is the second largest purchaser of gold after China, according to data from the World Gold Council, which shows the country has been a consistent buyer for years, driven by traditional demand for gold during the festive (October) and wedding seasons (October to mid-January and April to May).Gold jewellery in a shop in Kolkata, India.Sonali Pal Chaudhury | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAs global central banks increase their gold purchases, fueling a surge in prices, the yellow metal is increasingly attracting retail investors who fear missing out on the boom.Goldman Sachs in a report on Sept. 30 said that central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have increased their pace of gold purchases by roughly fivefold since 2022, when Russia's foreign-currency reserves were frozen following its invasion of Ukraine.\"We view this as a structural shift in reserve management behavior, and we do not expect a near-term reversal,\" the report said.These sharp gains in gold prices are making Indians see gold not just as a consumption product, but a key investment asset, experts said.Earlier, when gold demand was largely driven by consumption and prices of jewelry rose, consumers would cut back on spending, said Anindya Banerjee, head of commodity and currency markets at Kotak Securities. But elevated prices have not curbed the overall demand for gold this festive season.Rajesh Rokde, chairman of GJC said that volume-wise sales for all five days of Diwali were just about 5% lower compared to last year, despite significantly higher prices.Gold currently trades at $4,073 per ounce.\"India's households wealth held in gold is estimated at $3.8tn/ 88.8% of GDP,\" said Morgan Stanley in a report on Oct. 9. \"This is providing a positive wealth effect, even as benign macro stability ensures that flow of gold demand remains range bound,\" it added.Gold is a good hedge against falling rupee and any weakness in Indian equity markets, said Mukesh Jindal, senior partner at wealth management firm Alpha Capital that handles assets of more than 100 billion rupees for family offices and high net worth individuals in India.Investments include purchasing gold bars, coins, exchange traded funds and even digital gold. In September, inflows into gold ETFs rose more than six-fold to (83.63 billion rupees) from a year earlier, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India.The rally in gold is likely to continue as central banks across the world remain net buyers of the metal month on month, Jindal said, adding that he has been advising clients to allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to gold. That is still conservative compared to Bridgewater Associates' founder and billionaire Ray Dalio's advise earlier this month of allocating as much as 15% of one's portfolio to gold.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

Job reductions have continued this year, though at a smaller scale. Amazon's cloud, stores, communications and devices divisions have been hit with layoffs in recent months.The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting campaign by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. Jassy has also moved to simplify Amazon's corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations.\"Jassy said in June that Amazon's workforce could shrink further as a result of the company embracing generative AI, telling staffers that the company \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"\"It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,\" Jassy said in the June memo to staff.WATCH: Report: Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts beginning Tuesdaywatch now",

    "body": "To find out how well a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund has performed over a certain period, you typically look at total return.That number bakes in a few assumptions. Namely, that you put a chunk of money into the fund and let it sit there the entire time, periodically reinvesting any dividends that may have come in.Of course, that's not how real people invest. After you buy a fund, you might end up adding a few more shares if the fund gets hot. Or maybe you sell a chunk if you find another investment you like better.For this reason, even if you've held a fund for a decade, the 10-year return you see on your portfolio page is unlikely to match the official return on the fund's website. And, on average, investors' returns are lower than those of the funds they own.Over the 10 years ended December 2024, the average dollar invested in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs returned an annualized 7%, according to Morningstar's 2025 \"Mind the Gap\" study. Over the same period, those funds returned 8.2%, on average.Put another way, over the course of the decade researchers analyzed, investors lost out on about 15% of their returns.That 1.2 percentage-point difference is what Morningstar researchers call the \"investor return gap.\" In general, it can be attributed to investor behavior, says Jeffrey Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services.\"Literally, it would be buying high and selling low,\" Ptak says.How to narrow your performance gapThe most obvious examples of self-destructive behavior from investors come during market extremes, Ptak says, with over-exuberant investors piling into the market when stocks have already shot up and panic-selling when the market hits the skids.But the kind of behavior that leads to long-term underperformance \"could be much more mundane than that,\" he says. It just may be a coincidence of timing that you buy a fund before a few of its holdings decline in value. Or maybe you sell to raise money for something else, and the fund takes off.Morningstar's data isn't a perfect roadmap for maximizing returns from the funds you own, but it does potentially highlight a few possible strategies for keeping more of the money your funds earn. But remember: Experts recommend talking with a financial professional before making any major changes to your investing strategy.Avoid taking on too much riskAs a rule, investments that come with a higher level of risk also offer higher returns. Among professional investors, this is known as the risk \"premium.\"  But if you have a highly volatile fund in your portfolio, the data shows that you're less likely to realize that fund's full potential.\"More volatile funds are harder for investors to succeed with than less volatile funds,\" Ptak says. \"And that was true even when we were controlling for fund type.\"Across all types of mutual funds and ETFs, investors in the least volatile quintile of funds experienced a return gap of 0.4%, compared with a 2% gap among the most volatile funds.It's impossible to draw a precise conclusion as to why that is, but it's not hard to believe that financial psychology plays a role, Ptak says. Theoretically, the jumpier a fund's performance, the more tempted an investor might be to panic and sell when things get bad.\"Somebody could be following the theory and think, I'll invest in [riskier assets] that pay you a premium return,\" Ptak says. \"That's all well and good, but if you can't hang on, you aren't going to be getting any sort of risk premium. On the contrary, you'll probably have a gap.\"Invest deliberatelyMorningstar's data tends to support the idea that investors who take a hands-off, buy-and-hold approach generally have a smaller gap than people who trade more frequently.Case in point: Among the different types of funds researchers analyzed, allocation funds — which largely consist of target-date funds — produced the lowest investor gap on average, just 0.1 percentage point.The reason for the small gap likely comes down to how these funds, which are designed to grow more conservative as you age, are commonly held: in long-term retirement accounts.The best way to keep your investing gap narrow, Ptak says, is to invest in a diversified portfolio and automate your trading as much as you can to avoid discretionary or emotional trading.\"Less is more,\" he says. \"The less transacting you have to do, the better off you're going to be.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Members of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union protest against firings during a rally to defend federal workers in Washington, DC on Feb. 11, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe largest union representing federal workers on Monday called for Democrats in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown by voting for the stopgap funding measure that Republicans have proposed.\"It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote.\"No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today,\" said Kelley, whose union represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren't looking for partisan spin,\" Kelley said. \"They're looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they're being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.\"The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and has led to about 900,000 federal workers being furloughed.Senate Democrats have largely resisted voting for the clean resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, saying they want any funding measure to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Republicans, in turn, say the fate of ACA tax credits should be addressed only after a funding resolution is passed.At least 60 senators need to vote for such a measure because of the Senate's filibuster rules. Republicans only hold 53 seats in that chamber.In his statement, Kelley did not explicitly address the question of the ACA subsidies, but he seemed to refer to it, writing, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.\"\"Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,\" Kelley wrote. \"Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington.\"\"But there is no 'winning' a government shutdown. They cost taxpayers billions, hurt small businesses, and erode confidence in government itself,\" he said.",

The tech factors in the length of a stay, the distance from a guest's location, property type and timing of a booking to block reservations deemed \"higher risk.\"\"We lead the way in proactive measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized parties, and our heightened technology for Halloween is one important layer in a comprehensive suite of policies and tools to support hosts, guests and local communities, and promote responsible travel,\" the company wrote in a release.This isn't the first time Airbnb has attempted to block parties during holidays.Last year, the company said it prevented about 38,000 people in the U.S. and 6,300 in Canada from making bookings during Halloween weekend. The company has also used the tech during New Year's Eve and summer holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.Airbnb said the rate of parties reported worldwide has dropped by 50% since it implemented a ban on parties and events in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid. The party ban became official in 2022.The company cracked down on parties and implemented a number of new safety measures in 2019 in response to a deadly shooting at an Airbnb booking that left five dead.Following the shooting, CEO Brian Chesky announced a ban on \"party houses\" in a post to the social media platform now known as X. At the time, Chesky said that the company was also cracking down on \"abusive host and guest conduct.\"Airbnb said accounts that break the no party policy will be suspended or banned from the platform. The company also said its offers features like a 24-hour safety line and noise sensor for hosts.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new product updates, integrating AI and state of AI tech racewatch now",

As part of the deal, founder and then CEO Alexandr Wang stepped down to join the social media company.Concerns over Scale AI's neutrality following the Meta investment reportedly caused some large AI labs, including Google and OpenAI, to cut ties following the deal.\"It just doesn't happen too often in startups where your biggest competitor gets torpedoed overnight,\" cofounder Adarsh Hiremath told Forbes.The startup still faces competition in the data-labeling space, including Scale AI rival Surge AI, which is reportedly aiming for up to $1 billion in a new raise, according to Reuters.

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ... Never have been, never will be.\"Mellon's contribution aims to help cover the cost of U.S. military personnel's salaries and benefits as the federal shutdown drags on.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe donation might have violated the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from spending funds that have not been appropriated by Congress, the Times reported.Mellon's gift is also unlikely to go far in offsetting the cost of military pay.There are more than 1.3 million troops in the active-duty military, and the Trump administration's 2025 budget included a request of around $600 billion in military compensation, the Times reported.Mellon, whose grandfather, Andrew Mellon, was one of the longest-serving Treasury secretaries, is a longtime Trump donor.He contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, one of the biggest single donations ever publicly shared, The Times reported.A spokesman for Sen. Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

    "body": "watch nowQualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.The stock soared 11% following the news.The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.Qualcomm's data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm's smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs.\"We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level,\" Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week.The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms.Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawThe industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia's chips were used to train OpenAI's GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT.But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data.The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks.Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm's data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU.\"What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, 'I'm going to mix and match,'\" Malladi said.The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm's customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power.Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.Qualcomm's design for an AI server called AI200.QualcommStock Chart IconStock chart iconQualcomm one day stock chart.",

    "body": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney waves next to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 7, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he was slapping an extra 10% tariff on imports from Canada in retaliation for what he says is a misleading TV ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.\"Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement in Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.Canada generally pays a 35% tariff on goods sold in the U.S., with exceptions for certain products covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and other specific product exceptions, such as steel and aluminum, which are tariffed at 50%.Trump late Friday blasted the Ontario provincial government in Canada for waiting until after the first two games of the World Series to pause the Reagan ad.\"They could have pulled it tonight,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he headed to fly to Asia.\"Well, that's dirty play,\" he said. \"But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.\"Trump had cited the ad in his decision on Thursday night to trade negotiations with Canada.Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Friday afternoon said he would pause the ad on Monday so that trade talks could resume.But Ford also said, \"I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"Trump said Friday night that he had heard that Ontario was pulling the ad.But he also said he did not know the government was leaving it on until Monday.The ad was shown Friday night during a broadcast to millions of Americans of the first game of the World Series.That game was won 11-4 by Canada's Toronto Blue Jays over the U.S.'s Los Angeles Dodgers.Toronto is in Ontario, and is the hometown of Ford.Ford, in a tweet earlier Friday announcing the ad pause, said, \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said, apparently referring to Trump.\"In speaking with Prime Minister [Mark] Carney, Ontario will pause its U.S. advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

But the ad accurately captures Reagan saying, \"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"The ad also has Reagan, from the same speech, saying, \"When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.\"\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said in the speech and in the ad.Ford, who calls himself a \"big Ronald Reagan fan,\" first posted the ad on X on Oct. 16, days after saying that Ontario's government would spend $75 million to run the ad in the United States.\"We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country,\" said Ford.Trump raged about the ad in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!! They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,\" Trump wrote.\"Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs, charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they, and other countries, can't take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.\"The Supreme Court in early November is set to hear oral arguments in a case that will determine if Trump had power under the law to impose sweeping tariffs against scores of countries, including Canada, without the consent of Congress.",

Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, traded 14.7% and 9.5% lower, respectively.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News' \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that Washington and Beijing were expected to reach a deal to avoid a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with Beijing set to defer on imposing strict rare earth export controls.His comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday.Trump on Monday said that the U.S. and China were set to \"come away with\" a trade deal. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan amid a weeklong Asia trip, Trump said that he had \"a lot of respect for President Xi.\"watch nowThe U.S. president had previously threatened to impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting from Nov. 1, adding at the time that the White House would also slap export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"China, for its part, announced a new framework earlier this month for restricting rare earth exports. The move was seen as a stark warning to the West — and a reflection of the deepening mistrust between Beijing and Washington.To be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.\"Details are still limited, and nothing will be finalized until the Trump-Xi meeting,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 26 note.\"But a renewed truce now seems near-certain, with China likely fully delaying their rare earth export controls for a year—better than the alternative of an agreement to grant licenses,\" Marcus said.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

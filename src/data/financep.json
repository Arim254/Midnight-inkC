Together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics — driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward,\" Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, said in a statement.</p><p>Artificial Super Intelligence, or ASI, is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/softbank-ceo-predicts-ai-that-is-10000-times-smarter-than-humans-.html\">Son's idea of AI</a> that is 10,000 times smarter than humans.</p><p>Son has looked to position <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/softbank-founder-son-makes-his-biggest-bet-by-staking-the-future-on-ai.html\">SoftBank at the center of the potential AI boom</a> through investments and acquisitions in different areas of technology. SoftBank owns chip designer Arm, for example, and has a major stake in OpenAI.</p><p>SoftBank already has some robot-related investments, including AutoStore Holdings and Agile Robots.</p><p>The Japanese conglomerate is not new to robotics. In 2012, SoftBank took a majority stake in a French company called Aldebaran. Two years later, the two companies launched a humanoid robot called Pepper — a bet that ultimately flopped, but robotics has now re-emerged as a key focus for the Japanese giant.</p><p>Morten Wierod, who became CEO of ABB in August 2024, has pushed the spin-off of the company's robotics unit as a strategic move.</p><p>ABB said in a statement that the sale \"will create immediate value to ABB shareholders.\" The company said it will use the proceeds from the transaction \"in line with its well-established capital allocation principles.\"</p><p>ABB said it expected cash proceeds of approximately $5.3 billion. The expected separation cost is around $200 million, about half of which is already in ABB's 2025 guidance.</p></div></div>",

The clip ended with the numbers \"10/7,\" indicating Tuesday's date for the reveal.</p><p>Tesla posted a second <a href=\"https://x.com/Tesla/status/1975005586283434056\" target=\"_blank\">clip</a> to X on Sunday showing the outline of a vehicle's headlights in the dark.</p><p>Shares climbed 5% Monday as the buzz grew online over what the announcement would be, but dipped about 3% on Tuesday. Many investors were hoping for updates on other new products such as the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years.</p><p>The standard variant of the Model Y doesn't feature a panoramic glass roof, leather seats or the light bars like the higher-end versions of the SUV. It costs about $5,000 less than the previous, entry-level version of the Model Y.</p><p>The new Model Y standard features a battery that gets 321 miles of estimated range on a full charge, compared to the 357 miles of range in a Long Range version with rear wheel drive.</p><p>The lower prices may help Tesla attract some buyers after the loss of $7,500 federal EV tax credits, which went away with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump's</a> spending bill.

The Cybertuck never achieved the level of popularity of Tesla's Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUVs and has been the subject of at least eight voluntary recalls in the U.S.</p><p>With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car busine<em>s</em>s.</p><p>The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. But it's also due to an aging lineup and increased competition from companies including Volkswagen and BYD.</p><p>In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, \"We, Robot\" event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000.</p><p>As of the company's second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production.</p><p>At an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/tesla-semi-and-roadster-impressed-but-questions-linger.html\">event in late 2017</a>, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to \"fly,\" and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor.</p><p>Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade.</p><p>The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Alphabet's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Waymo and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BIDU/\">Baidu's</a><span><span></span></span></span> Apollo Go.</p><p>In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla's Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they've yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots.</p><p>Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. It's now up 12% for the year. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/06/tesla-teases-new-product-launch-in-social-media-post.html\">Tesla teases new product launch</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208275-17597686351759768633-41974447527-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759768634&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Tesla teases new product launch in social media post\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.\"</p><p>Trump has also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/trump-mass-firings-government-shutdown.html\">threatened mass firings</a>, if Democrats won't agree to the GOP funding proposal.</p></div><h2><a></a>Back pay guaranteed by law</h2><div><p>The memo runs counter to a federal law that requires back pay for federal workers after a shutdown ends, and to recent guidance from the Trump administration.</p><p>Congress passed<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/24\" target=\"_blank\"> the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019</a>, and Trump signed it, after the last government shutdown, which lasted for a record 35 days.</p><p>\"Each employee of the United States Government or of a District of Columbia public employer furloughed as a result of a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/24/text\" target=\"_blank\">law</a>.</p><p>In prior shutdowns, Congress would pass a bill to provide federal workers with back pay.</p></div><div><p>The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, called the administration's argument \"frivolous\" and \"an obvious misinterpretation of the law.\"</p><p>\"It is also inconsistent with the Trump administration's own guidance from mere days ago, which clearly and correctly states that furloughed employees will receive retroactive pay for the time they were out of work as quickly as possible once the shutdown is over,\" Everett Kelley, the national president of AFGE, said in a statement.</p><p>The Office of Personnel Management, the government's equivalent of a human resources department, <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/guidance-for-shutdown-furloughs-sep-28-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">issued guidance</a> dated September 2025 stating that retroactive pay will be available for federal employees affected by a lapse in appropriations \"as soon as possible after the lapse in appropriations ends.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Federal workers may have other legal options</h2><div><p>\"The federal government's threat not to pay furloughed federal employees is both alarming and legally questionable,\" said Tom Spiggle, a labor and employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm in Washington, D.C.</p><p>If the administration does not provide back pay, workers may have other legal options, he said, including bringing a case under the Fair Labor Standards Act. They could also appeal through the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency charged with protecting federal employees.<strong> </strong>A class action lawsuit may also be an option.</p><p>\"Federal employees should document their losses and preserve records of any communications or threats related to pay,\" Spiggle said. Those legal avenues for recourse can take months, if not years, to resolve.</p><p>If you're missing paychecks, here are some strategies to cope with delayed or lost income. </p></div><h2><a></a>Focus on cash flow</h2><div><p>Start with a vigorous accounting of expenses: \"Three things you really need to focus on ... cash flow, cash flow and cash flow,\" said Mary Clements Evans, a certified financial planner and owner of Evans Wealth Strategies in Emmaus, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Many people don't have an understanding of their monthly expenses beyond the large essentials such as rent or mortgage and car payments, she said. Automatic payments and debit or credit card swipes can also make it harder to gauge discretionary spending. </p><p>\"We're in a world where we're disconnected from our spending habits,\" Evans said.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205935-17592577511759257749-41889411837-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759257751&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Here's how to manage your finances during a government shutdown\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Once you have a handle on expenses, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/here-are-ways-to-get-by-without-a-paycheck-after-a-layoff.html\">plan for reduced income</a>. This may mean determining <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/20/no-1-money-mistake-to-avoid-after-being-laid-off.html\">which savings to tap</a> and adjusting your budget.</p><p>\"It sounds like that's a financial equation, but it's not. It's often emotional and psychological, because they feel they're losing their identity and their status,\" said Evans, who is also the author of \"Emotionally Invested.\"</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/trump-doge-mass-job-cuts-federal-workers-money-questions-answered.html\">Reach out to your lenders</a>. Financial institutions may offer payment deferrals, loan modifications and other forms of hardship assistance. For example, Navy Federal Credit Union is offering a Paycheck Assistance Program with <a href=\"https://www.navyfederal.org/about/government-shutdown.html\" target=\"_blank\">zero-interest loans</a> for eligible members affected by the shutdown.</p></div><h2><a></a>Prepare for possible unemployment</h2><div><p>Andreypopov | Istock | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>The Trump administration's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-government-shutdown-layoffs-omb.html\">plan for a \"reduction in force,\"</a> or RIF, is unique to this shutdown.</p><p>\"It's obviously a changing time in terms of the willingness of this administration to take novel views of what has previously been considered, and is from a plain reading, considered clear law,\" said John Hatton, staff vice president for policy and programs at the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association.</p><p>During a shutdown, a majority of employees at government agencies funded through the annual appropriations process are typically put on furlough, or unpaid leave, if the agency hasn't received funding. Those whose work is necessary to protect life or property, or to deliver mandated benefits, are considered essential and required to work, according to <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/guidance-for-shutdown-furloughs-sep-28-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">the Office of Personnel Management</a>. </p><p>\"This is always a difficult situation for federal employees,\" Hatton said, \"whether they're working or furloughed or now, adding this new option of receiving a RIF notice, for possible permanent loss of their employment.\"</p><p>Two federal employee unions, AFGE and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have <a href=\"https://www.afge.org/globalassets/documents/generalreports/2025/shutdown-complaint-093025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">filed a lawsuit</a> to keep the Trump administration from moving forward with RIFs during the shutdown, calling the threat of RIFs unlawful.</p><p>There are legal requirements for an RIF: Agencies must provide justification for the layoffs, give written notice to employees 60 days before a layoff and offer an appeals process. During a shutdown, only \"essential\" functions are supposed to be carried out, and experts say it's uncertain if carrying out mass layoffs would fit that definition.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108191784-17563785621756378560-41385286152-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1756378562&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Consumers' debt dilemma: Here's what to know\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>To prepare for a possible layoff, federal employees should research <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/doge-layoffs-may-overwhelm-unemployment-system-for-federal-workers.html\">unemployment benefits</a> and determine when their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/trump-doge-mass-job-cuts-federal-workers-money-questions-answered.html\">health coverage</a> might end.</p><p>Research health insurance costs, too.

Carlyle also reported that consumer prices for energy declined 3.8% while services excluding shelter, a key Federal Reserve data point, rose 3.3%.</p><p>Carlyle said it derived its data from its \"expansive global portfolio\" that includes 277 companies, 694 real estate investments and 730,000 employees.</p><p>Though the firm saw weaker employment data, Goldman Sachs recently said its \"underlying job growth\" tracker indicated a gain of 80,000 positions in September. Goldman also reported that the labor market is loosening, meaning there are more workers than jobs, to levels not seen in 10 years.</p><p>A New York Fed survey released Monday indicated ongoing concern with the state of the labor market.</p><p>The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for September showed that the share of those expecting the unemployment rate to be higher a year from now rose to 41.1%, up 2 percentage points from the prior month. Also, the mean probability of losing one's job in the next year increased to 14.9%, up 0.4 percentage point.</p><p>However, the perceived probability of being able to find a job in three months after losing one's current position rose to 47.4%, up from a series low 44.9% in August.</p></div></div>",

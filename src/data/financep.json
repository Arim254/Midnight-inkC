    "body": "If I tell you that I'm a successful entrepreneur who runs a thriving business, you might picture an always-on founder who works late into the night and regularly puts in overtime. But I've built up sustainable passive income streams and work just four hours a day.As a content creator, I make videos about productivity and brand-building. I've also written three books, sell products, and offer courses and coaching. But I don't want to spend 100 hours a week working at the expense of time to travel, write, or be with my husband and two young daughters.About five years into my career, I started auditing my time to identify and reduce waste.Here are six time-wasting habits I quit so I could level up my life:1. I quit taking every meetingI live in this amazing world where lots of awesome people want to talk to me, call me, meet with me, hire me. But if I took every single meeting, I'd get nothing else done.When I get a meeting invitation, I don't just click yes right away. I look to see: Do we have an agenda? Is that agenda important to me? Have we discussed this already?If I decide a meeting doesn't align with my priorities or could be handled better with an email exchange, I let the organizer know that it wasn't a fit for my current priorities or there needed to be a more specific agenda for the time commitment. I love looking at a clean, intentional calendar every day. 2. I quit working without time blocksIf I have to do something, it's blocked off on my calendar. On a given day, I might have a two-hour block to schedule my next three months of video content creation and a two-hour block to write an article like this one.This forces me to prioritize what I'll focus on and agree to give it my full energy. I usually have no more than two, maybe three, time blocks per day so I can give everything the attention it deserves. It makes me — and my work — better.3. I quit saying yes to everythingI used to say yes to every podcast interview, coffee chat, and collaboration request. I thought that's what you had to do to build a business. But I was exhausted and my work was suffering.Now, when someone asks me to participate in something, I check if it aligns with my current goals. Last month alone, I said no to three podcast interviews that would have taken hours of prep time. I used those hours to create content for my YouTube channel and work on my next book.As a result, the people who matter most respect my time more, and I respect myself more, too.4. I quit social media scrollingAbout two years ago, I realized I was spending 90 minutes a day mindlessly scrolling Instagram and TikTok. That's 10.5 hours a week I could be writing or spending with my daughters.The first thing I did was turn off all my notifications. Then I moved social media apps off my phone's home screen so I'd have to intentionally search for them. Now my phone stays out of my bedroom at night, and the first thing I look at in the morning is a note with my goals — not Instagram.I still use social media for my business, but I'm intentional about it. I check it twice a day for 15 minutes each time, and I curate my feed to only show content that energizes me.5. I quit starting my day reactivelyI used to wake up, grab my phone, and immediately start responding to emails and texts. By 8 a.m., I was already stressed and behind.Now I start every day with what I call my three buckets: Movement: I do 20 minutes of stretching or hit the gym.Mindfulness: I journal or read for 15 minutes. Mastery: I spend 30 minutes on whatever I'm trying to master — right now, it's learning Spanish.This routine takes just over an hour, but it means I start my workday at 9 a.m. feeling energized and focused instead of frazzled. I don't check email until after I've completed all three buckets.6. I quit consuming without creatingThree years ago, I'd spend entire evenings watching YouTube videos about content creation and business strategy, but I wasn't actually creating anything myself. I felt stuck and behind.Now I have a strict rule: I don't consume any content unless I've already created something that day. Before I watch anything, I need to have written, filmed, or planned my own content first.This shift completely changed my mindset. When I do consume content now, I see it as inspiration rather than a sign I'm falling behind. Last year alone, this habit helped me publish dozens of YouTube videos and write my third book.Amy Landino is the bestselling author of Good Morning Good Life, personal brand coach and the award-winning creator of AmyTV on YouTube.

    "body": "When in a heated basketball game or rushing against the clock to meet a deadline at work, sometimes delivering constructive criticism needs to be quick.Taking the time to present feedback in an appeasing way like using the \"sandwich approach\" to share criticism in between two compliments is simply not feasible when you're in a crunch, says Sonia Raman, head coach of the WNBA's Seattle Storm.In a basketball game, \"you might have a couple seconds when the ball goes out of bounds to talk to a player before we inbound and go to the next play,\" Raman says. \"There's not going to be a lot of time. You have to be really direct, and you have to go for it.\"However, delivering candid criticism in a heated moment can be risky. To avoid hurt feelings, Raman says she relies on the relationships and trust she builds with players throughout the year.Sonia Raman, former assistant coach with the Memphis Grizzlies, reviews film with player Gregory Jackson on Feb. 4, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts.Paul Rutherford | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesWhether through one-on-one meetings, side conversations during practice, or taking players out to lunch or dinner, Raman says she builds trust in various ways. Each relationship is unique, but the most important part is having genuine interactions.\"As I make those connections and [my players] start to understand that I care, and that I care not just about the wins and the losses, but about them as people, then the rest of the conversations flow,\" Raman says.How to build genuine trust in the workplaceShifting how you approach small talk can be a simple yet powerful way to build trust and genuine rapport in the workplace, leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio said in May.Instead of defaulting to conversations about the weather, take the opportunity to ask questions that show a sincere interest in the other person like \"I know things are a little hectic this week. How are you holding up?\" Or, \"I heard your son graduated this week. Congratulations! How did you celebrate?\" Mercurio said.When talking about work, building trust comes down to being honest, authentic and candid, even if you've made mistakes, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year. No one is going to trust you if you're an agreeable employee or only focus on the positives as a boss, he said.\"If you want to earn trust: If you say you've got something, deliver it. If you own something and it's not going well, be self-critical, and fix it,\" Jassy said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Billionaire serial entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban has some job-hunting advice for his two children — and anyone else who finds themselves looking for entry-level roles — in the age of artificial intelligence.The advice is simple: Prioritize working for a smaller company over fighting for a job at a large corporation.At a big business, your AI skills are probably somewhat extraneous, says Cuban: You might know how to use AI effectively, but so does everyone in the company's large, established IT department.\"Small- to medium-size companies don't have that depth,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It. \"They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don't have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results.\"Cuban referenced his own company Cost Plus Drugs as an example, in a podcast episode of \"The Dumbest Guy In the Room\" that published on Sept. 30. \"People that understand AI and agentics, [who] can go and look at our processes and automate them using AI ... [can] help us become more productive, competitive and profitable,\" he said.Podcast host John Dick's company CivicScience was similarly situated, Cuban noted.\"[Small companies] have to compete differently, and they don't have the resources to just have a huge IT department,\" said Cuban. \"Just like we saw with the early days of the internet, you hired young kids who were more comfortable with it, who learned it already and could come in and implement new things.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterNinety-five percent of companies haven't yet seen measurable revenue return from their AI investments, according to a July report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. The few companies in the minority are largely early-stage tech startups run by young entrepreneurs, who build their companies' processes around AI models specifically tailored to their businesses, the MIT report said.\"I tell [my children], like I tell every young kid, there's going to be two types of companies in this in this country: There's going to be those who are great at AI and those who used to be in business ... And if you're looking for a job, it's going to be easier to work for a small company than a large company,\" Cuban said on the podcast.Cuban, 67, has three children, including two daughters currently attending college at Vanderbilt University and UCLA. He's advised them to \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,\" he told the \"TBPN\" podcast in an Aug. 20 episode. \"Companies don't understand how to implement all that right now to get a competitive advantage,\" he added.Some other experts also say young people seeking entry-level jobs in the age of AI should emphasize their soft skills — like communication, emotional intelligence and critical thinking — to potential employers. Being curious, adaptable and embracing new opportunities to learn \"is a skill in and of itself,\" Kiersten Barnet, executive director of the nonprofit New York Jobs CEO Council, said at the CNBC Workforce Executive Council Summit on Oct. 7.Ben Goodwin, the CEO and co-founder of beverage company Olipop, attributes most of his success with his $1.85 billion-dollar company to his human skills, not his technical capabilities, he told CNBC Make It in September.\"Things that have been really important for me have been believing in myself, emotional regulation, things like storytelling, [and] getting as good as possible at leading people as quickly as possible,\" he said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom.In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that \"hyperscalers\" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic.\"Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings - one of the more common frauds of the modern era,\" Burry wrote. \"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

    "body": "Jacob Cooper's Saturdays don't look like a typical 29-year-old's.On a recent one, Cooper was up by 4:15 a.m., out of his Brooklyn apartment by 4:30, and ready to cook at a nearby commercial kitchen by 5. He and his staff prepared hundreds of hand-rolled, bite-sized bagels they'd sell that day across two events in New York City.Cooper spent his morning selling freshly baked pizza bagels to pop-up shoppers in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, worked at the Queens Night Market until midnight, and finally ended his day at home at 2 a.m.Despite the 22-hour day, Cooper says he doesn't regret leaving his former six-figure tech job to start his food business, Pizzabagel.nyc.Cooper launched the business in January 2025 and as of October has brought in close to $92,000 for the year.Jacob Cooper launched a pizza bagel business in 2025 after leaving his previous career in tech.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItHe logs up to 90 hours per week on the job but says it's a 180 from the burnout he felt before.\"Even though I'm working as hard as I ever have, every customer that comes up to the stand and tells me how great they are, every time they come back wanting more, it helps keep me going,\" Cooper says. \"I have a lot of fun doing this.\"From burnout to bagelsCooper didn't plan to become a pizza bagels pro. His first career was in tech.He studied computer science at Cornell and in 2017 co-founded an AI company with classmates, becoming the startup's chief technology officer. Over the next seven years, the team raised money, hired staff and weathered the Covid-19 pandemic.Jacob Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItBut by 2023, Cooper was burning out. He and the CEO fought a lot, \"and we both kind of said, 'this is not really working,'\" he says. In 2024, Cooper left the company and his $120,000 annual salary without a plan.After a few months of feeling lost, inspiration struck: Cooper loved Bagel Bites when he was a kid, but as an adult revisited them and felt they could use an upgrade.Cooper experimented with pizza bagel recipes with the help of Reddit forums, cookbooks and \"a million\" online videos. He started cooking in his apartment and even bought extra refrigerators so he and his roommate had enough space. Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Pizzabagel.nyc currently offers six options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItCooper had sold a portion of his equity back to the AI company for $250,000, pocketing about half of that after taxes to pay his rent, insurance and other basic expenses. He also funneled that money into Pizzabagel.nyc. \"That is what allowed me to take a few months off, start this business, buy the equipment, buy the minivan, test things out, [and] lose money on it,\" Cooper says.How the business makes moneyRight now, Pizzabagel.nyc makes money in three ways: pop-ups, catering and farmers markets.It offers six pizza bagel options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion. Bagel costs vary, but at the Queens Night Market are sold two for $5.In February, its first month in business, the company made around $3,000 in sales. Cooper bought a car in May and scaled his events way up. The business started to break even over the summer and jumped to roughly $10,000 in sales for July. By September, the business hit a milestone of bringing in $20,000.It was enough to cover the business's expenses for the month. Cooper's operating costs fluctuate, but for September totaled $15,000 including payroll for one full-time employee and a small crew of part-timers, his kitchen rental, food costs, event fees and other costs.Cooper reinvested the $5,000 profit back into the company.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItCooper currently doesn't take a salary and plans to pour any profits back into the company. He estimates he has three years' worth of basic living expenses saved to keep this up. He's also invested $50,000 of his own money into the business.\"At the end of the day, I know that if this business doesn't work out, I can go get another tech job or I can do something else,\" Cooper says. \"I'm probably not going to end up on my parents' couch. Probably.\"Learning from old regretsPrior to opening his food business, Cooper says he'd never set foot in a commercial kitchen, cooked professionally or worked a restaurant service job. He worried about his lack of experience in the field.Cooper took the mistakes he learned as a tech leader to set himself up better in the food world.\"My biggest regret is that I was just young and inexperienced and didn't know what I was doing,\" Cooper says about his CTO days. \"I was too stubborn to look for help a lot of the time. Now I know to look for help. I know that I'm a newcomer to the food industry.\"Another big challenge is out of his control: the weather.For example, on a recent rainy Saturday, the business sold $1,000 worth of food at the Queens Night Market compared to the $2,000 it moves on a good day.\"You're basically just praying it's nice weather so people come out and buy stuff,\" Cooper says.Eyes on the freezer aisleCooper says he originally gave himself six months to see if Pizzabagel.nyc had momentum; by the summer, he decided to keep at it and additionally launched Littlebagel.nyc, a sister pop-up operation that specializes in mini-bagels with fun offerings like chili crisp spreads; tomato and ricotta sandwiches; and the classic bacon, egg and cheese.Jacob Cooper launched Littlebagel.nyc in September, a sister pop-up that sells mini bagels with fun spreads and sandwich options.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItEvents will slow in the winter, but Cooper knows his next move: In year two of the business, he wants to get his pizza bagels into the freezer aisle of grocery stores, specifically by his 30th birthday in January. He believes cracking the consumer packaged goods space will mean long-term success for the business.Making and selling pizza bagels might not be his forever career, Cooper says, but he's excited to see where it goes.\"I'm not going to force this business to work for me,\" he says. \"I look at it really practically, and if I'm having fun and I think there's a lot of growth, and people are really enjoying the product, I'm going to keep doing it.\"Jacob Cooper's goal with Pizzabagel.nyc is to get them into the freezer aisle at grocery stores.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make It",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Senate on Monday night passed a bill to fund the federal government through January and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.The bill, which passed 60-40 with support from a handful of Democratic senators and nearly all Republicans, will be sent to the House of Representatives.If it passes the House, the legislation will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.Trump earlier Monday said he supports the funding deal, which was negotiated between Republicans and a gang of moderate Senate Democrats nearly six weeks after the shutdown began on Oct. 1.House Speaker Mike Johnson told his Republican conference earlier Monday that he wanted GOP House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., for a vote on the bill.US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said Monday on CNN.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesUntil Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesRocket Lab's stock rose as much as 3% on Tuesday after the space company posted record revenues in the third-quarter as it scoops up more launch deals and builds its backlog.The company, which makes satellites and rockets and provides launch services to its customers, on Monday reported revenue of $155 million for the period. That surpassed the $152 million forecast from analysts polled by LSEG, and it was up 48% from about $105 million a year ago. Rocket Lab also posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 3 cents per share, versus the 10-cent per share loss anticipated.Additionally, Rocket Lab issued strong guidance for the current quarter, saying it expects revenues between $170 million and $180 million. Analysts had forecast $172 million in revenues.Rocket Lab said it's experiencing a record backlog, with 49 rocket launches on contract. The company said it signed 17 of those deals during the third quarter and plans to close out the year with over 20 launches.In an earnings release, CEO Peter Beck said the Long Beach, California, company is \"just days away\" from reaching a new annual launch record. Rocket Lab is also tackling mergers and acquisitions that target key defense initiatives such as President Donald Trump's missile defense system plan known as the 'Golden Dome,\" Beck added.Competition is intensifying in the space technology sector as the U.S. government and NASA lean on more independent contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, to power missions to return to the moon. Growing excitement has also brought a wave of space companies to the public markets this year, including Texas-based Firefly Aerospace.Last month, Rocket Lab's stock jumped more than 31% after announcing a slew of new launch deals. Shares have more than doubled this year and surged nearly 270% over the last twelve months. The stock has pulled back about 13% in November amid a broader market selloff.During the third quarter, the company closed its acquisition of satellite sensor maker Geost and opened a new launch site for its Neutron rocket.Rocket Lab reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $26.3 million, topping the $21 million to $23 million loss range previously forecast. Analysts anticipated a $22.2 million adjusted EBITDA loss, according to FactSet.The company expects adjusted EBITDA losses to range between $23 million and $29 million in the fourth quarter, surpassing the $13 million loss forecast by FactSet.WATCH: Rocket Lab CEO talks competing for Space Force contractswatch now",

Jean Carroll $5 million in damages after holding him liable for sexually abusing her during an encounter in a New York department store in the 1990s and for defaming her decades later.Trump's request on Monday comes nearly 11 months after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the verdict issued by a civil jury in Manhattan federal court in May 2023.The petition to the Supreme Court says that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the trial, made a \"series of indefensible evidentiary rulings,\" among them \"improperly admitting highly inflammatory propensity evidence against President Trump.\"That evidence included testimony by two other women who alleged that Trump committed sexual misconduct against them at other times.The petition also says that Kaplan erred by allowing Carroll's lawyer to play for jurors the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their prior consent.There is no automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not known when the high court will decide whether to take Trump's appeal.Writer Jean Carroll and Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump look on as Lawyer John Sauer (not pictured) argues for him, as he is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a $5 million jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of raping her nearly three decades ago, in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 6, 2024, in this court sketch.Jane Rosenberg | ReutersCarroll, in a 2019 New York magazine article, first went public with her allegation that Trump raped her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s.She sued him for allegedly defaming her in comments he made while flatly denying that allegation after the article appeared.Carroll later filed a separate lawsuit accusing Trump of rape and of defaming her again in late 2022 when he commented on her allegations.That second lawsuit was the subject of the trial that ended in May 2023. Jurors in that case did not find Trump liable for rape, but did find him liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her.It is that verdict that Trump has asked the Supreme Court to overturn with the new petition.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks, during the swearing-in ceremony for Sergio Gor as U.S. Ambassador to India, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 10, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\"Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th President, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,\" the petition says.\"Notably, Carroll's allegations are a story that precisely matches the plotline from an episode of one of admittedly her favorite TV shows, 'Law & Order,' \" the petition says.A spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement on the petition, said, \"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes.\"\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, declined to comment on the petition.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe first defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against Trump went to trial after the second lawsuit did.In January 2024, a Manhattan federal court jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll in statements he made as president in 2019 when he denied her claims of rape.That jury ordered him to pay her $83.3 in damages.Trump appealed that verdict.The 2nd Circuit appeals court in September rejected that appeal.\"As observed by the district court, the conduct here supports a significant punitive damages award — it involved malice and deceit, caused severe emotional injury, and continued over at least a five-year period,\" a three-judge panel of the appeals court said in its decision denying Trump's appeal.\"The record in this case supports the district court's determination that the 'the degree of reprehensibility' of Mr. Trump's conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented,' \" the panel said.Trump has filed a petition with the 2nd Circuit asking that the appeal be reheard by a panel comprised of all active judges on the circuit.",

Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.Wright said he expects electricity demand from AI to attract billions of dollars in equity capital to build new nuclear capacity from \"very creditworthy providers.\" The Energy Department could match those private dollars by as much as four to one with low cost debt financing from the loan office, he said.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said.Westinghouse dealThe Trump administration struck a deal last month with the owners of Westinghouse to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the U.S. Westinghouse is owned by uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management.Westinghouse has designed a modern reactor called the AP1000 that can power more than 750,000 homes. CEO Dan Sumner said in July that Westinghouse would meet Trump's call to build large new plants with the AP1000 design.Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said last week that the U.S. government has a number of options available to facilitate the financing of Westinghouse reactors, including the Energy Department's loan office.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" Isaac told investors on Cameco's third-quarter earnings call.Under the terms of the October deal, Westinghouse could spin out as a separate, publicly-traded company with the U.S. government as a shareholder.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to build the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.Two AP1000 reactors entered service at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024, years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The South Carolina project was cancelled.",

    "body": "Paramount Global and Skydance logos are seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. Dado Ruvic | ReutersParamount Skydance said on Monday it expects $1 billion more in merger savings than it previously forecast as it outlines CEO David Ellison's ambitions for the company.The update came in Paramount's third-quarter earnings report — the company's first since its merger closed in early August. Ellison has been investing heavily in streaming and content, including live sports rights, and paying for it in part with cuts to other parts of the business.Paramount on Monday noted layoffs affecting roughly 1,600 employees, tied to divestitures of assets in Argentina and Chile. Late last month, Paramount began the process to lay off another approximately 1,000 employees.At the same time, Paramount said it plans to increase prices for its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, in the first quarter of next year as it looks to beef up its content slate and improve its the technology of the platform.Paramount last raised its streaming prices in June 2024, after a previous hike in early 2023.Shares of the company were up about 6% in extended trading Monday.Cutting to growIn Monday's letter to shareholders, Ellison mapped out the combined company's initiatives, which he referred to as Paramount Skydance's \"North Star priorities.\" Those include investing in its growth businesses, growing its streaming business globally and identifying savings that would lead to \"long-term free cash flow generation.\"While Paramount Skydance management told investors in August they planned $2 billion in cost savings, that was upped to \"at least $3 billion in run-rate efficiencies\" as of Monday's report. More than $1.4 billion of those savings will be done by the end of the year and an additional $1 billion by the end of 2026, according to the letter.The company has been shedding staff. Less than a month after the merger was completed, the company alerted employees that it would be mandating a five-day work week beginning in January and would offer employees a buyout if they didn't want to make the transition. According to Monday's letter, about 600 employees chose to exit the company rather than return to an office full-time.The company also identified parts of its South American business to cut and said Monday it divested Television Federal, the operator of TV stations in Buenos Aires and other markets in Argentina. It's also in the process of exiting Chilevision in Chile, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.These divestitures, which were deemed \"non-core\" to the company's future growth, according to the letter, would result in the 1,600 workforce reductions.Streaming, content in focusParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile Paramount Skydance's restructuring efforts, layoffs and cost savings have been a top priority for the company, Ellison has also wasted no time in making acquisitions to build up its content slate.Most notably, the company has reportedly been looking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would see it gain the Warner Bros. film studio, the HBO Max streaming service, and a portfolio of cable TV networks including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. Discovery recently put itself up for sale, and has rebuffed three offers from Ellison in recent weeks, CNBC reported.Ellison wouldn't comment on his aspirations for WBD on Monday, but said the company was in build mode, which may or may not include mergers and acquisitions.\"I think it's important to know there's no must-haves for us,\" he said. \"We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go.\"On the sports front, Paramount Skydance has added TKO Group's UFC to its slate in a 7-year, $7.7 billion deal. Paramount+ also became the exclusive long-term home for Zuffa Boxing, a new professional boxing promotion formed by TKO and the Saudi-backed Sela, in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.The company also inked a deal with Activision to develop content off of its Call of Duty video game franchise; signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the creators of \"South Park;\" and brought on Matt and Ross Duffer, the creative team behind Netflix's hit \"Stranger Things,\" beginning in mid-2026.The additions to its content slate are geared at boosting Paramount+ streaming subscribers. Paramount Skydance President Jeff Shell said during a call with investors that the service had experienced notable customer losses over the summer, but they returned in the fall at the start of the NFL season.On Monday, the company said Paramount+ had more than 79 million global subscribers.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAMD shares swung on Tuesday after CEO Lisa Su said the company's overall revenue growth would expand to about 35% per year over the next three to five years, driven by \"insatiable\" demand for artificial intelligence chips.Su said that much of that would be captured by the company's AI data center business, which it expects to grow at about 80% per year over the same time period, on track to hit tens of billions of dollars of sales by 2027.\"This is what we see as our potential given the customer traction, both with the announced customers, as well as customers that are currently working very closely with us,\" Su told analysts.Ultimately, Su said that AMD could be able to achieve \"double-digit\" share in the data center AI chip market over the next three to five years.The AI chip market is currently dominated by Nvidia, which has over 90% of the market share, according to some estimates, and which has given the company a market cap of over $4.6 trillion, versus AMD's roughly $387 billion valuation.AMD is holding its first financial analyst day since 2022, as the company has found itself at the center of a boom in data center spending for AI.While companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars in total on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips to build and power artificial intelligence applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, they are also looking for alternatives to increase capacity and control costs. AMD is the only other major developer of GPUs aside from Nvidia.In October, AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI in which it would sell the AI startup billions of dollars in its Instinct AI chips over multiple years, starting with enough chips in 2026 to use 1 gigawatt of power. As part of the deal, OpenAI could end up taking a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Su also highlighted long-term deals with Oracle and Meta on Tuesday.AMD shares have nearly doubled so far in 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

AMD has said that its chips will be able to be assembled into a \"rack-scale\" system where 72 of its chips work together as one, which is essential for running the largest AI models.If AMD succeeds at its rack, it will catch up with Nvidia's AI chips, which have been offered in rack-scale systems for three product generations.Su said that the company now sees the total market for AI data center parts and systems hitting $1 trillion per year in 2030, representing 40% annual growth per year. AMD reported $5 billion in AI chip sales in its fiscal 2024.That's up from the company's previous forecast of a $500 billion market in 2028 for AI chips. But the updated AMD figure also includes central processors (CPU), an important kind of chip that sits at the heart of a computer, but isn't a pure AI accelerator like the GPUs made by Nvidia and AMD.AMD's Epyc CPUs are still the company's most important product by sales. It primarily competes with Intel and some smaller Arm-based processors in the CPU market. AMD also makes chips for game consoles, networking parts, and other devices.On Tuesday, although AMD focused much of its focus on its growing AI business, it told shareholders that its older businesses were growing too.\"The other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders, and that's actually a very nice place to be,\" Su said.watch now",

    "body": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesDemocratic senators on Monday blamed the White House push to fast track artificial intelligence data centers and its attacks on renewable energy for rising electricity prices in certain parts of the U.S.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others demanded that the White House and Commerce Department detail what actions they have taken to shield consumers from the impact of massive data centers in a letter sent Monday.Voters are increasingly feeling the pinch of rising electricity prices. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger campaigned on the issue in the New Jersey and Virgina governors' races, which they won in landslides last week.The senators took aim at the White House's relationship with companies like Meta, Alphabet, Oracle, and OpenAI, and the support the administration has shown for the companies' data center plans.The Trump administration \"has already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand,\" the senators wrote. They accused the White House of making the problem worse by opposing the expansion of solar and wind power.The White House blamed the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices in a statement.President Donald Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.The tech sector's AI plans have ballooned in size. OpenAI and Nvidia, for example, struck a deal in September to build 10 gigawatts of data centers to train and run AI applications. This is equivalent to New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.The scale of these plans have raised questions about whether enough power is available to meet the demand and who will pay for the new generation that is needed. Renewable energy, particularly solar and energy storage, is the power source that can be deployed the quickest right now to meet demand.Retail electricity prices in the U.S. increased about 6% on average through August 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prices, however, can vary widely by region.Download the full letter here. ",

Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe U.S. and Switzerland are getting close to signing a trade deal to lower tariffs of 39% that President Donald Trump slapped on the country in August.The president confirmed on Monday that White House officials were \"working on a deal to get the tariffs a little lower.\"\"I haven't set any number, but we're going to be working on something to help Switzerland,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.\"We hit Switzerland very hard. But we want Switzerland to remain successful,\" he added, saying the country had been a \"very good ally.\"The tariff on Swiss exports could be cut to 15%, matching the rate that was imposed on EU exports to the U.S., according to various media reports citing sources close to the talks. Bloomberg reported that a deal could be finalized within weeks.\"We are not commenting on the ongoing discussions,\" a spokesperson at Switzerland's economy ministry told CNBC, adding that Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin \"is in regular contact with the relevant authorities in the U.S., including USTR Jamieson Greer.\"CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment and is awaiting a response.The duty was met with consternation in Switzerland, whose key exports include watches, jewelry, machinery, chocolate, electronics and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Shares of Swiss firms Swatch Group and Richemont traded higher at the market open on Tuesday.High-profile Swiss businesses have been outspoken on the damage the tariff was wreaking, with the CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling telling CNBC that the duty was \"horrible\" for Switzerland.watch nowThe 39% tariff was among the highest duties that Trump levied in his sweep of global tariffs this year, with the president angered by trade imbalances with the Swiss, and multiple other countries.According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland amounted to $38.5 billion last year. The Swiss government said that the trade relationship between the two was \"relatively balanced,\" according to a CNBC translation.\"The U.S. has a surplus of services exports and Switzerland does for goods exports,\" the government said in August, adding that its goods surplus is not rooted in unfair trade practices and that over 99% of U.S. goods can be imported to Switzerland without being subject to tariffs.",

But it has maintained a 13% tariff on U.S. soybeans.The White House said China will buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of this year and 25 million for each of the next three years.That's still down from the nearly 27 million metric tons China bought in 2024.

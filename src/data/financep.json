    "body": "The Zhipu AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesShares of Knowledge Atlas Technology JSC, better known as Zhipu, edged higher on their Hong Kong debut, following a $558 million initial public offering that made it the first of China's \"AI tigers\" to go public.The stock rose as much as 15% above its offer price of 116.20 Hong Kong Dollars ($15) on Thursday, with around 37.4 million shares on offer by the Beijing-based startup.The IPO valued Zhipu at around HK$4.3 billion, making it one of the larger AI flotations in recent years. Founded in 2019 by researchers from a top Chinese university, Zhipu represents the country's first major large language model company to go public through an IPO. The listing marks another key milestone for China's broader artificial intelligence sector following a wave of recent listings by AI chipmakers. The firm, strongly backed by Beijing, is also considered one of China's so-called \"AI tigers\" — startups building large language models to rival the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Other notable firms in the group include DeepSeek, which famously rattled markets early last year with the release of one of its LLM models. While not as well known globally as DeepSeek, Zhipu gained attention last year when American AI juggernaut OpenAI highlighted its notable progress as a competitor on the \"front line\" of China's race to lead in AI. The firm reportedly has offices  in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and across the Middle East. It also operates joint \"innovation centers\" projects across Southeast Asia, including in Indonesia and Vietnam.Zhipu's progress has come despite being placed on the US Commerce Department's Entity List in January last year, after U.S. officials said it was working with China's military. The firm's ability to train its AI models has also been constrained by U.S. restrictions on access to advanced semiconductor technology and expertise.According to Zhipu's prospectus, it plans to use 70% of the IPO proceeds toward research and development of its general-purpose large AI models. The firm reported revenue of 312.4 million yuan in 2024.Rival Chinese AI start-up MiniMax is expected to launch its own offering on Friday, following a confidential filing last year.",

    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's Samsung Electronics expects its profits to triple in the final three months of last year, reaching a record high, as memory prices surge amid booming demand tied to artificial intelligence. The world's largest memory chipmaker estimated that operating profit reached 20 trillion won and consolidated sales of about 93 trillion won in the fourth quarter, according to an earnings guidance released Thursday. The profit projections mark a significant improvement from a year earlier and would surpass Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018. The surge comes as chipmakers like Nvidia clamor for limited supplies of memory chips used for AI applications. As memory companies prioritize capacity to meet that lucrative demand, it has contributed to a shortage across the broader market, affecting chips used in personal computers and mobile devices.\"The memory market has entered a 'Hyper-Bull' phase, with current conditions eclipsing the historic 2018 peak. Supplier leverage is at an all-time high, driven by an insatiable demand for AI and server capacity,\" Counterpoint Research said in a report Wednesday. The market watcher estimates memory prices surged 40%-50% in the final quarter of 2025, and expects similar gains in the first quarter of 2026, followed by a roughly 20% rise in the second quarter.While these market dynamics have pushed manufacturing costs for most consumer electronics makers, they have been a boon for memory giants like Samsung and its main competitors in the space, SK Hynix and Micron. Samsung shares have gained over 145% over the past 12 months and were up 0.5% on Thursday in choppy trading. The consumer tech giant continues to trail  SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI processors like those from Nvidia. Expanding its HBM production capacity is expected to be a major focus for the company in the new year. Samsung is set to release its audited earnings and hold its quarterly earnings call later this month.",

It will also open a base at McKinney National Airport near Dallas.The union representing flight attendants for Avelo applauded the end of the ICE flights.\"The airline industry is constantly changing, but we've faced far too much change at our airline including operating certain flights we didn't originally sign up for,\" the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the flight attendants' union, said in a statement to members. \"We're hopeful that with the end of the ICE flying and new financing the future is more stable for Flight Attendants at Avelo.\"Avelo said that the near-term schedule changes \"will impact many Customer itineraries\" and said it would reach out via text and email to affected travelers.Levy told staff that the carrier raised \"a substantial amount of new capital\" at the end of the year and that the financial position of the carrier \"has never been stronger.\"",

The president said the purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to improve Venezuela's grid and energy facilities. Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S. after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. The oil will be sold at market prices, Trump said. The sales, if executed, would total more than $2 billion at oil's Wednesday closing price.  Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely. \"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami.\"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said. The funds from the sales will be deposited in U.S. controlled accounts, Wright said. \"We're not taking their oil,\" the energy secretary told CNBC in an interview. The funds from the sales will be brought back to Venezuela, he said. ",

Trump has called for U.S. oil majors to invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. When asked whether the president would deploy troops to protect U.S. oil workers, Leavitt said Trump would do what is in the best interests of the American people and the energy industry. \"It's not something he wants to do, diplomacy is always the first option,\" Leavitt said. The U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela, she said. Trump will meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. The CEOs of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as well as a representative from Chevron are expected to attend the meeting.Energy Secretary Chris Wright will speak with oil executives at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami on Wednesday, a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela, under a special license issued by the U.S. The U.S. ousted President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid over the weekend and took him to New York where he faces charges in a federal drug-trafficking conspiracy indictment.The Trump administration has built up military forces in the Caribbean, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford and its carrier strike group. The president told NBC News on Monday that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Energy analysts say U.S. oil companies will need certainty about the security situation and stability of the government in Venezuela to invest in the country. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The South American country was recently producing about 800,000 barrels per day, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will send 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S., which will be sold at market prices. The energy secretary said Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely.  \"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at Goldman Sachs' energy conference. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesWhen U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. had to take over Greenland as a matter of national security, saying Chinese and Russian ships were \"all over the place\" in the Arctic region, the comments attracted a swift rebuke from Beijing.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday hit back, accusing Washington of \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains.\"Russia, on the contrary, has been notably silent on Trump's Greenland takeover ambitions and his threat to use military force to seize the Arctic island if necessary. The silence emanating from the Kremlin on the Greenland matter could partly be explained by the fact that it's been a holiday period for Russians, with Orthodox Christians celebrating Christmas on Jan. 7. Russia's leadership has yet to comment on the capture of Russian ally Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's leader, last weekend.Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement criticizing the U.S.' \"aggressive actions\" in Venezuela, and on the seizure of a newly Russian-flagged oil tanker in the Atlantic on Wednesday. But it too has been silent when it comes to Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory belonging to Denmark.Moscow has arguably far more reason than China to be vocal about any potential U.S. \"takeover\" of a giant Arctic entity like Greenland, as Russia has had a laser-like focus on rising (and rival) geostrategic interests in the Arctic in recent years.\"We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything,\" Putin said.Sergei Karpukhin | Afp | Getty ImagesThat's with good reason: Russia is the largest Arctic nation by far, spanning 53% of the Arctic Ocean coastline, and it has longstanding geopolitical, strategic and socio-economic interests in the region. The Arctic is a strategic driver of jobs, investment, and growth for the Russian economy with oil, gas, and mineral extraction industries based there, as well as fisheries and infrastructure and transportation logistics, particularly related to the Northern Sea Route — a major Arctic shipping route for Russia between Europe and Asia.Read moreIn addition, Russia maintains its sea-based nuclear deterrent in the Arctic and has a number of military bases and airfields there, as well as a specialized fleet of icebreakers to facilitate trade, transportation, and resource extraction in the territory.NATO division matters more to MoscowRussia's Arctic interests could well be impacted by the U.S.' fixation on Greenland, and in particular, any move to take over the island by force. But analysts told CNBC that Moscow was more interested in seeing its ultimate goal — the destruction of NATO — realised.\"The Russian stake in Greenland is tiny,\" Jamie Shea, former deputy assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges at NATO, told CNBC Wednesday. \"The U.S. would have a larger presence in the North Atlantic [if it increased its presence in Greenland] but NATO is already limiting what Russia can do in the High North with Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the U.K. all increasing their military presence and capability in the region, and Sweden and Finland joining NATO. So not much would change for Russia strategically,\" Shea, an international defense and security expert at think tank Chatham House, added.Danish, Greenlandic and U.S. flags fly at the Danish armed forces' Arctic Command in Nuuk, Greenland March 27, 2025.Leonhard Foeger | ReutersHowever, Putin would be \"delighted to see further divisions and incoherence in NATO and a massive transatlantic crisis that could lead the U.S. to stop its support for Ukraine and withdraw U.S. troops from Europe,\" the analyst noted. Furthermore, if the U.S. were \"tied up in the Western Hemisphere,\" that would ultimately give Russia more space to increase its influence in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe. \"So, on balance, [it would be] a massive win for Putin for which he pays no price,\" Shea said.A 'gift to Putin'Trump's renewed Greenland bid, and the threat that he could resort to using military force to acquire it, have sent shockwaves through NATO and its European member states this week. Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly told Trump that the island is not up for grabs, or up for sale, and that any military action to seize it would spell the end of the NATO alliance. European leaders have also pushed back against Trump, stating that \"it is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet with Danish officials next week. watch nowThe obvious alarm among European leaders, and the growing possibility of NATO's dissolution, are \"an absolute gift to Putin,\" Edward R. Arnold, senior research fellow at RUSI, told CNBC. \"Putin's always known, and Soviet leaders before him knew, that Russia can't defeat NATO militarily. It's too powerful, so it needs to defeat NATO politically, which is basically to make Article Five out to be hollow [and to] try and move the U.S. away from European interests to the point that they can expose that,\" he added.If Greenland's annexation did become a more realistic prospect, \"NATO is effectively going to eat itself politically,\" Arnold added.

That's not a short-term issue.\"Conoco and Exxon filed arbitration cases against Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil industry in 2007. Venezuela owes Conoco about $10 billion and Exxon about $2 billion, according to a JPMorgan note published on Monday. The Trump administration's immediate priority is stabilizing Venezuela, Wright said. \"What we need to do with the revenue from those oil sales is stabilize the economy in Venezuela, stop the collapse of the bolivar, prevent Venezuela from becoming a failed state,\" the energy secretary said. Conoco and Exxon exited Venezuela after the Chavez nationalization. Chevron remained and is the only U.S. oil major operating in the country through a special license issued by the Trump administration.It will take time for U.S. oil majors to invest the billions of dollars needed to rebuild Venezuela's energy infrastructure, Wright said. \"If you're Exxon or Conoco and you've exited the country, you just need normal, commercial business conditions, rule of law and some security to go back in. That will take some time,\" he said. The Trump administration will work with Chevron on \"incremental tweaks or changes\" to enable their production to grow, he said. Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short to medium term, Wright said earlier at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami. The energy secretary said the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely.\"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil, and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at the Goldman conference. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said.Trump will meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday, sources told CNBC's Sullivan. The CEOs of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as well as a representative from Chevron are expected to attend the meeting.",

Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesA Democrat-led push to extend recently expired Obamacare subsidies cleared a procedural hurdle in the House on Wednesday with support from nine Republicans, teeing up a final vote later this week.The House voted 221-205 in favor of a motion to discharge a bill that, if passed by the House and Senate, would extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plan holders for three years. Those tax credits were first implemented in 2021 under President Joe Biden as a pandemic-era relief measure and expired at the end of 2025, resulting in premium hikes for millions of Americans. Congressional Republicans, who have largely opposed extending the subsidies, find themselves in a difficult position ahead of the 2026 midterms, as Democrats seek to make health care and affordability central campaign issues.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep. Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ouster\"The American people want us to work on the affordability crisis,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu, Democratic Caucus vice chair, at a Wednesday press conference before the vote.\"We know that healthcare costs are skyrocketing, food prices continue to increase and electricity rates in a number of areas are surging,\" Lieu said. \"And what is Donald Trump focused on? In his words 'running Venezuela.'\"The House is expected to vote on the underlying measure to extend the ACA enhanced tax credits on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., introduced the discharge petition in November after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to bring a vote on extending the subsidies. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows rank-and-file members to circumvent leadership and force legislation to the floor with majority support.Over Johnson's objections, four moderate House Republicans signed the petition in December, lifting Jeffries' effort over the 218-signature threshold. The Republican defections were a blow to Johnson, whose authority was undermined last year by a series of successful discharge petitions, including one that compelled the release of files related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Uncertainty in the SenateBut the outlook for the enhanced ACA tax credits across the Capitol remains murky and time is short. ACA open enrollment in most states ends Jan. 15, though some lawmakers, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Congress could consider extending the election period if a solution does not materialize in time.The Senate in December rejected a similar measure that would have extended the subsidies for three years. A second attempt at a three-year extension is not expected to fare any better.Instead, a bipartisan Senate working group has been attempting to find a compromise on the issue. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, among those involved in the talks, said on Wednesday the House bill would fail in the Senate but serve as a vehicle for lawmakers to amend the proposal.Moreno said they were \"in the red zone,\" adding that the working group could not afford to drag out negotiations for several more weeks. House and Senate moderates are set to meet Thursday to discuss the enhanced ACA tax credits, Punchbowl News reported Tuesday.To get majority support in the Senate, any deal will need to take into account several issues that persist. Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday said that includes addressing $0 premiums, which were expanded in 2021 thanks to the enhanced ACA tax credits, and creating a \"bridge\" to greater Health Savings Accounts access, which Trump has made a priority.\"An expansion of HSAs so that you're getting more money into the pockets of the American people, the patients if you will, the consumers, as opposed to the insurance companies,\" Thune said.Perhaps the biggest sticking point is over the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old policy that prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions that pro-life groups and some Republicans want to strengthen.At a House GOP retreat on Tuesday, Trump instructed congressional Republicans to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde Amendment, spurring anger from pro-life groups and push back from staunchly anti-abortion Republicans. \"We don't do federal funding for abortions,\" Moreno said. \"That's a long-standing tradition, nobody's looking to change that.\"-- CNBC's Karen Sloane contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during the Future Decoded Tech Summit in Bengaluru, India, on Feb. 25, 2020. Microsoft will open a new data-center region in Spain, expanding their strategic partnership with Telefonica SA, according the the statement by Telefonica.Samyukta Lakshmi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has identified itself as the mystery company behind a prospective data center in a part of Michigan where locals have objected to such a development. On Wednesday, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure team was named in a letter, published by Lowell Charter Township, as the party eyeing a 237-acre lot beside Interstate 96. The township, with a population of around 6,500, is located 20 miles southeast of Grand Rapids.The letter came after weeks of speculation about who was collaborating with developer Franklin Partners for the controversial project. Franklin, based in Illinois, had previously said it was working with a national company based in the U.S. to build a data center on the land. In December, locals crowded into a planning commission meeting, where a public hearing on the proposed rezoning was on the agenda, leading to the postponement of the event. News outlet MLive reported that a Grand Rapids business owner appeared in a Mr. Peanut costume and held up a sign saying \"This is nuts.\" Some in the area have said the township was moving too quickly to rezone the land, given the absence of clarity surrounding issues like energy requirements to operate the facility. Days after the canceled meeting, local officials said they were temporarily holding off on moving forward with the project.\"We are introducing ourselves now because we have observed that the community would like more information about the proposal, and we believe it is important to be transparent about our intentions moving forward,\" Microsoft said in Wednesday's letter. \"We asked the seller to pause the rezone process so that we could spend time with the community early this year and share more about our potential long-term plans before we proceed.\"Microsoft is set to nearly double the size of its data center portfolio in the next two years, CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in October. It's among a group of industry heavyweights, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Oracle, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI, rushing to spin up data centers packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units and other infrastructure needed to run powerful artificial intelligence models and workloads. Tech's megacaps are collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to capital expenditures, raising concerns that they're fueling another industry bubble. Utilities in some U.S. markets have said they won't be able to supply the energy needed for these planned data centers, which has made site selection more difficult. Residents living near the sites of proposed facilities have been pushing back, citing a range of concerns.Water use is one of the key issues. The Michigan township said it has an agreement with the nearby city of Lowell to provide a path for increased \"capacity of the plant at no additional cost to rate payers.\" Consumers Energy, a utility serving millions of Michiganders, has said data centers will not lead to higher electricity rates.The lot in the Covenant Business Park in the township is zoned as industrial planned unit development, and has sat empty, in part because of a lack of water and sewer services. The township's board would have to approve to change the zoning to light industrial for the project to advance.The development would result in $500 million to $1 billion in investment over the course of three to five years, the township said.The planning commission is set to meet again on Jan. 12.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. should bar large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans.\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday.\"It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" he added.Private equity giants, real estate investment trusts and other large institutional investors have amassed sizable portfolios of single-family rental homes over the past decade. Many have argued that these investments have reduced housing supply for would-be homeowners and helped drive up prices. Invitation Homes, which is the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, tumbled 6%. Shares of Blackstone, an investing firm that owns and rents single-family homes, dropped more than 5%. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management also declined over 5%.The national median existing single-family home price was $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025 after hitting a record high of $435,300 in the summer, according to the National Association of Realtors. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily.Blackstone was the largest private-equity owner of apartments in the U.S. with more than 230,000 units, according to data from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project released last year. Blackstone in recent years has spent billions acquiring real estate companies such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities.Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. Trump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.Senator Tim Scott, head of the committee overseeing housing in the Senate, said while he embraced Trump's push for affordability, the better way to go forward would be his bipartisan \"ROAD to Housing\" bill.\"2026 must be the year we get housing affordability right for working families. I welcome President Trump's desire to look for ways to create more homeowners, especially first-time homeowners,\" Scott said in a statement to CNBC's Emily Wilkins. \"My focus is on advancing meaningful solutions that expand housing supply and lower costs — including building on our unanimously passed ROAD to Housing Act — because that's how we make the American Dream more attainable.\"— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Chinese officials are reviewing Meta's $2 billion acquisition of AI startup Manus for possible technology control violations, FT reported on Tuesday.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesChina said Thursday it will investigate Meta's $2 billion acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus to assess its compliance with export control laws.Meta acquired Singapore-based Manus last month as the U.S. tech giant looks to integrate advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition.China's Ministry of Commerce said it will conduct an assessment and investigation into how the acquisition complies with laws and regulations concerning export controls, technology import and export, and overseas investment, according to a statement translated by Google.\"The Chinese government consistently supports enterprises in conducting mutually beneficial transnational operations and international technological cooperation in accordance with laws and regulations,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said at a press briefing.CNBC has contacted Meta and Manus for comment.watch nowManus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity, which relocated to Singapore earlier this year. The startup was hailed as the next DeepSeek after it launched its first AI agent in March, which can help with tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis. The company reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July as it eyed global expansion. Manus said the Meta acquisition would see the company continue to operate from Singapore. The startup said it had 105 employees across the South Asian nation, Tokyo, and San Francisco in December.Manus said it had passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in December, eight months on from launching a product, which it claimed made it the fastest startup in the world to hit the milestone from $0.\"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,\" Meta said in a statement in December. The acquisition follows the company raising $75 million in a round led by U.S. VC Benchmark in April. China's probe \"underlines that [the country] considers advanced AI agents, models and related IP to be strategic assets,\" Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The most likely outcome I see is a lengthier approval process and potential conditions around how Manus technology developed in China can be used, rather than an outright block, but the threat of stricter action gives Beijing bargaining power in a high profile, US led acquisition,\" he added.Meta's AI expansionMeta's Manus acquisition comes as the company has spent billions of dollars building out AI capabilities in the face of advances from rivals OpenAI and Google. In June, the company invested $14.3 billion in a 49% stake in AI startup Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang onto the tech giant's leadership team. Meta also announced it was acquiring AI wearable startup Limitless in December.Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has been deprioritizing the company's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit in favor of its more product-oriented GenAI team to help Meta make headway in AI and improve its Llama family of AI models, CNBC previously reported.",

Xny/star Max | Gc Images | Getty ImagesMore than 100 people were killed during the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife, the country's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Wednesday.It was the first time a Venezuelan government official publicly provided a death toll from the operation, as additional details emerged about the mission, which U.S. President Donald Trump described as \"perfectly executed.\"\"So far — and I say so far — there are 100 dead. One hundred. And a similar number injured,\" Cabello said. Two senior Venezuelan officials had previously told MS Now that more than 70 people were killed in the raid.Cabello also said both Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were injured during the operation. MS Now earlier reported that Maduro was hurt after falling while attempting to flee. Two U.S. sources told the outlet that Flores was struck in the head during the raid.Cuba revealed on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed during the operation, adding that those individuals were carrying out missions for Cuba's armed forces and interior ministry. The statement was posted by Cuba's presidential office on Facebook.Special operations forces from multiple service branches and more than 150 military aircraft were involved in the capture of Maduro.Seven U.S. service members were injured during the military operation, a Pentagon official told MS Now on Wednesday.Two of the seven are still recovering, while five have recovered from their injuries sustained in the operation dubbed \"Absolute Resolve.\"\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the official said.The official said an assessment of casualties on the ground was still ongoing and is being led by the U.S. intelligence community.U.S. President Donald Trump said the military action was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, according to a post on Truth Social on Saturday.The U.S. strikes followed weeks of military buildup in the region and repeated threats by Trump against Maduro.The deposed leader appeared in a New York court on Monday, where he said he had been \"kidnapped\" with his wife by U.S. forces from his home in Caracas and described himself as a \"prisoner of war.\" He pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.— CNBC's Lim Hui Jie and MS Now's Julia Jester contributed to this report.watch now",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesAfter an all-time high and a big tumble for bitcoin last year, industry executives and investors told CNBC that the cryptocurrency could reach new heights in 2026 — but with the potential for huge volatility.In CNBC's annual roundup of bitcoin predictions, several commentators forecast a wide range of prices for bitcoin in 2026, dropping as low as $75,000 and rising as high as $225,000.Last October, bitcoin hit a record high of over $126,000 before falling later in the year to lows of around $80,000, according to CoinMetrics. Bitcoin is sitting around 30% lower than its all-time high. Last year's crypto market was buoyed by what was viewed as a more favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. under President Donald Trump, and increasing interest from larger institutional investors and traditional financial players like banks. Meanwhile, there was a boom in so-called digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, which accumulate large amounts of bitcoin and other digital coins. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin price over the last year.At the same time, debate continues over the valuations of technology stocks and whether the artificial intelligence boom will turn into a bubble. The crypto sell-off at the end of the year came against that backdrop. As investors reassessed risk assets and crypto holders sold digital currencies, there were forced liquidations, which exacerbated the selling. This has created a tough backdrop for 2026.\"We are in a complex investing environment. Equity valuations are stretched, the geopolitical environment is chaotic and evolving, there are fears about the near-term durability of AI capex deployment, monetary policy conditions appear to be shifting, and the U.S. midterm elections are on the horizon,\" Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy, told CNBC. \"Against this backdrop, the outlook for bitcoin in 2026 is tough to predict.\"Here are some of the boldest forecasts for the price of bitcoin in 2026.Carol Alexander: $75,000-$150,000In 2026, bitcoin will remain in a \"high-volatility range\" of between $75,000 and $150,000, \"with the centre of gravity around\" $110,000, according to Carol Alexander, professor of finance at the University of Sussex.That's \"as the market digests a transition from retail-led cycles to institutionally distributed liquidity.\" Historically, bitcoin's price has been driven by retail traders. But over the past two years, an increasing number of institutional investors have been involved in the space. Many cryptocurrency experts expect this to continue this year.Alexander has had a good track record in her bitcoin predictions over the last few years. But, she previously said bitcoin could hit $200,000 in 2026, which did not materialize. She did however, say that by the summer of 2025, bitcoin could be trading \"around $150,000 plus or minus $50,000.\" Indeed, during the summer of 2025, bitcoin was trading above $100,000. CoinShares: $120,000-$170,000James Butterfill, head of research for crypto-focused asset manager CoinShares, expects to see bitcoin in a range of between $120,000 and $170,000 in 2026, with \"more constructive price action likely occurring in the second half of the year.\"Butterfill said investors will be watching to see who the new chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve will be after Jerome Powell's tenure ends in May. The new person is \"likely to be dovish,\" but markets will wait for clarity \"before repricing risk assets more decisively,\" Butterfill said.Investors are also focusing on whether a piece of legislation in the U.S. known as the Clarity Act will become law in 2026. The Clarity Act seeks to create a framework for regulating digital assets. \"Regulation has been a persistent overhang; resolution here would be a meaningful catalyst,\" Butterfill said.Butterfill cited risks such as inflation shocks or policy errors from the Fed as reasons why there might be demand for \"alternative, non-sovereign monetary assets\" like bitcoin. In December 2024, Butterfill forecast that bitcoin could fall to around $80,000 in 2025, which it did. He also said bitcoin could rise as high as $150,000 last year, which it did not manage to achieve. Standard Chartered: $150,000Standard Chartered has a bitcoin price forecast of $150,000 for 2026, which it cut in December from a previous call of $300,000. Geoff Kendrick, the bank's global head of digital asset research, said that the price decline seen in 2025 was \"within expected bounds.\" However, the price action has led Standard Chartered to revise its call.\"Specifically, we think buying by Bitcoin digital asset treasury companies (DATs) is likely over, as valuations ... no longer support further Bitcoin DAT expansion. We expect a consolidation rather than outright selling, but DAT buying is unlikely to provide further support,\" Kendrick said in his note from December.watch nowDATs are entities that buy and hold cryptocurrency, mainly bitcoin, and attempt to outperform the market. However, a plunge in crypto prices has hurt the valuations of these firms, which some analysts have suggested may undermine their ability to raise additional funding. Kendrick suggests these DATs are unlikely to be buying the same amount of bitcoin as before to support the market.Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which allow investors to track the price of the digital currency without owning the underlying asset, are likely to drive prices in 2026, according to Kendrick. \"As a result, we now think future Bitcoin price increases will effectively be driven by one leg only – ETF buying,\" Kendrick said. Maple Finance: $175,000Sidney Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, said he has a price target of $175,000 for bitcoin this year, buoyed by interest rate cuts and \"increasing institutional adoption of bitcoin.\" In December 2024, Powell predicted there would be some corrections to the price in 2025, which did indeed occur. He also had a bullish 2025 call for bitcoin of between $180,000 and $200,000, which was not achieved. However, he said a big milestone for bitcoin in 2026 will be when bitcoin-backed lending exceeds $100 billion. \"Bitcoin holders are increasingly sophisticated, they don't want to sell their BTC; they want to borrow against it. This creates a virtuous cycle: less selling pressure, more utility, higher prices.\"Bit Mining: $75,000 to $225,000 Youwei Yang, chief economist at Bit Mining, is also predicting continued volatility with bitcoin. Yang said he expects a wide trading range for bitcoin in 2026 of between $75,000 and $225,00. \"2026 could be a strong year for Bitcoin, supported by potential rate cuts and a more accommodating regulatory stance toward crypto,\" Yang said. \"However, heightened volatility is likely amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.\" In December 2024, Yang's previous call was partially correct. He predicted that bitcoin could fall to around $80,000 in 2025, which it did. He also forecast it could trade between $180,000 and $190,000, which did not materialize. Nexo: $150,000-$200,000Nexo's 2025 call of $250,000 for bitcoin \"was less a rejection of its long-term thesis and more a consequence of market mechanics colliding with a shifting macro backdrop,\" according to Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at the cryptocurrency exchange. Kalchev said this price didn't materialize as long-term holders who accumulated bitcoin at lower prices began to sell, which was then purchased by institutional investors.But 2026 \"appears more constructive,\" Kalchev said with the phase of long-term holders selling their holdings coming to an end and institutional allocations \"gradually rise from still-modest levels.\" \"Bitcoin is entering 2026 with less supply risk and a broader capital base,\" Kalchev said.If financial conditions turn more supportive – through easing policy, a softer dollar, or renewed liquidity expansion – Bitcoin could revisit and exceed prior highs,\" he added.

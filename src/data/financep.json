Revenue increased 10.8% to $28.24 billion.Shares of the bank rose almost 5% in premarket trading. They've climbed roughly 14% this year before Wednesday.Like its peers, Bank of America's Wall Street businesses helped fuel the quarter's results.Banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported strong gains in trading and investment banking revenue during the third quarter on heightened activity among both institutional investors and corporations looking to acquire companies or raise capital.Bank of America said investment banking fees surged 43% from a year earlier to $2 billion, about $380 million more than analysts surveyed by StreetAccount had expected.Equities trading also contributed to the quarterly beat; revenue there rose 14% to $2.3 billion, roughly $200 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.Fixed income trading rose 5% to $3.1 billion, matching expectations.Bank of America also benefited from an improved outlook around credit losses in the quarter. The company said its provision for credit losses fell about 13% to $1.3 billion, which is below the $1.58 billion StreetAccount estimate.Net interest income rose 9% to $15.39 billion, about $150 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.\"With continued organic growth, every line of business reported top and bottom-line improvements,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the earnings release. \"Strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with effective balance sheet positioning, resulted in record net interest income.\"This story is developing.

    "body": "Gold prices edged lower on Wednesday as caution prevailed ahead of the U.S. consumer price inflation report that could provide more clarity on the Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAs the peak holiday shopping season approaches, most U.S. consumers have a downbeat outlook on the economy, according to an annual Deloitte survey published on Wednesday.Most consumers surveyed — 57% — said they expect the economy to weaken in the year ahead, the consulting firm found in a poll of roughly 4,000 respondents. That compares to 30% who expected a weaker economy ahead of the year-ago holiday season and 54% in 2008, one of the years of the Great Recession.It marks the most negative economic outlook since Deloitte began tracking that in 1997.Seventy-seven percent of people surveyed said they expect higher prices on holiday items, up from 69% last year, according to Deloitte. It's the first holiday season since President Donald Trump's latest wave of tariff hikes on many imports.\"We've been talking about the resilient consumer for a while now, that despite all these pressures, the U.S. consumer continues to spend and we keep seeing growth and spending for retail,\" said Brian McCarthy, retail strategy leader for Deloitte. \"This outlook is starting to suggest that we're getting towards the end of that resilience.\"Consumers' pessimistic mindset has factored into their spending plans during the holiday season. They plan to spend an average of $1,595, 10% less than the $1,778 they planned to spend in the year-ago period, as they brace for higher prices, according to the Deloitte survey.The lower anticipated spending cuts across all household income groups and nearly all generations, Deloitte found. Yet it was especially significant among younger shoppers.Gen Z consumers, which in the survey were between ages 18 and 28, said they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season than a year ago. Millennials, respondents between age 29 and 44 in the poll, said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.That compares to Gen X, which plans to spend an average of 3% more, and Baby Boomers, who expect to spend an average of 6% less.For Gen Z shoppers, the tighter holiday budget likely comes from feeling more uncertain and unstable early in their careers, McCarthy said.\"They're thinking about income and the job market and the concerns about the economy is going to throw a lot more pressure on them because they haven't yet had time to sort of build up their savings or plan for less rosy economic environments,\" he said.Mike Daher, U.S. consumer industry leader for Deloitte, said the age group is also \"exposed to a lot of inflationary pressures around housing costs,\" along with higher prices of everyday items like groceries.For retailers and brands, the findings add a note of caution to the most crucial sales period of the year. Other holiday forecasts have also found households expect to spend less during the holidays, while still reflecting consumers' appetite for decorating and giving gifts during the festive season.Holiday spending across stores and online is expected to rise 4% year over year, according to consulting firm Bain & Co., a drop from the 10-year average of 5.2% growth. A separate Adobe Analytics report found online holiday spending in the U.S. is expected to grow 5.3% year over year, but that would be slower than the year-ago increase of 8.7% year over year.Like Deloitte's poll, consulting firm PwC's survey indicated a holiday pullback among Gen Z consumers, who said they planned to spend 23% less than during the year-ago period. Overall, consumers said they expect to spend about 5% less – or an average total of $1,552 – on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment compared with the year-ago season, according to the PwC survey.The National Retail Federation, the major industry trade group, plans to share its holiday forecast in early November.Though holiday outlooks have varied, one of the dominant themes of this holiday season will be value-seeking, Deloitte's McCarthy said. Even in the past several months, the firm has found a notable uptick in the number of U.S. consumers who have reported seeking deals. Across income groups, Deloitte's survey indicated that seven in 10 respondents are engaging in three or more deal-seeking behaviors, such as purchasing store brands or alternative ingredients, cooking more meals at home and buying used cars.As consumers watch their budgets, they told Deloitte they will cut back on holiday-related extras. On average, consumers said they plan to spend 22% less on non-gift holiday expenses, such as hosting, clothing and decor.For gifts, however, the cut wasn't as deep. On average, survey respondents said they plan to buy eight gifts compared to nine in the year-ago period and spend $536 compared to $505 in the prior-year holiday season.",

Violeta Santos Moura | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of trying to weaken the global economy by slapping export controls on resources vital for technology.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent said the moves over rare earths and minerals are an attempt by China \"to pull everyone else down with them.\"\"If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most,\" he said.The move by China comes just ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. In an Oct. 9 announcement Beijing said it won't allow the export of rare earths materials for military use, the first time it has targeted that specific use. The U.S. uses rare earths magnets for many of its most important weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Tomahawk missiles and smart bombs.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 and has threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi. Markets have been volatile since the dispute escalated, with Wall Street stock averages down sharply to start the day Tuesday.\"They are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they're exacerbating their standing in the world,\" Bessent told the FT.",

Wang Zhao | Afp | Getty ImagesAutonomous driving firms Pony.ai and WeRide have received approval from China's securities regulator for secondary listings in Hong Kong, as the companies look to raise funds and continue their global expansion. The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced Tuesday that both companies had filed to issue and list shares in Hong Kong. Chinese companies seeking a foreign listing are required to file an application with the CSRC in advance, giving the regulators final say on whether the company can go public overseas.Pony.ai and WeRide, which are already listed in the United States, can issue about 102 million new shares each for their Hong Kong listings.WeRide has tapped Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corporation to work on the listing, according to a Reuters report. Neither WeRide nor Pony.ai immediately responded to CNBC's inquiry on their IPO plans. Pony.ai CEO James Peng had told CNBC in July that the company was exploring a Hong Kong listing. Hong Kong would offer \"close proximity\" to the company's home market of China, which is something that would interest a lot of investors, Peng said. Pony.ai and WeRide, both headquartered in Guangzhou, are amongst a growing wave of Chinese companies seeking secondary listings in Hong Kong, in what has been a bounce-back year for the city's IPO market.The Chinese companies' move to dual list also comes as they expand their presence to new regions, including the Middle East, Europe and Asian countries such as Singapore, although they have yet to receive full approvals to operate their robotaxis in most of those regions. In the U.S., both companies have partnered with Uber, with hopes of deploying their robotaxis on the firm's ride-hailing platform after receiving approval. In China, they have already begun operating fully autonomous robotaxis in major cities, which can be hailed via their respective apps. The companies have smaller autonomous vehicle fleets when compared to more established players such as Baidu's Apollo Go in China and Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S.Pony.ai launched its IPO in November with shares priced at $13 apiece — the stock has gained more than 60% since. WeRide debuted on the Nasdaq, with the IPO priced at $15.50 a share in October 2024, and its stock has lost over 30% so far.",

    "body": "Newly-elected leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Sanae Takaichi shakes hands with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after winning the LDP leadership election in Tokyo, Japan, on Oct. 04, 2025.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUnder normal circumstances in Japan, the leader of the governing party would be the prime minister, particularly between election cycles.But these are not normal times in Tokyo, with outgoing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba staying on in a caretaker role after resigning on Sept. 7.Sanae Takaichi, the current president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the woman poised to become the country's first female prime minister, faces a tougher path to power after the abrupt exit of coalition partner Komeito.Komeito's abrupt withdrawal from the ruling coalition on Oct. 10 left the LDP with an even smaller minority in the Diet, Japan's parliament, and opened the door for a potential opposition upset.A vote to choose the next prime minister was initially scheduled for Wednesday, but Komeito's pullout forced a postponement of the extraordinary session of the Diet to Oct. 21, according to local media reports.Potential unity candidateBefore the collapse of the ruling coalition last Friday, opposition unity appeared unlikely.But over the weekend, the Japan Times reported that the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) planned to seek Komeito's backing for a joint prime ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), the fourth-largest party in the Lower House, ruled out forming a new coalition with the LDP. DPP's leader Yuichiro Tamaki reportedly said he would be willing to serve as Prime Minister if nominated by the CDP.Other local media reports have also said Tamaki could emerge as a consensus candidate for the opposition to coalesce around.The LDP remains the largest voting bloc in the chamber, holding 196 seats in the 465-seat Lower House.A note from Bank of America said attention will center on the runoff round of the two-stage vote for prime minister, in which the top two finishers in the first ballot face off if no candidate wins an outright majority. If the Lower and Upper Houses choose different candidates, the Lower House's selection takes precedence.\"Although they are struggling to unite, the three major opposition parties...together hold more seats than the LDP. We therefore need to monitor the debate on which individual parties (including Komeito) intend to support in the runoff-round vote,\" the BofA note wrote.If the CDP, DPP and Nippon Ishin unite, they will hold 210 seats, still short of the 233 needed for a majority, but surpassing the 196 held by the LDP.A blessing in disguise?However, some analysts said that the collapse of the ruling coalition could be a blessing in disguise for the LDP.The end of the LDP-Komeito partnership might free the LDP to push long-delayed policy goals, Tomohiko Taniguchi, Special Advisor at the Fujitsu Future Studies Center, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"He noted that when Komeito was in the Japanese Cabinet, the LDP had to make concessions, especially when it came to social issues.\"But with the Komeito now out, the LDP under Takaichi, if she becomes Prime Minister, will be able to pursue policies the LDP has long wanted to pursue, including some of the tax breaks and changes in the tax system,\" Taniguchi said.Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of the Democratic Party for the People, outside the National Diet building in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, Aug. 1, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJesper Koll, expert director at Monex Group, said that Komeito, with its dwindling support, has \"outlived its purpose\" for the LDP.\"Takaichi is forcing the issue, and thereby actually laying the direction for a new LDP,\" Koll said.But other analysts were more critical of Takaichi. A November 13 note from Quantum Strategy described Takaichi's leadership as faltering, saying she has \"made a complete pigs' breakfast of it\" by losing the LDP's coalition partner of 26 years.Even if she secures the premiership, Quantum warned she may be a \"lame duck\" leader with limited ability to govern.Barring a snap election, the next general election is not due until October 2028.",

Jens Schlueter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAutomotive industry groups have raised the alarm over the ramifications of China's latest move to restrict critical rare earth exports, saying the measures could pave the way to a period of supply chain chaos.China's Commerce Ministry last week announced expanded curbs on the export of rare earths and related technologies, seeking to prevent the \"misuse\" of minerals in the military and other sensitive sectors.Beijing has since defended the policy, saying it was \"not afraid\" of a U.S. trade war after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.Despite an agreement in July designed to fast-track shipments to the region, Europe's auto industry has been experiencing significant disruption after China imposed rare earth export curbs in early April.The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, said China's new regulations were expected to have \"far-reaching consequences for deliveries of the affected products to Germany and Europe,\" as well as for their onward transport.China's latest export restrictions will hit the battery and semiconductor industries \"particularly hard, and thus also the automotive industry,\" the VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email on Tuesday.The German car industry lobby called on policymakers in both Brussels and Berlin to tackle the issue \"forcefully\" with China to quickly find a viable solution.\"The fact is that the Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and permanent magnets implemented in April this year have already significantly exacerbated the supply situation for rare earths and strategic materials. The new measures now go even further,\" the VDA spokesperson said.Neodymium is displayed at the Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. factory in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China, on Wednesday, May 5, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth metals are vital components to the production of electric vehicles, as well as various high-tech applications, including electronics and renewable energy applications.Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.Depleted reservesRoberto Vavassori, chairman of the Italian auto part maker lobby ANFIA, reportedly said Tuesday that while manufacturers had been able to maintain production when China restricted supplies over the summer, reserves of rare earth metals were now at risk of being depleted.This buffer \"is not there anymore,\" Vavassori said at a conference in Milan, according to Reuters. ANFIA did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said China's new crackdown on exports is pressing from a supply chain perspective.\"China dominates 90% of global refinery capacity and therefore it's a real bottleneck,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"Across the supply chain there are still inventories, such as at Tradium's major storage facility near Frankfurt, so I don't expect immediate large fallouts already,\" Luman said.\"But rare earths include a range of elements, some could run short in delivery. And going forward relaxation of supplies is highly dependent on upcoming talks between China,\" he added.",

Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmericans have vastly different views of the economy — and the divergence is being driven in part by income bracket, data shows.Higher-income consumers were more likely to report stronger economic confidence readings when asked to consider the next year given changes since the presidential election, according to JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey.This release adds to a growing body of qualitative and quantitative evidence showing the U.S. economy is in a \"K-shape,\" a term used by economists to describe the deviation in economic experiences by income. In other words, it can explain why well-off Americans are continuing to spend while lower earners buckle under inflationary pressures.\"Survey results indicated a notable bifurcation,\" JPMorgan's Matthew Boss, a widely followed and respected consumer analyst, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10, underscoring their rosy financial outlook.On the other hand, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Less than a quarter of participants in this category provided a score between 7 and 10, which Boss pointed out creates a 30-point delta between these groups.Across income brackets, the average respondent rated their confidence at a 4.9 out of 10 rating.This income-based division was once again prevalent when consumers were asked about their confidence for covering monthly bills compared with six to 12 months ago.Nearly 6 of 10 high-income consumers said these bills were easier or becoming easier to cover. But just 37% and 30% of middle- and lower-income groups, respectively, said the same.Higher-income respondents were also more likely to say they were planning to increase spending on nonessential items over the next year than other brackets, according to JPMorgan's survey.JPMorgan isn't the only organization seeing a disparity between income classes when it comes to their economic outlook.The top one-third of earners have reported an average consumer sentiment rating that's around 25% higher than the lowest one-third over the last two years, according to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer survey. The Michigan survey's most recent results reflect interviews conducted July 29-Aug. 25 of a statistically representative sample of about 1,000 American households.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, and provided a few hints that more interest rate cuts are in the cards.Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with \"quantitative tightening,\" or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet.While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications the Fed is nearing its goal of \"ample\" reserves available for banks.\"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,\" Powell said in prepared remarks. \"We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.\"On interest rates, the central bank chief did not provide specific guidance on a path lower, but comments about weakness in the labor market indicated that easing is firmly on the table, as financial markets expect.\"If we move too quickly, then we may leave the inflation job unfinished and have to come back later and finish it. If we move too slowly, there may be unnecessary losses, painful losses, in the employment market. So we're in the difficult situation of balancing those two things,\" he said.\"The data we got right after the July meeting showed that ... that the labor market has actually softened pretty considerably, and puts us in a situation where the two risks are closer to being in balance,\" Powell added.Other Fed officials have said recently that the falling labor market is taking precedence in their thinking, leading to the likelihood of additional rate cuts ahead.Balance sheet mathPowell, though, centered most of his speech on the Fed's holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets.When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for \"abundant\" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for \"ample\" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system.During the Covid pandemic, the central bank had aggressively purchased Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the balance sheet to close to $9 trillion.Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. The question had been how far the Fed needed to go, and Powell's comments indicate that the end is close.He noted that \"some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening\" and could be signaling that reducing reserves further would hinder growth. However, he also said the Fed has no plans to go back to its pre-Covid balance sheet size, which was closer to $4 trillion.On a related matter, Powell noted concerns over the Fed continuing to pay interest on bank reserves.The Fed normally remits interest it earns from its holdings to the Treasury general fund. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have suggested terminating the payments on reserves.However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy.\"While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history,\" he said. \"If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates.\"Views on the economyOn the larger issue of interest rates, Powell generally stuck to the recent script, namely that policymakers are concerned that the labor market is tightening and skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation.\"While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation,\" he said. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\"Powell noted that the Federal Open Market Committee responded in September to the situation with a quarter percentage point reduction on the federal funds rate. While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal.\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" he said.The Fed has been hampered somewhat by the government shutdown and the impact it has had on economic data releases. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions.Powell said the Fed is continuing to analyze conditions based on the data that is available.\"Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,\" Powell said. \"Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week.Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.",

The companies said more markets outside of the U.S. are in the pipeline.\"This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\" Spotify's Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller said in a statement. \"Together with Netflix, we're expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences, and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.\"Lauren Smith, Netflix's vice president of content licensing and programming strategy, said the curated selection \"adds fresh voices and new perspectives to Netflix.\"The shows coming to Netflix include \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables\" and \"Serial Killers,\" with more expected after the initial launch.Spotify said the move is the next step in evolving the company into a multimedia experience, with more initiatives planned in the future to \"bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators.\"Tuesday's announcement comes as media companies have turned to video podcasts as the next big thing among their audiences. In particular, video podcasts have soared in popularity on Google's YouTube, which is increasingly nabbing a bigger share of viewership.This has led traditional media and streaming companies to lean into the medium.At this year's Upfront advertising presentations, some companies, including Amazon's Prime Video, noted the recent success of podcast content as creators sign multimillion dollar deals and garner millions of followers and views.On an April earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is \"constantly looking at all different types of content.\" Sarandos added that the line between podcasts and talk shows is becoming increasingly blurred. \"We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love,\" Sarandos said. \"Podcasts ... have become a lot more video-forward.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdult ChatGPT users can soon access a less censored version of the artificial intelligence chatbot, which will include erotic materials, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced in an apparent policy shift.\"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" Altman said in a social media post on Tuesday. Though it remains unclear what material will qualify as permitted erotica, the move could represent a major shift in OpenAI's policy, which formerly prohibited such content in most contexts.According to Altman, existing versions of ChatGPT were made \"pretty restrictive\" to protect users from mental health risks, but that approach made the chatbot \"less useful [and enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems. \"Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,\" he said.Those \"new tools\" appear to refer to safety features and parental controls rolled out last month to address concerns over how the chatbot was impacting young users' mental health. watch nowHowever, as safeguards for minors expand, it appears that Altman is ready for ChatGPT to take a looser approach for adults. OpenAI hinted at a shift in February when language on its \"Model Spec\" page was updated to clarify that, in order to \"maximize freedom\" for users, only sexual content involving minors was prohibited. Still, erotica was considered to be \"sensitive content\" to be generated only in certain permitted contexts.Besides the rollout in December, Altman also said a new version of ChatGPT will launch in the coming weeks, allowing the chatbot to adopt more distinct personalities — building on updates in the latest GPT‑4o version.\"If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it,\" he said. \"But only if you want it.\"Growth vs. safety After Altman's post on Tuesday, some social media users were quick to point out his previous statements suggesting that ChatGPT wouldn't implement sexualized chat features, unlike rival models such as xAI's Grok. In an August interview, independent tech journalist Cleo Abram asked Altman to give an example of a decision he had made that was best for the world, but not for winning the AI race. \"Well, we haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet,\" Altman said in an apparent nod to provocative AI companions released by Elon Musk's xAI. Altman's policy shift comes at a notable time for OpenAI, as it already faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices. In September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over potential risks to children and teenagers.That followed a lawsuit from a California couple who alleged that ChatGPT contributed to their 16-year-old son's suicide.OpenAI on Tuesday also announced an eight-member expert council on well-being and AI to advise the company on how artificial intelligence affects users' mental health, emotions and motivation. The council will guide OpenAI in defining what healthy AI interactions look like through check-ins and recurring meetings, the company said.",

    "body": "Nscale, the UK-headquartered AI infrastructure provider.Courtesy: NscaleAI cloud company Nscale is eyeing an IPO, the company confirmed to CNBC Wednesday as it announced a $14-billion deal with U.S. tech giant Microsoft.The London-based company, which provides technology infrastructure to help AI scale, has \"public market ambitions\" which could be realized in the \"back end of next year,\" Chief Executive Josh Payne told the Financial Times on Wednesday.A company spokesperson declined to comment on where the company is considering listing.On Wednesday Nscale announced an \"expanded partnership\" with Microsoft, netting the younger company $14 billion, a figure first reported by the Financial Times and verified by CNBC.Microsoft will purchase around 200,000 NVIDIA GB300 GPUs from Nscale, inclusive of 75,000 GPUs for projects in Norway and the U.K. that were previously announced, putting the total deal worth at around $23 billion, according to CNBC calculations based on previous annoucements.A company spokesperson declined to comment on the value of the deals.watch nowIt comes less than a month after Nscale announced a $433 million funding around, which itself came hot on the heels of a $1.1 billion financing that is considered to be the largest Series B in Europe. Its investors include other technology heavyweights such as Dell, NVIDIA and Nokia, as well as asset manager Blue Owl Managed Funds.Founded in 2018, Nscale's pace of development speaks to the wider fervor around AI and the race to build out infrastructure that can support it. In both the public and private markets, fears of a bubble have emerged as investors pile-in on AI-related stocks and startups.Nscale, however, shows no signs of slowing down. \"We're always in touch with investors about future opportunities,\" a company spokesperson said.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump arrives at the White House, following his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 10, 2025. Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has vowed to target only \"Democrat Agencies\" for permanent staffing cuts amid the government shutdown — but the administration's layoffs so far have affected programs and services that cut across party lines.The White House on Friday issued thousands of reduction-in-force notices, known as RIFs.Around 4,200 federal employees from at least eight departments and agencies were affected.The department sustaining the largest cuts was the Treasury Department, where nearly 1,450 staffers received RIF notices.The RIFs there included cutting the entire 83-person staff of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which invests in public-private partnerships to support lower-income communities, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.The CDFI has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress. In March, after Trump signed an executive order targeting the fund for cuts, a group of 23 senators wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to reaffirm \"the critical role it plays in the communities it serves.\"The letter noted that every dollar provided to CDFI \"generates at least eight more dollars from private-sector investment.\" The signatories included a group of Republican senators: Mike Crapo of Idaho, Montana's Tim Sheehy, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mississippi's Cindy Hyde-Smith, and Jim Justice of West Virginia.In late July, a longer list of Republican and Democratic senators urged White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought to swiftly give CDFI the funding that Congress appropriated for it.CDFI employees who received RIF notices on Friday were told that their service would end Dec. 13, the Journal reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesThe second-largest number of RIFs was issued to employees at the Health and Human Services Department, where more than 1,300 employees were reportedly affected.But the terminations of about 700 staffers at DHS, who work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were reportedly reversed the next day.But other fired employees, including those from the CDC's Washington field office, its Injury Center and its Division of Violence Prevention, will not be rehired, The New York Times reported.At the Education Department, 466 employees received RIFs.Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, wrote on social media on Friday that the hundreds of Education Department impacting special education services, school grants and more.\"Special education oversight. Grants to high-need schools. Protection of civil rights. Gone,\" she Pringle wrote. \"This administration is destroying our education system from the inside out.\"The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, where some of the cuts reportedly took place, is among the offices targeted in Project 2025, the right-wing manual for a major government overhaul.Some Republican senators have spoken out against the firings by the Trump administration.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Friday that she \"strongly oppose[s]\" Vought's attempt to permanently lay off furloughed workers, even as she blamed the shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in an X post Friday, \"There is no question this is poorly timed and yet another example of this administration's punitive actions toward the federal workforce.\"\"The termination of federal employees in a shutdown will further hurt hard-working Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service and jeopardize agency missions once we finally re-open the government,\" she wrote.The Trump administration, which blames Democrats for the shutdown that hit Day 14 on Tuesday, has argued that the firings are an unavoidable consequence of the federal funding lapse, though that has not been the case in prior shutdowns.At the same time, Trump has touted the prospect of mass cuts as an \"unprecedented opportunity\" to eliminate parts of the government that his Republican Party dislikes.His administration has already made clear through its Department of Government Efficiency that slashing the federal bureaucracy is a major priority, though that group's cuts have fallen short of its initial goals.The president's latest firing threats are explicitly partisan.On the second day of the shutdown, Trump said he was considering cutting \"Democrat Agencies\" on either a temporary or permanent basis.During a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, he said, \"We're only cutting Democrat programs.\"Democrats will \"get a little taste of their own medicine,\" he added.What that meant was unclear, as federal agencies and programs are not divided by party. Trump, at the meeting, described them as \"very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly.\"",

    "body": "Travis Hutchison, a soybean farmer, unloads his cargo from his family's truck at a local grain dealer in Queen Anne, Maryland, on Oct. 10, 2025. Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.China is committing an \"Economically Hostile Act\" by \"purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.Ending business with China on cooking oil and \"other elements of Trade\" are possible forms of \"retribution\" that Trump said he was weighing.\"As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don't need to purchase it from China,\" he wrote.China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, importing some 27 million metric tons valued at nearly $12.8 billion in 2024 alone.But amid a simmering trade war with the Trump administration, Beijing has not bought a single American soybean since May.With retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods making soybeans pricier for Chinese importers, China has been sourcing the crop instead from producers in South America.One of those suppliers is Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes on the same day that the Trump administration first pledged to bolster the country's economy with a $20 billion currency swap.Argentina President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday, hours before the U.S. leader issued his latest salvo against China.Meanwhile, China's exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total.Trump's social media post follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.The S&P 500 stock index fell immediately after Trump's post, ending the trading day in the red after a volatile session.Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to massively increase tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals. Later that day, Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1.But on Sunday, Trump appeared to soften his attack, writing, \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\"Stocks broadly rebounded on Monday.",

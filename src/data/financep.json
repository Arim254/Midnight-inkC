    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Dec. 10, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. forces on Wednesday seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said. \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela — a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump said during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.The president declined to provide information on who owned the tanker or its destination, but said it was \"seized for a very good reason.\"The tanker has been identified as the Skipper, according to Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler.Skipper is a Guyana-flagged \"Very Large Crude Carrier,\" or VLCC, that was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November, Smith told CNBC.Smith said the ship appeared to be headed for Cuba, though it has been stopped offshore Venezuela since it was loaded.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Wednesday that a seizure warrant for the crude oil tanker was executed by the FBI, the Homeland Security Department's investigations unit and the U.S. Coast Guard, with support from the Pentagon.Bondi, in an X post, shared apparent military drone footage showing soldiers boarding the vessel from a helicopter.The tanker, which transported oil from Venezuela and Iran, has been sanctioned by the U.S. for years \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote on X.The seizure \"was conducted safely and securely,\" she added, \"and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.\"U.S. crude oil was up 70 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.95 per barrel at 3:12 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" Smith said. — CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on December 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated quarter percentage point interest rate cut at a meeting that was packed with intrigue and surprises. Here's a look at five top takeaways:The hawkish cut is real — kind of. Wall Street had been anticipating the Fed would deliver a strong dose of caution along with the cut, with a warning that the bar was high for additional easing. Markets, though, didn't seem to mind: Stocks posted solid gains on the day while Treasury yields fell.While a 9-3 vote might suggest broad support for the move, the Federal Open Market Committee is different. Three dissents is a lot, the most, in fact, since September 2019. And one of the \"no\" votes came from an unexpected source: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. Governor Stephen Miran wanted a half-point cut, while Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored holding steady. A total of six of the 19 participants at the meeting said they wouldn't have voted for the cut, giving voice to \"soft dissents\" who think the easing has gone far enough.The dots held. In short, the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate views were little changed for the coming years, with the median indicating just one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles around a neutral 3%. Markets largely took the committee at its word, though futures pricing late in the day pointed to a non-negligible 38% chance of two cuts next year.Bond buying is back. Well, not really bonds, but bills, which the Fed will start buying again come Friday. With overnight funding markets feeling pressure, the central bank said it will buy $40 billion of short-term bills as part of a monthly program aimed at stabilizing markets and keeping the fed funds rate within its quarter-point range. Buying levels will change, but some market participants viewed the announcement as a stealth easing that is positive for risk assets.Chair Jerome Powell was mostly upbeat about growth, and so was the committee. \"We have an extraordinary economy,\" said Powell, who has just three meetings left as chair. FOMC officials raised their view as well, boosting the outlook for 2026 gross domestic product growth by half a percentage point to 2.3%.What they're saying\"Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed Chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while. Still, continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25 bps cut into the mix for January.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a reported finalist to succeed Powell\"The Fed's guidance probably tells us less than usual about the interest rate outlook, for two big reasons. First, they know less than usual about the current state of the economy because the shutdown delayed the release of economic statistics. Second, the Fed's guidance doesn't account for how its approach will change after Chair Powell's term ends in May. In 2026, the Fed seems more likely to cut rates by more than signaled in the December Dot Plot than by less.\" — Bill Adams, chief economist, Comerica Bank\"The Fed lifted its expectations of growth next year which, along with the increase in cash to American households via changing tax policy, will create doubt about the path of monetary policy. This dynamic in our estimation substantially lifts the bar on any prospective rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in January.\" — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist, RSM",

    "body": "Henrique Braun to become the next CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.Courtesy: The Coca-Cola CompanyCoca-Cola Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun will succeed James Quincey as CEO next year, the company said Wednesday, as Coke and its rivals navigate tepid consumer demand for soft drinks.The change will take effect on March 31, and Braun will be nominated to the company's board of directors, Coca-Cola said. Quincey will stay on with the company as executive chairman of its board.Quincey, 60, has held the top job at the beverage giant since 2017. During that time, he oversaw the refranchising of Coke's bottling system, the company's strategy through the Covid pandemic and its focus on beverages perceived as healthier.Braun, 57, has held various roles at Coke since joining the company in 1996, the same year that Quincey joined. Braun became COO at the beginning of the year. In a release, Coca-Cola said Braun will focus on identifying new growth opportunities around the world, better filling consumer needs and improving the company's technology.James Quincey, Coca-Cola CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCThe leadership change comes as the beverage company tries to reverse slower demand for its sodas, which still account for a significant amount of its global sales. In Coke's third-quarter, global unit case volume — which strips out pricing and foreign currency changes — rose 1% after falling in the previous three-month period. Quincey has said lower-income consumers have bought fewer of its drinks, and the company has rolled out cheaper and smaller versions of its products to try to reverse the trend. However, pricier brands like Smartwater and Fairlife have performed better than its soda segment in recent quarters, suggesting that consumers are willing to pay more for some brands. Coca-Cola has also largely outperformed rival Pepsico during Quincey's tenure, in part due to its stronger out-of-home business in venues like restaurants and movie theaters. Coke is also winning the soda wars. Its namesake soda has held onto its spot as the best-selling soda in the U.S., and Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soda in the nation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCoke's stock has outperformed Pepsi's in recent years.Coke shares were largely unchanged in extended trading Wednesday. The company's stock has climbed nearly 13% this year, while Pepsi shares have fallen more than 1%.Coke's market cap of more than $300 billion outstrips that of Pepsi, which has a market value of roughly $200 billion.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump participates in a roundtable discussion with business leaders at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 10, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point could have been \"at least doubled.\"Trump, who has long urged the central bank to slash rates in order to spur further economic growth, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut.Trump, during a roundtable meeting with CEOs at the White House, also said he plans to interview former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh later Wednesday. Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett are two of the top contenders to succeed Powell when his term ends in May.\"I'm looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates,\" Trump said, before adding, \"Our rate should be much lower.\"Powell has been a major target of criticism from Trump, who believes the Fed has been too slow to lower rates during the first year of his second presidential term.Trump also lamented what he described as the tendency to raise interest rates in the wake of strong economic results.  \"We're going to go back to the old days,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"When we announced great results, it doesn't mean we're going to raise interest rates and try and kill it.\"The president's comments came shortly after the Fed announced the 25-basis-point cut, its third of the year. The decision was the middle-ground choice among a divided Fed: Two of the members preferred not to change rates, while Stephen Miran, a Trump administration economic official, favored a larger cut.Powell, at a news conference later Wednesday, said the latest cut was a \"close call\" that gives the Fed room to \"wait and see how the economy evolves.\"He also directly blamed Trump's tariffs for the nation's \"somewhat elevated\" inflation level. \"These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs,\" Powell said, citing the rise in two key inflation gauges.",

The council was created in 2010 as an outgrowth of efforts to prevent such a crisis from happening again.As Treasury secretary, Bessent chairs the council. The proposal coincides with an FSOC meeting slated for Thursday at which he delivers a letter updating where it stands on its work.The plan also lines up with the Trump administration's focus on deregulation, but represents a switch from the council's long-standing tilt toward stronger regulation. Along with the proposal, Bessent is forming a working group whose mission will be to \"explore opportunities for [artificial intelligence] to promote the resilience of the financial system while also monitoring for potential risks to financial stability that might be posed by the adoption of AI.\"Bessent will contend that lowering regulator barriers and oversight will strengthen the financial system and boost economic growth.",

Bansal's latest venture, Harness, is now worth substantially more than that, after raking in $200 million in fresh capital at a $5.5 billion valuation in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs.Harness' technology helps companies manage and monitor code that's produced with the help of artificial intelligence, making sure it doesn't break, create security vulnerabilities or trigger cost overruns. It's a compliment to the so-called vibe coding trend that's taken off with the boom in generative AI. In recent months, venture capitalists have poured money into startups such as Cursor, Lovable and most recently Kilo Code that sell subscriptions for tools for directing AI models to write and update software. Harness' software draws on models from Anthropic and OpenAI.Earlier this year, Bansal bolstered Harness' cybersecurity chops by merging the startup with Traceable, another company he co-founded. The combined company, based in San Francisco, has a total of about 1,300 employees.Harness is on track to exceed its goal of more than $250 million in annualized revenue, growing more than 50% year over year, Bansal said. That makes it larger than AppDynamics at the time it was acquired by Cisco. Bansal is aiming for a different outcome this time. \"I'm a believer that at the right market timing, we want to operate as a public company, so we can build for the long term,\" Bansal said. In addition to the funding round, Harness is also planning a $40 million tender offer to provide some liquidity to long-standing employees.WATCH: 'Vibe-coding's' evil twin?

    "body": "A home is shown for sale in The Heights in Houston, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesHome prices have finally come down compared with last year, though just fractionally, according to daily reads from Parcl Labs, which looks at high-frequency listing data on single-family homes, condos and townhomes, both new and existing. They may stay softer, though, as home prices are down 1.4% in just the last three months.On a national level, home prices have not gone negative since mid-2023, a year after the Federal Reserve first brought rates up from zero, and mortgage rates moved sharply higher. From March 2022 to June 2023, the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage went from 3.9% to just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily. But even then, prices were negative on a year-over-year basis for just a few months. It was nothing like the great financial crisis when home prices dropped 27% from their peak in 2006 to their trough in 2012, according to the S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. \"More recently we have seen a period of national softness emerging after the rapid run-up during the Covid years, 2020 to 2022,\" said Jason Lewris, co-founder of Parcl Labs. \"The sharp increase in mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023 created an affordability shock: buyers were priced out, sales volumes dropped, and sellers had to adjust expectations. Historically, that combination of a credit or affordability shock, weaker demand, and more inventory than the market can easily absorb is what tends to produce broad national price declines.\"Inventory today is still historically low, but it has come off its near-record lows of recent years. Active listings in November were nearly 13% higher than November 2024, but new listings were just 1.7% higher, according to Realtor.com. Sellers are also pulling their homes off the market at an unusually high rate. Prices nationally are down less than 1%, but certain markets are seeing more significant drops: Prices in Austin, Texas, are down 10% from last year; in Denver, they're down 5%, according to Parcl Labs. Tampa, Florida, and Houston both saw prices fall 4%, and Atlanta and Phoenix saw price decreases of 3%.There are also markets seeing gains: in Cleveland, prices gained 6%; Chicago and New York City both saw price increases of 5%; Philadelphia saw prices rise 3%; and Pittsburgh and Boston both saw 2% price gains, according to Parcl. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.While other home price indexes and surveys measure just existing home values, this one measures both new and existing. There has been no government data on housing starts, building permits or sales of newly built homes since before the government shutdown started, so it's difficult to paint any kind of supply picture in the price forecast. That said, builders reporting quarterly earnings have indicated that demand is still relatively weak and incentives are still necessary. Homebuilder sentiment is still well into negative territory.\"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said Robert Dietz, NAHB's chief economist, in a November release. \"After a decline for single-family housing starts in 2025, NAHB is forecasting a slight gain in 2026 as builders continue to report future sales conditions in marginally positive territory.\" Mortgage rates have not moved much in the last three months, and had very little reaction to the latest Federal Reserve rate cut Wednesday. Home prices, therefore, are unlikely to do much either. \"Our base case from here is not a deep national downturn, but a period where prices hover around zero, with small positive or small negative year over year changes, rather than the double digit gains of the pandemic era,\" said Lewris. \"How far they move in either direction will depend mainly on mortgage rates and the broader health of the economy.\" ",

    "body": "Celsopupo | Istock | Getty ImagesZealand Pharma on Thursday outlined an ambitious five-year strategy for its anti-obesity portfolio Thursday, spotlighting how growing competition from smaller players is tightening the race for market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as more of these medicines near market entry.The new strategy, \"Metabolic Frontier 2030,\" comes as Zealand shares have dropped 29% year to date as investors are betting the market will fragment, with fewer singular winners than they were 18 months ago at the peak of the weight loss drug frenzy.Ahead of its Capital Markets Day on Thursday, the Danish drugmaker said it now targets five drug launches, at least 10 clinical pipeline programs and industry-leading cycle times by 2030.The strategy will combine strategic partnerships, accelerated drug development, and expanded research capabilities to build the world's most valuable metabolic health pipeline, Zealand Pharma said in a statement. One of Zealand's most promising drugs under development is petrelintide which targets the pancreatic amylin hormone — different from the GLP-1 gut hormone targeted by Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound. The drug, developed in partnership with Roche, has shown more moderate side effects than current injectables in early-stage clinical trials. Mid-stage data on petrelintide are due early next year, while data on its dual GLP-1 agonist called survodutide will read out throughout 2026.Fewer standout winnersNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly currently dominate the market for weight loss drugs and have a head-start on their competition, having developed the only Food and Drug Administration approved anti-obesity drugs to date. But as the the market takes shape, more players are wanting in on the lucrative business which analysts predict could be worth as much as $150 billion annually by the start of next decade. While Novo Nordisk shares are having their worst year ever in 2025, down 50% year to date, Eli Lilly has become an investor-favorite as the Indiana-based company's Zepbound and Mounjaro has shown more pronounced weight loss than Novo's Ozempic and Wegovy. Lilly has also taken the lead on U.S. new prescriptions. On Thursday, Lilly released the first late-stage data on its next generation weight loss drug retatrutide. It works differently from existing injections and appears to be more effective as it targets three different appetite-regulating hormones, as opposed to one or two like Wegovy and Zepbound. Lilly's stock has held up better as investor see its pipeline as more likely to translate to financial returns, and the company also has a diverse porfolio that goes beyond diabetes and weight loss treatments.Meanwhile, Zealand shares, like Novo's peaked in mid-2024 but gains moderated as bets are also placed elsewhere. Only last month, it paused development of an GLP-1/GLP-2 dual agonist called dapiglutide, citing a crowded market for obesity drugs. Instead, Zealand indicated that it would focus resources to candidates with a greater potential for clinical differentiation.Big Pharma names like AstraZeneca, Amgen and Pfizer are all hoping that their own drug candidates will take a slice out of Lilly and Novo's market share, as are clinical-stage players like Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics.The market credits Lilly but undervalues innovation elsewhere, according to Morningstar's Karen Andersen. \"While we see Lilly holding more than 50% global share for the foreseeable future, we think its share will stabilize as Novo and other competitors launch next-generation drugs,\" she wrote in a November note. \"Consensus fails to appreciate these drugs' potential.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZealand Pharma shares have fallen by nearly a third in 2025Separately, Zealand announced an agreement with Chinese biotech firm OTR Therapeutics to develop oral small molecule treatments for metabolic diseases. Under the deal, OTR will receive $20 million up front, with an additional $10 million if certain conditions are met, as well as up to $2.5 billion related to development, regulatory and commercial milestones. UBS analysts called the partnership \"an interesting move.\"\"Ahead of a catalyst rich 2026 with P3 survodutide trial and P2 petrelintide readout due, we will look for expectations for these readouts, commercialisation strategy and any colour on potential pricing for survodutide, and how Zealand sees as potential differentiation for OTR's small molecule drugs versus other oral GLP-1s that are already close to market,\" the analysts said. Zealand also said it will open a new research site in Boston that combines its peptide drug expertise with AI‑driven drug discovery.",

    "body": "A Deere & Co. tractor in front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRepublican lawmakers are appealing to President Donald Trump for more farm relief and aid for agricultural equipment manufacturers amid his tariff blitz, even as the president has made a $12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by his trade policies. Farmers have said that Trump's tariff policies have hit their bottom lines, since they rely on exports to international trade competitors, including China, to stay afloat. That hit comes on top of several years of low commodity prices and high costs for key inputs like fertilizer, which were already forcing farmers to tighten their belts.The reduction in demand for new equipment from cash-strapped farmers led to layoffs earlier this year by some of the largest manufacturers, including Deere. Cory Reed, president of Deere's agriculture and turf division, told the Financial Times this week that the \"US market has been the one under the most pressure . . . based on what's happened with trade flows, what's happened with tariffs and what's happened with the escalating cost structure internally, as we've seen that market cycle down.\"Kip Eideberg, the head of government and industry relations at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, said, \"We remain concerned that persistent high tariffs, especially on critical parts and components that cannot be sourced domestically, will inadvertently harm our farmers and ranchers and drive up costs for all Americans.\"The dynamic has alarmed lawmakers, some of whom asked Trump to step in as he attempts to rescue farmers, a loyal voting bloc, from the financial fallout of his trade policies. A spokesperson for Trump-ally Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the senator has appealed to the administration. \"Last week, Senator Grassley raised constituent concerns to the White House, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture, sharing that equipment manufacturers could use targeted relief from the tariffs and urging the administration to remove tariffs on specific farm machinery parts,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.Other Republican senators have spoken up, too. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said in an interview that the equipment issue came up at a Monday roundtable at the White House where Trump laid out his relief plan for farmers injured by his trade policies. He said the president was receptive to pleas for aid to farmers for equipment. \"We talked specifically with the president about it, and he specifically said he wants to look at how he can help make farm equipment more affordable,\" Hoeven said. Hoeven said Trump suggested \"reducing some of the regulatory burdens on farm equipment manufacturers,\" to keep costs down. Trump at that roundtable publicly suggested he would slash environmental regulations on farm equipment manufacturers, but only if those companies reduce their prices. Those regulations do not \"do anything except it makes the equipment much more expensive and much more complicated to work, and it's not as good as the old days,\" Trump said. \"We're gonna do it and we're gonna say 'you're gonna reduce the prices.' \"But Republican lawmakers argue that the solution lies in getting farmers more income so they can purchase new equipment.That may be a tall order, given the already tight margins for operating a farm, and the impact from Trump's tariffs.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Frank Lucas, R-Okla., a former House Agriculture Committee Chair and a farmer himself, said the sagging market for manufacturers is indicative of a poor farm economy. \"When the equipment dealers start to scream, when the fertilizer and seed dealers start to scream, when the banks start to scream, there's a problem,\" Lucas said.\"I think the $12 billion aid package that the administration is talking about is a step in that direction, and I will also admit to you, we just need to wrap up some of these trade negotiations and get our products back into the world markets.\"   The Trump administration has been engaged in trade talks with various countries, and in some cases have lowered tariffs as a result.Trump's $12 billion trade bailout, dubbed the Farmer Bridge Payment Program, carves out $11 billion for row crop farmers who grow massive quantities of crops like corn and soybeans. Farmers this year already were getting roughly $30 billion in supplemental aid from the federal government Additional federal funds will flow next October, when provisions from the Republican reconciliation package known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act kick in. But American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall warned that farmers will need more than that to get by. \"Bridge support is a down payment, and members in Congress have already expressed their desire to fill in the gaps,\" Duvall wrote on the group's website. Some members of Congress agreed, signaling a likely additional influx of federal funds into agriculture down the road. Senate Agriculture Chair John Boozman, R-Ark., said farmers are in their third year in a row where \"if they're growing something in the ground, they're losing money.\" \"We're prepared to do more in Congress if we need to do it,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowA  Federal Reserve split over where its priorities should lie cut its key interest rate Wednesday, but signaled a tougher road ahead for further reductions.Fulfilling expectations of a \"hawkish cut,\" the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee lowered its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, putting it in a range between 3.5%-3.75%.However, the move carried caution flags about where policy is headed from here and featured \"no\" votes from three members, which hasn't happened since September 2019.The 9-3 vote again featured hawkish and dovish dissents – Governor Stephen Miran favored a steeper half-point reduction while regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Austan Goolsbee of Chicago backed holding the line. In Fed parlance, hawks are generally more concerned about inflation and favor higher rates while doves focus on supporting the labor market and want lower rates.This was the third consecutive \"no\" vote from Miran, who leaves the Fed in January, and the second straight from Schmid. The previous three-dissent meeting also featured a 2-1 divide from members conflicted between the need for tighter and looser monetary policy.The post-meeting rate statement repurposed language from the FOMC meeting a year ago.\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" the statement said.When the language was used in December 2024, it signaled that the committee likely was done cutting for the time being. The FOMC then did not approve any reductions until the September 2025 meeting.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at his post-meeting news conference, said the reduction puts the Fed in a comfortable position as far as rates go.\"We are well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,\" Powell said. Stocks rose following the decision, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 500 points. Treasury yields moved mostly lower.\"We're in the high end of the range of neutral,\" Powell added. \"It's so happened that we've cut three times. We have we haven't made any decision about January, but as I said, we think we're well positioned to wait and see how the economy performs.\"With a third consecutive cut now made, the focus turns to where the FOMC heads from here.The closely watched \"dot plot\" of individual officials' expectations on rates indicated just one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 before the federal funds rate hits a longer-run target around 3%. Those projections were unchanged from the September update, but the plot reflected divisions within the committee about where rates should head.Along with the two \"no\" dovish votes on the rate cut, four other nonvoting meeting participants registered \"soft dissents\" indicating that they did not go along with the decision. Seven officials also indicated they want no cuts next year. FOMC meetings feature 19 participants among the governors and regional presidents, 12 of whom vote.\"The discussions we have are as good as any we've had in my 14 years at the Fed, very thoughtful, respectful, and you just have people who have strong views, and we come together and we reach a place where we can make a decision,\" Powell said.On the economy, the committee raised its collective view of gross domestic product growth for 2026, boosting its September projection up by half a percentage point, to 2.3%. The committee continues to expect inflation to hold above its 2% target until 2028.On inflation, prices remain stubbornly high, with the Fed's preferred gauge putting the annual rate at 2.8% in September, the most recent month for which data is available. While that's considerably off the peaks of a few years ago, it's still well north of the central bank's 2% target.In addition to the rate decision, the Fed also announced it will resume buying Treasury securities, following up on an announcement at the October meeting that it would halt its balance sheet runoff this month. The move comes amid concerns about pressures in overnight funding markets.The central bank will start by buying $40 billion in Treasury bills, beginning Friday. From there, purchases are expected to \"remain elevated for a few months\" and then likely will be \"significantly reduced.\"The moves come at a sensitive time for the Fed.As he seeks to maintain consensus among policymakers, Powell is nearing the end of his second term as chair. He has just three meetings left before he makes way for President Donald Trump's nominee.Trump has signaled he will litmus test his choice, using a preference for lower rates as a barometer, rather than someone committed to the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment. The president told reporters Tuesday evening he expects to make a choice soon.Predictions markets are betting the nominee will be National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who is viewed in some corners of the financial markets as a Fed chair who will seek to do Trump's bidding. As of Wednesday morning, Kalshi had Hassett's chances of getting the nod at 72%, with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and current Governor Christopher Waller trailing far behind.Fed officials have had to operate in an environment where much of the official data they use in decision-making either has been trickling in well behind schedule or missing entirely, due to the government shutdown that lasted about six weeks, until Nov. 12.What data they have seen has indicated a low-hire, low-fire labor market, with employers reluctant both to add to payrolls or to lay off large numbers of workers. However, recent signs from unofficial data point to heavier jobs reductions to come, with announced layoffs through November topping 1.1 million, according to employment placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Correction: Kevin Hassett is director of the National Economic Council. An earlier version misstated his title.",

    "body": "watch nowOracle shares plummeted 15% Thursday, after the firm reported disappointing results.The cloud computing and database software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Wednesday, despite booming demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. Its revenue came in at $16.06 billion, compared with $16.21 billion expected by analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.It dragged other AI-related names down with it. Chip darling Nvidia fell more than 2%, memory and storage firm Micron was 1% lower, cloud company Coreweave slid 5% and AMD was 3% lower. Oracle has been the subject of much market chatter since raising $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, marking one of the largest debt issuances for the tech industry on record. The name shot onto investor agendas when it inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI in the same month. Oracle made further moves into cloud infrastructure, where it battles Big Tech names such as Amazon,  Microsoft and Google for AI contracts.However, investors have questioned Oracle's aggressive AI infrastructure build-out plans and whether it needs such a colossal amount of debt to execute, though other tech firms have also recently issued corporate bonds.

The firm will raise roughly $20 billion to $30 billion in debt every year for the next three years, according to estimates by Citi analyst Tyler Radke.On the company's earnings call, Principal Financial Officer Doug Kehring committed to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating. \"In addition, there are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,\" he said. \"Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.\"Oracle expects about $50 billion in full-year capital expenditures, up from $35 billion as of September, with the new commitments, Kehring said. The sum for fiscal 2025 was $21.2 billion.Its free cash flow — the metric investors are watching closely as they navigate AI bubble concerns, as it shows a company's ability to pay its debt —  for the November quarter was negative by about $10 billion. The StreetAccount consensus was negative $5.2 billion.While this is \"naturally a focus point of investors,\" Wedbush Securities analysts said that it's \"a high class problem that Oracle is dealing with on the AI demand front.\"\"Overall, Oracle's core AI and cloud numbers and backlog tell a very healthy and robust AI Revolution demand story for the sector....any sell-off today on the sector we view as a clear buying opportunity given the underlying demand story that was further validated by Oracle last night.\"Oracle's share price has moved 34% higher year-to-date despite recent losses. — CNBC's Seema Mody and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Walt Disney Co. on Thursday announced it will make a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI and will allow users to make videos with its copyrighted characters on its Sora app.OpenAI launched Sora in September, and it allows users to create short videos by simply typing in a prompt. As part of the startup's new three-year licensing agreement with Disney, Sora users will be able make content with more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars starting next year. \"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works,\" Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement.As part of the agreement, Disney said it will receive warrants to purchase additional equity and will become a major OpenAI customer. Disney is deploying OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, to its employees and will work with its technology to build new tools and experiences, according to a release. When Sora launched this fall, the app rocketed to the top of Apple's App Store and generated a storm of controversy as users flooded the platform with videos of popular brands and characters. The Motion Picture Association said in October that OpenAI needed to take \"immediate and decisive action\" to prevent copyright infringement on Sora. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said more \"granular control\" over character generation was coming, according to a blog post following the launch.As AI startups have rapidly changed the way that people can interact with content online, media companies, including Disney, have kicked off a series of fresh legal battles to try and protect their intellectual property.Disney sent a cease and desist letter to Google late on Wednesday alleging the company infringed its copyrights on a \"massive scale.\" In the letter, which was viewed by CNBC, Disney said Google has been using its copyrighted works to train models and distributing copies of its protected content without authorization.Universal and Disney have sued the AI image creator Midjourney, alleging that the company improperly used and distributed AI-generated characters from their movies. Disney also sent a cease and desist letter to Character.AI in September, warning the startup to stop using its copyrighted characters without authorization.Disney's deal with OpenAI suggests the company isn't ruling out AI platforms entirely.Read more CNBC tech newsOracle shares plummet, dragging down AI stocksOver $50 billion in under 24 hours: Why Big Tech is doubling down on investing in IndiaCisco's stock closes at record for first time since dot-com peak in 2000Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats upThe companies said they have affirmed a commitment to the use of AI that \"protects user safety and the rights of creators\" and \"respects the creative industries,\" according to the release. OpenAI has also agreed to maintain \"robust controls\" to prevent illegal or harmful content from being generated on its platforms. Some of the characters available through the deal include Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Cinderella, Iron Man and Darth Vader. Disney and OpenAI said the agreement does not include any talent likeness or voices. Users will also be able to draw from the same intellectual property while using ChatGPT Images, where they can use natural language prompts to create images. \"Disney is the global gold standard for storytelling, and we're excited to partner to allow Sora and ChatGPT Images to expand the way people create and experience great content,\" Altman said in a statement.Curated selections of Sora videos will also be available to watch on Disney's streaming platform Disney+.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

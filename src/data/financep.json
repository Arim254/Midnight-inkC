    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Despite a brief pandemic-induced recession, higher inflation and rising borrowing costs since 2020, the wealthy have gotten considerably wealthier.The threshold to be in the top 10% of U.S. households by net worth grew from about $1.3 million to roughly $1.8 million over the last five years, largely due to rising stock and home values, according to a recent Visa analysis of 2024 U.S. Census Bureau survey data. That figure reflects the value of what households own — homes, vehicles, savings, retirement accounts, investments and other assets — minus any debts.In absolute terms, households already in the top 10% by net worth saw their wealth grow more than any other cohort over the last five years, according to the Federal Reserve's distribution of wealth data.The income needed to be in the top 10% also increased, climbing from about $170,000 to roughly $210,000 over the same period, Visa's analysis shows. For comparison, the U.S. median income is $83,730 as of 2024, per U.S Census Bureau data.Visa defines \"affluent\" households as those who either earn at least $210,000 or have a net worth of about $1.8 million, a level that places them above 90% of U.S. households.About 12.2 million U.S. households qualify under that definition, and Gen X makes up 57% of them, compared with 12% for boomers, the analysis shows. Millennials and Gen Z together account for the remaining 31%.It may not be surprising that Gen X leads the affluent group, given they're in their peak earning years, while many boomers are retired.Most wealth gains came from rising home and stock valuesThe last five years were unusually good for households that already owned a home or had money in the market. Even through the Covid-19 pandemic and a spike in inflation, the job market stayed strong and consumers kept spending, which kept the economy on solid footing.Home prices surged beginning in 2020 on tight supply and cheaper mortgage rates, which stayed near historic lows until the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in 2022, the first increase since December 2018.Major stock indexes also rebounded quickly from the early 2020 crash and went on to hit new highs, buoyed by a massive federal stimulus and a fast economic recovery, as measured by gross domestic product.Those trends pushed wealth up much faster than incomes. Paychecks rose, but at roughly half the pace. Between 2020 and 2024, the threshold for the top 10% of net worth grew about 40%, compared with about 23% for income, according to Visa's analysis.Broader indicators tell the same story: the U.S. median home price rose about 25% over the last five years, per U.S. Census data, and the S&P 500 gained roughly 109%.

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:1. Self-regulate before you reconnectBefore your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.2. Lead with connection, not correctionBefore asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: \"You matter more than the morning rush.\"This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.3. Create pockets of calm amid chaosIntegrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.4. Find moments for laughterEven in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.5. Check in emotionally, not just logisticallyBefore diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: \"How's your heart this morning?\" or \"What's one thing you're looking forward to today?\"These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.6. Make physical touch non-negotiableA morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.7. Create a screen-free sanctuaryMake mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 8. Honor the power of slownessChildren live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child’s natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.9. Create a bridge before goodbyeInstead of rushing out with a quick \"Let's go,\" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.Then add a \"connection bridge,\" or something to look forward to later: \"I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,\" or \"Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.\"Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of FOUNDATIONS, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

These groups are expected to grow by 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively.One of the main reasons that the health-care industry is expected to grow so rapidly is because the American population is aging, according to Emily Krutsch, branch chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\"That's really what's driving that trend: the older population tends to need more of this type of care and services,\" she says.Computer and mathematical roles will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology, according to Krutsch.\"We are expecting a boost in employment growth for occupations that would be involved in developing and testing and implementing these types of tools,\" Krutsch says.Relatedly, information security analyst roles are projected to grow significantly due to the \"larger need to protect data and develop systems and tools to secure it,\" she says.Krutsch emphasizes that the growth rate for each job isn't the only important data point to consider.For example, wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are the two fastest-growing jobs, but both occupations combined will add under 20,000 jobs by 2034. \"Just because we're talking about fast growth doesn't necessarily translate to lots of jobs, because it could just be a very, very small occupation,\" Krutsch says.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, these are the fastest-growing occupations for 2034, as well as the expected increase in jobs by 2034 and the current median salary for each role.1.

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"watch nowLegge said a 50% tax would likely lead to tax revenue falling. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse has called talk of an inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion\"\"We are dependent on good tax payers to finance our state,\" it warned.Legge said Switzerland faced competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, but added Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowWhen asked whether wealthy clients were scared, Giorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, told CNBC on Tuesday, \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management. We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. If successful, money raised from the tax would fund policies to combat climate change.",

    "body": "Strathroy | Istock | Getty ImagesFor nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left.Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world.\"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\"Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. 'A gut punch'As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year.Craftsman working with compressed air at tombstone.Kzenon | Istock | Getty ImagesDioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad.\"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\"Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs.In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%.He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result.\"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\"In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect.Milano's showroom and a memorial made by the business.Courtesy: Jim MilanoBecause the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S.\"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades.Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices.Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term.blank stone gravestones and grave slabs in outdoor rural granite workshop.Krimkate | Istock | Getty ImagesBut memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers.\"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\"A changing businessEven before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials.The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029.Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one.He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets.\"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments.

Social media users find concerning economic omens in places you wouldn't expectIf monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits.To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand.Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry members say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment.\"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\"",

Sergio Yate | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines said Saturday that aircrafts impacted by an Airbus recall have received the software fixes necessary to resume flying.\"As of 12 p.m. CT, no aircraft were left to be updated of the 209 impacted,\" the company said. \"American expects no further operational impact related to the Emergency Airworthiness Directive and looks forward to the remaining days of the Thanksgiving holiday travel period, especially Sunday, our most-traveled day.\"Thousands of travelers worldwide were stranded after Airbus ordered immediate software fixes for 6,000 A320-series aircraft, a move that affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected \"minor disruption to a few flights.\"  Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected.Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

    "body": "Silver, often nicknamed the 'Devil's metal' because of its volatility, has reached record highs this year and still has further to run despite a supply crunch, according to experts.The metal's growth value has been running alongside gold's, which has seen its own rally with the price surging past $4,000 an ounce this year.Silver prices reached a historic peak of $54.47 per troy ounce in mid October, marking a 71% rise year-on-year. They've since pared back gains somewhat, but are now growing again, despite low supply levels.\"Some people were having to transport silver by plane rather than on cargo ships to meet delivery demand,\" Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF Fixed Income and commodity product management at Invesco, told CNBC.\"While we've seen the spike up, we've seen the price come down a little bit. Longer term, there's a different dynamic this time that could keep silver at reasonably high prices and maybe continuing to go up for some time to come,\" he added.October was only the third time in the past 50 years where silver prices peaked. Other silver price highs include January 1980, when the Hunt brothers amassed a third of the world's supply as they attempted to corner the market, as well as 2011, following the U.S. debt ceiling crisis when silver and gold were embraced as safe haven assets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices year-to-date\"Silver is only about a tenth the size of the gold market, and that short squeeze, obviously, sort of caught a few investors by surprise,\" said Syms.Unlike the previous investment waves, silver's boom in 2025 relied on a mix of low supply and high demand from India as well as industrial needs and tariffs.\"After Liberation Day, the gold price spiked, but silver actually went down a little bit. And the gold-silver ratio spiked to above 100,\" said Syms, referring to the gold-silver ratio which reflects how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold.A low ratio means gold is relatively cheap, while a high ratio indicates silver is undervalued and likely to rise. In April, the ratio reached a historic high.\"The risk managers in financial and industrial entities did not want to let any metal go out of the States for fear that it might come back in at 35% higher for example,\" said Rhona O'Connell, head of market analysis EMEA and Asia at Stone X.watch nowFast forward to the Autumn and silver entered its peak demand, especially as India's monsoon and harvest seasons came to an end.\"Farmers don't really like the banks very much, so gold and latterly, silver, tend to be the first port of call when they've got the harvest in,\" said O'Connell.India is also the world's largest consumer of silver, with about 4,000 metric tons used every year, mostly for jewelry, utensils and ornaments. The silver appeal this Autumn also coincided with Diwali, a five-day 'Festival of Lights' celebrating prosperity and good fortune and also India's biggest public holiday.Supply crunchWhile gold is traditionally a favorite, this year silver — an affordable investment option in a country where about 55% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood — outshined other metals.On Oct. 17, the price of silver in India rose sharply, reaching a record high of 170,415 rupees a kilogram — an 85% rise since the start of the year.However, 80% of India's silver supply is imported. The UAE and China are increasingly supporting that demand, but the U.K. is traditionally India's largest silver supplier.Yet, London's vaults have been emptying rapidly for the past few years. In June 2022, the London Bullion Market Association held 31,023 metric tons of silver. By March  2025, volumes had fallen by around a third to 22,126 metric tons — its lowest point in years.\"What isn't necessarily so visible to people is what's happening in the vaults,\" said O'Connell. \"And that had reached a point where there was basically there was no available metal left in London.\"In October, the squeeze was such that traders had to pay much higher borrowing costs – or lease rates – to close their positions.\"At one stage, to borrow overnight was costing 200% on an annualized basis, so a lot of people were very stressed to put it mildly,\" said O'Connell.Supply is a constant issue for silver, as for other precious and rare metals. The Silver Institute's 2025's World Silver Survey estimates that mine production has been decreasing over the past 10 years, especially in Central and South America.\"Over the course of the past twelve months or so, the underlying surplus has started to turn into a deficit for three reasons: the impact of the electrification of the vehicle fleet, artificial intelligence, and photovoltaics,\" said O'Connell.Read more\"At the moment, a standard electric vehicle has about 25 grams of silver, maybe the larger EVs have 50 grams of silver as part of their components,\" said Syms.\"If we move into these solid-state silver batteries, each electric vehicle might require a kilo or more of silver,\" he added.And with silver having a high thermal conductivity and a higher electrical conductivity than other metals, as well as increasing demand for EVs, AI and renewables, the metal's value is likely to keep shining.\"Silver crosses over that bridge between precious and industrial metals, and the way technology is going on, the batteries, the solar panels, it's got some great use cases as we move into a more electrified world,\" said Syms.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNovember has been quite volatile, with the high valuations of artificial intelligence stocks and expectations of an interest rate cut in December impacting investor sentiment. Those seeking stable income in this uncertain backdrop can consider strengthening their portfolios by adding some dividend paying stocks.Given the vast universe of dividend stocks, selecting the attractive ones could be challenging. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help in decision-making, as their selection is based on in-depth analysis and thorough research.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MPLXMPLX (MPLX) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and offers fuel distribution services. The company announced a third-quarter distribution of $1.0765 per common unit, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year growth. At an annualized distribution of $4.31 per unit, MPLX offers a yield of 8.03%.In a recent research report, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on MPLX stock and raised the price target to $60 from $58. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MPLX stock with a price target of $59.\"We continue to view MPLX as one of the most compelling income plays among large-cap MLPs with an attractive current yield of ~8% and plans to grow further,\" said Scotto.The top-rated analyst expects MPLX to deliver higher EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from 2025 to 2026 compared to the prior year, driven by the scale-up of key projects like the Secretariat processing plant, the Titan sour gas treatment expansion, and the BANGL pipeline system.Additionally, Scotto is optimistic about MPLX delivering mid-single-digit EBITDA growth beyond 2026, driven by contributions from the Eiger pipeline and its Gulf Coast fractionation and export facilities, along with potential mergers and acquisitions. While Scotto slightly reduced her 2025 and 2026 adjusted EBITDA estimates following the Q3 results, she continues to expect MPLX to achieve its mid-single-digit annual growth target.Meanwhile, Scotto maintained her distribution per unit estimates and expects a 12.5% rise in 2026, followed by an incremental 12.5% hike in 2027, in line with the company's distribution growth target.Scotto ranks No. 333 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%.ConocoPhillipsAnother dividend-paying energy stock in this week's list is ConocoPhillips (COP). Earlier this month, the oil and gas exploration and production company announced an 8% hike in its fourth-quarter dividend to $0.84 per share, payable on December 1. COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3.65%. Following meetings with ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on COP stock with a price target of $115. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on ConocoPhillips stock and has assigned an \"outperform\" rating with a price target of $96.\"In terms of resource depth and diversity, we see COP as better positioned than any company in our coverage universe,\" said Todd. He highlighted that ConocoPhillips has an industry-leading 22 years of drilling inventory, along with strong growth from LNG and U.S. conventional projects over the next four years. Todd contends that the market may still be underestimating COP's growth prospects beyond 2030, with massive growth potential across U.S. L48, Alaska, Norway, and Surmont and Montney in Canada.Todd is also impressed with ConocoPhillips' cost reduction efforts. He highlighted that COP has reduced adjusted operating costs by 8% or $900 million since 2024, with the 2026 outlook indicating another $400 million in cost reductions.Also, high-quality assets and lower costs are driving peer-leading free cash flow (FCF) growth for COP through 2030, with FCF/share estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2025 to 2030 at $70/bbl Brent, higher than the peer average of 8%. While investors worry that most growth comes after the contribution from the Willow project starts in 2029, Todd contends that near-term catalysts are likely underestimated. Todd estimates pre-Willow FCF/share to grow by 6% per year from 2025 to 2028, which still makes COP rank third among peers.Todd ranks No. 716 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.4%. International Business MachinesFinally, we look at tech giant IBM (IBM), which returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter via dividends. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.22%.Following a meeting with the management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on IBM stock with a price target of $315. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $349.Among the key takeaways, Daryanani highlighted that despite the uncertainties related to tariffs, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitics, management is optimistic about the broader macro backdrop and expects tech spending to be 2 to 3 points ahead of GDP growth. Over the medium term, IBM expects to sustain mid-single digit annual growth in its top line, driven by about 10% growth in the software business, better than-market growth in Consulting, and 1% to 3% increase in the Infrastructure segment revenue.The top-rated analyst also noted IBM's business transformation over the past five years, including the Red Hat acquisition and divestiture of GTS and other non-core assets. This transformation has helped IBM grow consistently with solid free cash flow and expansion in pre-tax income margin.Furthermore, Daryanani also discussed management's optimism about enterprise AI and a massive opportunity in the quantum space. \"We see multiple vectors for growth over the medium term,\" concluded Daryanani.Daryanani ranks No. 187 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.5%.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

He never stopped learning.\"He also never stopped looking for new investments, leafing through data on publicly traded companies in green Value Line binders.He went against conventional wisdom in 2023 by investing in two companies involved with coal, which he believed would still be needed due to rising demand for energy, despite environmental concerns.Borthwick tells The Journal, \"He read an article that said coal was down the chute. He said, 'Horse feathers.'\"Friends say he had paper gains of more than $50 million on coal miner Consol Energy and Alpha Metallurgical Resources, which provides coal for steel production.(Consol completed a merger with Arch Resources early this year to form Core Natural Resources.)Coal is excavated.Jim Urquhart | Reuters Munger also invested in real estate with an unusual partner.In 2005, Munger started mentoring a 17-year-old neighbor whose ADHD was contributing to his difficulties in school.Avi Mayer, now 37, tells the WSJ, \"He listened to my problems and talked about life principles and personal values.\"\"I watched him in action and learned from him, and he handed me books once in a while.\"Later, Munger backed a real estate company Mayer and a childhood friend established that has become one of the largest owners of low-rise \"garden\" apartments in California with around $3 billion in holdings.Munger \"remained involved until the end,\" helping to negotiate a building purchase that closed days after he died.The Journal says that as Munger grew older, he spent more time with friends, including a regular Tuesday morning country club breakfast with business associates that could go on for hours.He became less \"cranky and acerbic,\" telling the group, \"At my age, you make new friends, or you don't have any friends.\"And after many years, Munger's family gave up on trying to keep him on a healthy diet.The wife of his grandson reports Munger's last food delivery was a whole Korean fired chicken, kimchi fried rice, and waffle fries.A friend relates that even as Munger joked that he longed to be \"86 again,\" he remained optimistic about Berkshire's future.\"Once it's built, you don't need to be Warren and Charlie.

(Laughter)In your career of thousands of negotiations and business dealings, could you describe for the crowd which one sticks out in your mind as your favorite or is otherwise noteworthy?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, I don't think I've got a favorite. But the one that probably did us the most good as a learning experience was See's Candy.It's just the power of the brand, the unending flow of ever-increasing money with no work. (Laughter)AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sounds nice. (Laughter)CHARLIE MUNGER: It was. And I'm not sure we would have bought the Coca-Cola if we hadn't bought the See's.I think that a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time. And I think Berkshire's gained enormously from these investment decisions by learning through a long, long period.Every time you appoint a new person that's never had big capital allocation experience, it's like rolling the dice. And I think we're way better off having done it so long. And —But the decisions blend, and the one feature that comes through is the continuous learning. If we had not kept learning, you wouldn't even be here.You'd be alive probably, but not here. (Laughter)WARREN BUFFETT: There's nothing like the pain of being in a lousy business — (laughs) — to make you appreciate a good one.CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, there's nothing like getting into a really good one. That's a very pleasant experience and it's a learning experience.I have a friend who says, \"The first rule of fishing is to fish where the fish are.

Warehouse tenants are now more focused on efficiency, power and location than they are on square footage. New development has slowed down, and federal policies are pushing onshoring of manufacturing, which helps the sector counter still-high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Rent increases are no longer as steep as they were a few years ago, and in some markets they are actually falling slightly due to oversupply.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Industrial property rents are showing signs of stabilization, indicating a more balanced market environment,\" said Judy Guarino, managing director of commercial mortgage lending at JPMorgan Chase, in a note to investors.Here's what to watch for in warehouses in 2026. Big-boxThe big-box subsector refers to large, modern distribution and warehouse facilities that serve as hubs for logistics, storage and e-commerce fulfillment. It makes up about a quarter of the total industrial warehouse space in the U.S. Vacancies are close to cyclical peaks and new construction is contracting, according to industry data. In the first half of this year, new supply still outpaced new demand, but the gap shrank, according to new research from Colliers. Third-party logistics firms, including delivery services such as Ryder and DHL moving goods on behalf of a client, are leading that demand.\"The third-quarter demand has far exceeded the entire first half of the year, which is another really strong indicator that the supply and demand is starting to get more into a balanced state,\" said Stephanie Rodriguez, national director of industrial services at Colliers. Across the 20 largest markets, the overall big-box vacancy rate rose 19 basis points to 11% during the first half of the year, according to Colliers. New supply totaled 48 million square feet in the first half of 2025, much less than the 330 million square feet completed at the height of the cycle in 2023. Rents are expected to stabilize in the near term before starting to grow again. Big-box is a major segment of the overall warehouse real estate market, particularly driven by demand from online retailers and companies seeking efficient supply chain operations. Recent economic and tariff policies have definitely shaken that demand, but as those policies settle, more demand could return. Lower interest rates would be another driver. Supply chainSupply chain, which relies heavily on warehouse real estate, is also seeing something of a transformation that could increase demand. In a report titled \"Bold Predictions for 2026,\" Prologis, the world's largest logistics real estate company, cited specific supply chain trends to watch, including forecasts that:E-commerce companies will make up nearly 25% of new leasing next year as the proportion of goods sold online rises to almost 20% globally by year-end.The need for power-ready logistics facilities capable of supporting automation and manufacturing will be a top-three factor globally in location selection.Defense-related demand in the U.S. and Europe will breathe new life into older industrial corridors and produce a new class of specialized logistics assets.Shrinking trucking capacity will drive double-digit rate hikes in 2026, making transportation an even larger share of total supply chain spend and amplifying the value of well-located logistics real estate.PowerPower is emerging as a leading driver across real estate portfolios. Beyond the usual narrative of e-commerce and the data center sector, power availability and network densification are becoming important pricing catalysts, according to a recent report from Hines, a global real estate investment manager.\"While re/near-shoring demand continues to pick up speed, albeit slowly and with somewhat uneven impact, opportunity also lies in power-advantaged infill assets that support faster and denser networks; where distance once drove advantage, closeness now creates it,\" according to the Hines report. ReshoringFurther research from Hines shows that warehouse net absorption has correlated to manufacturing construction spend. \"This trend highlights another potential source of demand not only for industrial manufacturing facilities, but for the warehouse subsector as well,\" according to its report, which predicts reshoring alone could increase overall warehouse demand over the next five years by roughly 35%.\"Despite the volatility in the macroeconomic landscape, driven by interest rate and trade policy uncertainties, industrial properties near ports remain vital,\" Guarino said. \"Tariffs may lead to higher costs and supply chain challenges, but these locations are key to maintaining supply chain resilience and adapting to trade shifts.\"ProximityOne example of the proximity advantage: Amazon. Its logistics real estate strategy mirrors a broader national trend, prioritizing efficiency, automation and consumer proximity over sheer scale, according to a note from CoStar.\"It's an interesting inflection point for industrial developers and REITs that rode the pandemic-era boom,\" wrote Juan Arias, CoStar Group's national director of industrial analytics. Arias highlighted a leasing slowdown, noting that this year Amazon has occupied just 61 logistics properties, down from 100 in 2024 and as many as 300 in recent years. Its demand for larger footprint facilities hit a seven-year low, but it is still drawn to newer, taller buildings, with an emphasis on modern, efficient distribution centers, Arias said.AIAs with everything else, artificial intelligence and property technology are making an imprint on the warehouse sector as well. They are helping owners and operators to analyze supply chains, traffic patterns and data more efficiently — particularly important in identifying potential warehouse locations. They are also helping to manage inventory and predict maintenance needs, both of which reduce costs. ",

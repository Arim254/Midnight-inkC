    "body": "Global betwork concept using maps from NASA. Fotograzia | Moment | Getty ImagesAs competition with China intensifies, Washington is turning to a cornerstone of American soft power and diplomacy to expand its global influence in artificial intelligence: the Peace Corps. The White House on Friday announced the \"Tech Corps\" initiative within the Peace Corps aimed at promoting American AI abroad and helping partner nations adopt cutting-edge systems.The Peace Corps is an independent U.S. government agency that sends American volunteers abroad to support local development projects, including in education, health, agriculture and economic growth.The new Tech Corps will be structured similarly but will recruit, train, and deploy volunteers with tech skills, including engineers and graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to provide \"last-mile\" support for the implementation of American AI solutions abroad, particularly at the application layer.A website for the Tech Corps has launched and is accepting applications, which it says will be accepted on a rolling basis. In an announcement, the Peace Corps said that the AI solutions the new group implements would be put towards \"real-world grassroots problems\" in key sectors, including agriculture, education, health, and economic development.Volunteers would be sent to countries participating in the American AI Exports Program, announced in July under a Trump administration executive order aimed at maintaining U.S. dominance in advanced technologies globally. The executive order aligns with broader U.S. efforts to counter the influence of Chinese technologies globally, including in developing nations.Chinese firms have gained traction in some developing nations by offering open-source or open-weight models that are inexpensive, highly customizable, and able to run on local infrastructure — including Qwen3 and Deepseek.AI sovereigntyWhile a full list of countries taking part in the AI Exports Program remains unclear, India is expected to be among them, with the Commerce Department welcoming its participation last week.  That statement had come ahead of the inaugural India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, where Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, first announced the Tech Corps. India is also joining the U.S.-led Pax Silica initiative — a Trump administration effort aimed at securing the global supply chain for silicon-based technologies —  alongside Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, Israel, the United Kingdom, Australia, Qatar and the UAE as core members.At the summit, Kratsios argued that expanding access to U.S. AI technologies was central to closing the gap in global AI adoption between developed and developing economies. \"Real AI sovereignty means owning and using best-in-class technology for the benefit of your people,\" he said. AI sovereignty — which was a major topic at the Indian AI conference — refers to a country's ability to develop, control and govern artificial intelligence systems within its own legal, economic and strategic framework.The summit saw a number of American tech companies announce major investments in India's AI infrastructure, building on the billions announced last year, aligning with the goals of the Tech Corps. \"AI is the future, and as the undisputed world leader in AI technology, the United States, through the Tech Corps, will be at the forefront of delivering these benefits,\" said Richard E. Swarttz, acting Peace Corps director.Tech Corps volunteers will serve abroad for 12 to 27 months or participate in virtual service placements, with on-ground deployments expected to begin in fall 2026. As with the Peace Corps, volunteers will receive housing, healthcare, a living stipend, and service awards upon completion.In addition to the Tech Corps, the White House also announced other initiatives during the India AI summit, including a National Champions Initiative to integrate leading foreign AI companies into customized American AI export stacks. \"We recognize that partners need the chance to build their native technology industries, and believe facilitating this will be a critical part of the exports program,\" the White House said. It also announced new initiatives to help partner countries \"overcome financing obstacles as they import the American AI stack,\" through other soft-power institutions such as the World Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.",

    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin fell as much as 5% to below $65,000 on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to raise global tariffs to 15%. The drop came as Asian equities rose in early trade, underscoring crypto's divergence from regional stock markets amid renewed tariff uncertainty.Bitcoin has seen a sharp sell-off since October last year when it crossed $125,000, with the downturn extending into the new year. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 26% so far this year and has lost over 47% since the October high. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin drops\"We believe that the sudden uptick in tariff rates is causing investors to sell crypto assets in anticipation of a more serious market decline,\" said Jeff Mei, COO at global blockchain technology company BTSE.Investors are also concerned that the build-up of U.S. military forces around Iran raises the possibility of an armed conflict that could spread regionally and impact global trade flows, he added.There has been massive U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, with Trump signaling last Thursday that he would decide in the next 10 days whether to launch strikes against Iran.Markus Thielen, head of research at market intelligence platform 10x Research, said bitcoin's latest drop was driven less by a single headline and more by weak liquidity and low conviction in the market. Thielen said the downturn fits a typical bear-market phase characterized by low volumes and uncertainty tied to U.S. midterm elections, expecting further downside toward $50,000 before a more durable bottom forms.Safe-haven demand saw spot gold trading over 1% higher Monday, showing a strong divergence from bitcoin, which has often been referred to as \"digital gold,\" including by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency pared some of its losses and was down 3% to $65,167 as of 12.18 a.m. ET. Ether — the second most popular cryptocurrency — was down 3.9% at $1,867.3Earlier this month, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan attributed bitcoin's slide primarily to the crypto market's \"four-year cycle,\" arguing that the current retracement mirrors patterns seen in past downturns. Bitwise has more than $15 billion in assets under management, and is heavily into crypto ETFs.Hougan highlighted there was no single catalyst behind the losses, pointing instead to investors rotating into gold and artificial intelligence stocks, lingering concerns over Fed nominee Kevin Warsh and broader \"quantum risk.\" Bitcoin had hit a more than 1-year low of $63,119.8 on Feb. 5.— CNBC's Blair Bao contributed to this report.",

(Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images)Prakash Singh | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's trade negotiators will reschedule their planned visit to Washington, D.C., aimed at firming up an interim trade deal with the U.S., a person familiar with the development told CNBC.The development comes after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs as illegal on Friday. Within hours, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to first impose a 10% global import tariff, before increasing that to 15%.The \"meeting will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient date,\" the source told CNBC Sunday. India and the U.S. are of the view that the visit \"be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications.\"CNBC has reached out to India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a comment.India's chief negotiator, Darpan Jain, and his team were scheduled to start the three day-meeting in the U.S. later this week.India is currently facing a 25% reciprocal tariff, which was due to be cut to 18% after the two sides agreed to an interim deal earlier this month, with room for alterations.\"In the event of any changes to the agreed-upon tariffs of either country, the United States and India agree that the other country may modify its commitments,\" read the joint statement issued on Feb. 6, by the U.S. and India.At this stage, it appears that India, like other countries, will be facing a 15% tariff in addition to the most-favored-nation status rates (usually around 2-3%), said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative and a former Indian trade negotiator.Rethinking strategySince the Feb. 6 announcement, both sides had been meeting virtually to discuss the path forward, according to a local media report. The in-person meetings, planned for this coming week, with the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, were seen as the precursor to the finalization of the legal text of the agreement between India and the U.S.India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said Friday that the interim trade agreement between the two nations would likely be signed in March and implemented in April.\"The 18% tariff negotiations were based on a certain premise of some benefits which is now gone. Now, both sides have to rethink their strategy, and the U.S. has to deal with more pressing issues,\" Srivastava said.",

    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"",

    "body": "The original six American Girl historical characters — Kirsten Larson, Samantha Parkington, Molly McIntire, Felicity Merriman, Addy Walker and Josefina Montoya — are displayed at the brand’s flagship store,Luke FountainThe flagship American Girl Place at Rockefeller Center in New York City feels frozen in time.The air smells faintly of vanilla. Young girls dart between doll displays clutching miniature shirts and sequined shoes. Beneath glittering chandeliers, the brand's iconic red boxes line shelves with museum-like precision. Blow dryers hum in the Doll Salon, and downstairs, pink-frosted cupcakes land on cafe tables before dolls sitting upright in their miniature highchairs.\"It feels timeless,\" said Jamie Cygielman, global head of dolls for Mattel, the brand's parent company. And yet, behind the scenes, the business of American Girl dolls is not what it once was. As American Girl turns 40, the brand is navigating more modern challenges: digital competition, shifting play patterns and an aging, more cost-conscious customer base. \"The anniversary is at precarious moment for American Girl and the whole doll industry,\" said Jaime Katz, an analyst who covers Mattel for Morningstar. \"Kids are more digital in play, and the [American Girl] brand has struggled.\"Around a decade ago, at its peak, American Girl was recording more than $600 million in annual sales. By 2023, annual sales had fallen to roughly $200 million — just a third of prior levels.While American Girl has shrunk back considerably from the mid-2010s, the brand has more recently posted five consecutive quarters of sales growth — one of the few steady performers inside Mattel's portfolio. \"Growing off a base that's down more than 60% doesn't mean the brand is back. It means it's stabilizing,\" Katz told CNBC.Earlier this month, Mattel reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.77 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations after holiday demand came in lighter than projected and heavier discounting weighed on margins. Earnings per share likewise fell short, and Mattel issued a lower-than-expect profit forecast for 2026.Mattel shares have fallen roughly 19% since the Feb. 10 report and are down about 20% over the past year. Citi and JPMorgan downgraded the stock after the results, too. \"People are watching Mattel this year ... waiting with baited breath, because they are spending a ton and it seems unlikely they will be bringing in big profits,\" Katz said.A doll gets her hair washed, brushed and curled at the American Girl Salon at the brand's flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainLongstanding issuesEven before the Covid pandemic forced American Girl to reduce its retail footprint from about 15 stores in 2019 to seven U.S. locations today, the brand faced mounting competition from lower-priced alternatives at big-box retailers like Target's \"Our Generation\" line. A traditional, 18-inch American Girl typically starts at $135, excluding accessories, which can cost as much as $250 for a bunk bed or $275 for a beach cruiser. The premium price once signaled to many parents a mark of quality and prestige, said Laura Tretter, co-host of the American Girl Women podcast. But in an inflation-conscious environment, it's narrowed the customer base, Katz said.\"Parents are more selective about discretionary spending right now,\" Katz said. \"That price point [for an American Girl doll] looks steep to many households.\"Across the toy industry, companies, including competitors like Hasbro, are grappling with how to get kids interested in their products, particularly amid uneven consumer spending and, recently, trade uncertainty. \"There are so many more things today that a kid might be enticed by to play with,\" Cygielman told CNBC. \"There's also more competition today, and we saw in the past that tariffs can make an impact on the toy market, but we adapt.\"For many kids, play has migrated toward tablets, gaming subscriptions and short-form video. \"The definition of 'toy' has changed,\" Katz said. \"A iPad or Nintendo Switch competes directly with a doll. There are simply more claims on the same discretionary dollar.\"Overall, Mattel's doll and preschool categories have faced steady declines for the last three quarters, even after the halo effect of 2023's \"Barbie\" movie. Global dolls sales fell 7% in the latest quarter, while the infant, toddler and preschool segment declined 17%.Struggling sales for American Girl and Mattel's Fisher Price brand motivated activist investor Barington Capital in 2024 to push the company to streamline its portfolio and improve returns, floating the possibility of selling off the brands. \"American Girl is not a huge part of Mattel's overall financial profile,\" Katz said. \"Still though, for investors, the question isn't whether the brand is beloved. It's whether it's strategically essential. It was a drag on profits.\"A girl waits with her new Truly Me doll at the American Girl flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainCapitalizing on loyaltyInside the Rockefeller Center store, those industry headwinds feel distant.On a recent visit, Lisa Kandoski stood gazing at Molly McIntire — the World War II-era heroine adorned with round wire-rimmed glasses, a navy argyle sweater and braids tied in red ribbons — just like the doll Kandoski said her grandmother put under the Christmas tree in 1990.\"It's not just a doll,\" Kandoski, now 40, told CNBC, her eyes misty. \"I sort of realized the impact Molly had on me as a kid. She taught me that you could be brave even when the world was scary, that you could 'do your part' even when you were small. She shaped who I am.\"That emotional alchemy has defined American Girl since it disrupted the doll industry in 1986. At the time, the market was dominated by either fashion dolls mirroring adulthood or baby dolls to rehearse motherhood. The original six American Girl characters — Samantha, Kirsten, Molly, Felicity, Addy and Josefina — came with books tackling subjects rarely taught to young kids like child labor or racism, and all dolls treated girlhood itself as a formative stage.\"American Girl remains a moral compass for many of us,\" said Tretter of the American Girl Women podcast. \"I love that girls today are still getting positive messages about inclusivity, friendship and going through difficult changes.\"Over time, American Girl expanded into publishing, film and destination retail while diversifying its characters, like with the 2026 \"Girl of the Year,\" Raquel Reyes, a biracial DJ and animal rescuer who helps run her family's Kansas City paleta shop.The brand's whimsical seriousness became a differentiator and fostered generational loyalty, said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a folklorist and author of \"An American Girl Anthology: Finding Ourselves in the Pleasant Company Universe.\"Look no further than the Doll Hospital where white-coated \"doctors\" triage patients, fit wheelchairs, perform eye exams, and apply miniature casts for doll owners of all ages.\"That's why people return,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"You're not just buying plastic and fabric. You're revisiting a version of yourself.\"And even though the dolls remain preserved in childhood innocence, their original owners, now grown up, keep returning to American Girl through podcasts, memes, cosplay and fan fiction. Some pass their dolls down to their children. Others buy new ones for themselves.\"There's something powerful about handing your daughter the doll you once slept beside,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"It's also just as comforting to go back to the days of your youth with your own doll.\" American Girl is releasing modernized version of its original six characters for the brand's 40th anniversary.MattelA growing baseMattel is battling to convert that nostalgia into broader sales growth. So‑called \"kidult\" consumers — adults who buy toys for themselves — have become a coveted demographic. By late 2024, spending on toys for adults 18 and older had surpassed that for children ages 3 to 5, according to market research firm Circana. That cohort continued to drive industry growth in 2025.Mattel has increasingly sought to monetize its intellectual property through publishing, collectibles, entertainment and digital platforms. In interviews and on calls with investors, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz has said that mobile games and interactive platforms are particularly promising areas. However, \"nostalgia must translate into durable revenue and sales growth,\" Katz said. Lean too heavily into adult collectors, and a brand risks \"aging alongside its original audience.\" Pivot too aggressively toward digital trends, and it \"risks diluting what made it distinctive.\"Competitors have been doing the same. For instance, Lego continues to release more brick building sets aimed at adults like flowers, art and collectables based on millennial pop culture favorites such as the 1990s TV hit \"Friends.\" For American Girl, its 40th anniversary offers a natural inflection point to strike a balance between kid and adult fans, Cygielman said.American Girl is releasing modernized versions of its original six characters and publishing its first book for adults, centered on Samantha Parkington and set during her adulthood in the 1920s. At the same time, the brand is working to keep the next generation engaged through contemporary \"Girl of the Year\" storylines and investments in digital platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and \"American Girl World\" on Roblox.\"Nostalgia is an entry point, not the endgame,\" Cygielman said. \"The question is how we extend that emotional equity into new platforms and new audiences.\"",

    "body": "Hyperscalers are significantly ramping up their AI capex spending — and increasingly using credit markets to fund it.  But investors say this shift is challenging mega-cap tech giants' so-called 'fortress balance sheet' status, and rips up what they call the \"unspoken contract\" that kept speculative AI spending largely separate from debt markets.After Amazon, Meta and Google-owner Alphabet all unveiled sizable increases in their full-year capex spending plans during earnings season, UBS data indicates that aggregated capex spend among AI hyperscalers could top $770 billion in 2026 — some 23% higher than previously expected.In a Feb. 18 note, UBS credit strategists said such increases imply a $40 billion to $50 billion ramp-up in borrowing from hyperscalers, pushing public market debt issuance to between $230 to $240 billion this year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOracle.Al Cattermole, fixed income portfolio manager at Mirabaud Asset Management, said this tilt toward the bond market is dramatically shifting the dynamic between hyperscalers and investors.\"For years, we've been told this AI spend would be funded by generated cash flow — that it is equity risk, it is speculative, and not to worry about it from a credit point of view,\" Cattermole told CNBC in an interview.\"There now seems to be a change in the unspoken contract that while we would continue to lend to these businesses, really AI capex was still going to be equity or cash funded….By bringing capex spend into the debt markets, you now have the question of credit worthiness.\"'Break point'Last September, Oracle tapped the bond market for some $18 billion in one of the biggest debt issuances on record. Others have rapidly followed, with Google-owner Alphabet recently issuing some $20 billion in debt, including a rare 100-year sterling-denominated bond. That's placing the sector's debt load under sharper scrutiny.\"Everyone had been treating these AA- or A-rated tech companies as essentially cash-plus. Then, suddenly, to be putting this amount of debt on the balance sheet, that's been quite the turn,\" Cattermole said. \"It's only been three or four months since we've had this turn — everyone's getting used to it in a new way.\"Investors now see trouble up ahead. BlackRock said mega-cap tech companies are using the current credit issuance \"bonanza\" to bridge the gap between current investment and future revenues.\"The problem: rising corporate borrowing adds supply to bond markets struggling to digest large public deficits,\" BlackRock said in its weekly market commentary.watch now\"What has changed is the market's focus: it now asks how AI adoption will translate into revenues and profits. This sorting of winners and losers means it's prime time for active investing,\" BlackRock added.The world's largest asset manager noted that AI builders have largely tapped the U.S. investment grade market, \"so we prefer high yield and European bonds.\"As Oracle's share price has trended lower over the past six months, credit default swaps on its bonds — which offer protection in the event of a borrower being unable to repay its debt — have seen sharp bouts of volatility.Cattermole, meanwhile, pointed to Alphabet's planned capex of almost 50% of its revenue for next year, which he said was approaching an \"unheard-of level.\"\"You wouldn't see that for a normal company at any point in time,\" he added. \"We are very clearly at a break point in natural cycles.\"'Hidden risks'Underlining concerns over a potential debt-fueled AI overspend, investors fear that the huge data centers that are key to the buildout could be rendered obsolete by rapid technical improvements that make chips more efficient and reduce demand for capacity. That carries far-reaching implications for debtholders, according to Cattermole.\"What if, in three years, these Nvidia chips get outstripped by a Chinese competitor, and I'm lending for five or eight years, and in year three, my data center is obsolete?\" he said.Shaan Raithatha, senior economist at Vanguard, said AI hyperscalers are starting from a very strong position, boasting \"strong balance sheets, strong free cash flow generation, and strong moats\" — but he acknowledged that they are now taking on more leverage.\"Are there hidden risks building in the system, whether it's special purpose vehicles, the greater leasing of assets, greater off-balance sheet activity? The hidden risks are building, we don't know if that's ever going to come up,\" Raithatha told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.\"But, clearly, investors have to be mindful of that when they start to discount stock market returns into the future.\"—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a press briefing at the White House, following the Supreme Court's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 20, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974. However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.1. The economic impactIn a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as \"narrow,\" though there are \"enormous potential winners from this ruling,\" particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026. \"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. \"The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth.\"Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.2. Some help for inflationThe court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year. watch nowInterestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.\"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed,\" Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.3. Relief for the marketFor much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.\"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets,\" said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.4. What about those refunds?Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a \"mess\" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.\"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved,\" Gardner said in a note.5. What now?The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary.One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away. Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures. \"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later,\" wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be \"all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned.\"watch now",

    "body": "Gregory Beard, director of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Courtesy: U.S. Department of EnergyFormer Apollo executive and longtime New Yorker Gregory Beard says he wouldn't have left the private sector for just any job. But opportunity came knocking in the form of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who tapped Beard to run the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Previously known as the Loan Programs Office and part of the Energy Department, the EDF is the largest energy lender in the world, with some $289 billion in loan authority currently.Beard first joined the EDF as a senior advisor in April 2025 from bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining, before officially taking over as director on Jan. 29.\"If I didn't feel passionately about Secretary Wright's message and why the president chose him, I'd still be in the private sector,\" Beard said in an exclusive conversation with CNBC. Beard has only been at the helm for a few weeks, but he has big plans for the agency, including dispensing capital at a record rate. And at a time when the energy complex is seeing a generational shift and natural resources increasingly drive geopolitics, the EDF can be a key tool in shaping the future of energy in the U.S.Shaking up the officeBeard says the first order of business was to reexamine the loans granted during the Biden administration, the majority of which were approved in the months between Election Day 2024 and the inauguration. The result of the \"turnaround job,\" as he called it, impacted more than 80% of the Biden-era portfolio, or about $83.6 billion worth of loans, according to the Department of Energy. Most were focused on emissions-reducing projects.The review process included making sure projects that stayed in the portfolio align with the Trump administration's energy goals, Beard said. All told, roughly $30 billion in conditional loan commitments were either canceled or withdrawn by the applicant, with about $53 billion worth of loans restructured, the DOE said.The goal was to protect taxpayers, and to focus on affordability and reliability, Beard said. \"This is not a reversal of policies — it's a protection of dollars,\" he said. Solar panels at the Boulder Solar 1 facility in Boulder City, Nevada, Nov. 23, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersThe EDF dates back to 2005. The agency has acted as a bridge of sorts for U.S. companies that might struggle to secure financing via traditional capital markets due to perceived risks. In theory, the rigorous process to secure an EDF loan could be seen as a stamp of approval from the government, opening up additional funding to help nascent companies and technologies get off the ground. Over its more than 20 years there have been hits — including a 2010 loan to Tesla — and misses, most notably backing solar manufacturer Solyndra, which ultimately went bankrupt.Under President Joe Biden and his climate-focused administration, the agency was supercharged, acting as a green bank of sorts. Staff quadrupled, and the Inflation Reduction Act grew available funds by tenfold.But with the new administration, the office has changed course, shedding the green angle that President Donald Trump has called a scam. In addition to an official name change, the agency is now focused on six areas: nuclear; coal, oil, gas and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal; grid and transmission; and manufacturing and transportation.\"Every project that we do will make energy more affordable for Americans, will help us win AI and will bolster the grid and get us out from under the China strategy to dominate certain critical minerals,\" Beard said. \"Everything we do will have a very specific focus.\"EDF now 'open for business'During the first Trump administration, the EDF was largely dormant. But now, Beard said, the office is ready to get going. \"We have direction. We are open for business. … We will, I think, invest this capital in America's future in record time,\" he said.The office has about 80 active loan applications in its pipeline, according to Beard. It's a mix of new projects as well as those that have been reframed to meet the administration's priorities, he said.The reorganized EDF has dispensed three loans to AEP, Constellation Energy and Wabash Valley Resources. All three originated during the prior administration. But Beard said the pace will soon pick up, hinting that an upcoming announcement could be the agency's largest-ever loan.\"The initial quarters were really a turnaround job for fixing what this office had done in the past,\" he said. \"Now we're focused on the future.\"The first soup-to-nuts loan from the EDF will likely act as a starting point for a \"wave of loans around affordability, reliability and increased generation on the grid,\" Beard said, adding that a \"big portion of capital\" will end up focusing on power costs.Affordability is becoming a bigger issue as the midterms approach. Electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation, becoming a pain point for consumers who are feeling pinched on all sides. For years, power demand grew at a steady clip, giving utilities, which plan sometimes decades in advance, visibility into future needs. But that's changing. Power demand is rising for a few reasons, including the voracious power needs of artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing and broader electrification. Reliability is also a key issue. A lack of accessible power is seen as one potential bottleneck in the AI arms race with China. Increasingly frequent and severe storms, attributed to climate change, are another source of stress on the power grid.The Trump administration has announced a host of initiatives it says will help meet the demand, including earlier in February ordering the Defense Department to purchase coal power and keep coal-fired plants running. U.S. coal use has been declining for years thanks to competition from cheaper gas and renewables. Beard hopes his EDF can address the supply crunch. One avenue is to focus on maximizing existing generation, he said. \"We need to refurbish and refresh existing generation, not shut if off. And not make the hill that's already a mountain that much tougher to climb,\" he said.Newbuilds are also part of the picture, he said. \"We need to remember again how important it is to do it and to build. So that's really what we're pushing,\" he said.Permitting delays can challenge new projects. Many regions in the country have a yearslong backlog of projects that want to connect to the grid. Amid the supply crunch, some have criticized the administration's decision to cancel several offshore wind projects that were more than 90% complete. (Judges have since ordered construction to resume.) Critics think the administration should be more open to wind and solar, which can be produced at lower costs and in some cases connect to the grid faster. One way to compare costs across energy sources is by looking at the levelized cost of energy, or LCOE. According to widely cited data from Lazard, new utility-scale solar ranges in cost from $38-$78 per megawatt-hour. Onshore wind is $37-$86/MWh, gas combined cycle is $48-$109/MWh and coal is $71-$173/MWh. However, the LCOE fails to take into consideration the value of dispatchable resources as well as capacity factor, or the amount of time an asset is producing at its maximum output. Nuclear has the highest capacity factor at over 90%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Combined-cycle gas is at roughly 69%, with coal at 43%. Wind and solar are at 34% and 23%, respectively. Everything 'on the table' for new nuclearThe EDF has traditionally been an important backer of capital-intensive nuclear projects, which have at times come in over budget and behind schedule. And now, with the Trump administration throwing its weight behind nuclear and calling to quadruple U.S. capacity by 2050, nuclear is a priority for the agency. \"We can't lean in any harder,\" Beard said, adding that more activity in the space is expected in coming months and quarters. The agency is willing to lend up to 80% of the project cost, he said.Electrical transmission towers, poles and lines are shown in the early morning of a hot summer day in Commerce, California, Aug. 7, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersTech companies also have turned to nuclear to power their data centers given it's the only source of emissions-free baseload power. Hyperscalers have signed power purchase agreements with the likes of Constellation and Vistra at above-market prices, indicating how desirable nuclear power is — reactors are online 24/7, unlike wind and solar power. Big tech has also backed small modular reactor companies, or SMRs, which promise faster timelines and controlled costs.The EDF in November finalized a $1 billion loan to Constellation Energy to restart its shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island, now known as the Crane Clean Energy Center. The agency previously provided $12 billion to Southern Company to build reactors 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle, as well as a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to Holtec to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Covert Township, Michigan. At present there are no commercial-scale reactors under construction in the U.S., although Westinghouse — maker of the AP1000 reactor — said it plans to build 10 large reactors, with construction beginning in 2030.Beard pointed to Trump's extension of the investment tax credit as advantageous for the industry. He said the EDF plans to support these long lead time projects.\"We spent the last year costing out and creating the incentive structures to let this industry flourish again,\" he said. \"Our view is everything that is required to restart this industry is on the table.\" Breaking China's minerals dominance Another key focus for the EDF will be critical minerals, as part of a broader push for the U.S. to shore up domestic supplies and move away from foreign dependence. China has weaponized metals in the past by restricting exports of rare earths, and given it dominates metal supply chains — especially when it comes to refining — there's fear they could curb other exports.Beard said that the Department of Defense is working on solving \"crisis-level issues,\" but that EDF plans to back companies seeking to break China's chokehold on metals key for everything from consumer products to the power grid and AI. \"If China is in year 10 of a 20-year plan, we will intervene and support those projects and companies that interrupt that strategy,\" he said. Although the agency's reorganization meant a reduction in staff, Beard said it won't slow the pace of loans or hurt the quality of projects it backs. Instead, he said, fewer people will be needed because the EDF will focus on projects that can be replicated, rather than one-of-a-kind projects that don't make economic sense.\"I'm only really a professional investor and a new government guy,\" he said. \"The discipline is make sure we are doing projects that benefit Americans and will be repaid.\"",

The Port of Balboa is managed by CK Hutchison Holdings, based in Hong Kong.   Martin Bernetti | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.K., the European Union and Singapore face higher trade-weighted tariffs, while countries such as Brazil, China and India will see such levies go down after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise global duties to 15%.This comes after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies. Trump later responded by imposing a global 10% duty under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which was then raised to 15%. On a trade-weighted basis, the U.K. faces a 2.1 percentage point increase in its average tariff rate, while the EU sees a 0.8 point rise, according to analysis from Swiss-based trade watchdog Global Trade Alert. In contrast, Brazil's rate plunges 13.6 points, and China's drops 7.1 points.The EU Commission said it would request \"full clarity\" on the ruling, noting that \"a deal was a deal,\" with no increases in tariffs beyond the 15% ceiling previously agreed. The 27-member bloc had agreed a trade deal with the U.S. back in August last year that would see exports to Washington capped at a 15% tariff. Asian allies Japan and South Korea face an increase in their trade-weighted average tariff rate of 0.4 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. Both countries had agreed to a 15% tariff on their exports to the U.S. last year. Tariff exposureWhile some experts said the Supreme Court's decision delivers the greatest relief to countries previously hit hardest by IEEPA-linked tariffs, others told CNBC it disadvantages nations that first negotiated trade deals with the U.S.Johannes Fritz, CEO of the St.Gallen Endowment for Prosperity through Trade and author of the GTA report, said countries like China, Mexico and Canada faced dedicated tariff orders tied to opioids and border security, on top of the reciprocal rates from April 2025. Brazil and India also faced their own separate IEEPA orders. \"The Supreme Court struck down all of these, not just the reciprocal tariffs. So the countries that had the heaviest IEEPA exposure received the greatest relief,\" he explained to CNBC. Fritz noted that the EU and other allies, whose IEEPA burden was largely limited to the reciprocal rates, saw a smaller reduction. watch nowCountries that had negotiated a 10% \"reciprocal rate,\" like the U.K., as well as countries receiving the baseline 10% rate like Singapore, Australia and Saudi Arabia, will then see their trade-weighted tariff rate rise, as the IEEPA tariffs are now replaced by Section 122 duties. However, Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South Program at the Quincy Institute, had a different view, telling CNBC \"Inside India\" that \"those countries that were early in striking deals with the United States after the Liberation Day tariffs of last year have been sort of left holding the bag.\"\"Whereas those other countries that resisted, like Brazil and others in agreeing to any demands from the United States may be feeling a little more vindicated,\" he added. Shidore's view was echoed by Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis. \"Countries which were suffering from higher tariffs and had not negotiated a major reduction will benefit more,\" she told CNBC. She pointed out Japan, which saw its \"reciprocal tariffs\" lowered to 15% in exchange for a $550 billion investment pledge into the U.S. last year.\"The government has confirmed they will keep their investment in the U.S. notwithstanding the Supreme Court decision. In other words, they are paying to receive the same treatment as others,\" Herrero said. Asian nations reactIn Asia, countries have mostly taken a wait-and-see approach to the Supreme Court ruling and Section 122 tariffs. China's ministry of commerce said in a statement Monday that it is conducting a \"comprehensive assessment\" of the Supreme Court ruling, and also urged the U.S. to \"cancel its unilateral tariffs on its trading partners.\"India's trade negotiators had planned to visit Washington, D.C. to firm up an interim trade deal that would see levies cut to 18% on New Delhi's exports, but have now postponed that trip, a source told CNBC. watch nowOver in South Korea, Kim Jung-kwan, the country's minister of trade, industry and resources, said Seoul will pursue amicable consultations \"to ensure that the balance of benefits and favorable export conditions secured through the Korea-U.S. tariff agreement are not undermined.\" While Japan has not issued an official response, officials told Nikkei Asia that the ruling would not affect Japan's first round of investment projects in the U.S., with other officials also saying that Tokyo was keen to preserve its trade deal with Washington.  The 15% tariff also appears to apply to countries like Singapore, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S. Singapore will see its effective tariff rate climb 1.1 percentage points, according to GTA. The city state had been hit with the global 10% \"reciprocal tariff,\" despite its trade deficit. A spokesperson from the country's trade and industry ministry said Singapore is monitoring the situation closely, and will engage with its \"U.S. counterparts to seek clarity on the implementation of the new Section 122 tariffs and processes for tariff refunds.\"Confusion aheadOverall, one word seems to characterise the trade landscape after the Supreme Court ruling: confusion. While Trump had announced the 15% levy via Truth Social, the White House's fact sheet still puts the Section 122 tariffs at 10%. Quincy Institute's Shidore puts it plainly: \"I think right now, there's just a lot of confusion.\" His comments were echoed by Claudio Galimberti, chief economist at Rystad Energy, who wrote that the actual impact on trade remains \"uncertain.\" Galimberti also cast doubt on the bilateral trade agreements between the U.S. and its trading partners, saying that those negotiated deals were structured around IEEPA tariff rates as the baseline.\"At present, it appears the U.S. has lost the ability to enforce those rates, and any prior renegotiated rates stemming from IEEPA tariffs are now replaced by the uniform 10% rate under Section 122,\" he said, adding that the components under Section 232 remain legally intact. GTA's Fritz also highlighted the same issue, saying it is not clear how product-level carve-outs for individual countries can be legally implemented.The EU deal, for example, contained provisions for Portuguese cork exports, but Section 122 requires non-discriminatory application across all trading partners.\"[Trading partners] made concessions in exchange for specific tariff treatment that was grounded in IEEPA. That legal basis no longer exists. Whether the administration can reconstruct those deals under Section 301 or other authorities remains to be seen, but that will take time and new legal processes,\" Fritz said.— CNBC's Amitoj Singh helped contribute to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will seek a truce in their bruising trade war on October 30, with the US president predicting a \"great meeting\" but Beijing being more circumspect. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)          Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs has strengthened China's hand ahead of a summit with his counterpart Xi Jinping, where Beijing is expected to push for reduced U.S. support for Taiwan, analysts said. In a ruling Friday, the court said Trump wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement broad tariffs. That decision has weakened Trump's negotiating leverage as he prepared for a trip to Beijing in April, said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.\"He has effectively had his wings clipped on his signature economic policy,\" said Cutler, who was also a former U.S. trade representative.  Trump will visit China from March 31 to April 2, the first trip by an American president since his last visit in 2017. Xi is also expected to make a state visit to Washington later this year. Analysts said the ruling could change the dynamics around efforts to extend a trade truce negotiated last year and complicate Trump's push for Beijing to buy large quantities of U.S. soybeans, Boeing aircraft and energy exports.\"It limits Trump's ability to deploy tariffs at will, reduces pressure on Beijing to expand soybean purchases or ease rare earth access, and gives China leverage to push for the removal of the remaining 10% tariffs linked to fentanyl,\" said Dan Wang, China director of Eurasia Group. For Beijing's part, it could use the opportunity to press Washington to ease technology export controls, remove certain Chinese entities from U.S. sanctions lists, and cut back arms sales to Taiwan, said Xinbo Wu, director at Fudan University's Center for American Studies.\"[The ruling] certainly helps strengthen China's position in its negotiation with the U.S,\" Wu said.Non-tariff tools While Trump's tariff authority may be somewhat diminished, he could deploy non-tariff measures, such as technology controls and sanctions against Chinese entities, as negotiating tools, experts said. \"The measures with real structural impact remain non-tariff tools,\" said Wang. These include expanded export controls on advanced chips and broader restrictions against Chinese tech firms, Wang said.The U.S. stance on the Taiwan issue, disputes over the South China Sea and security ties with Japan and Korea still rest largely with Trump, he added.  In a statement Monday, China's commerce ministry said it is currently assessing the impacts from the implementation of the ruling, while urging the U.S. to remove all unilateral tariffs against its trading partners. \"China and the U.S. both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,\" according to the ministry's statement translated by CNBC. watch nowFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump responded with a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 — before raising it further to 15%, which the president said would be \"effective immediately.\" In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump dangled a warning that more tariffs would follow: \"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs.\" It remains unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET. Before the ruling, Washington had imposed an additional 20% tariff on Chinese exports last year —including a 10% reciprocal tariff and a 10% fentanyl-related tariff — citing IEEPA authority. The Supreme Court's ruling implies a net reduction of around 5% in U.S. tariffs on China, according to Goldman Sachs. \"Overall, this development suggests upside risk to our positive outlook on Chinese exports this year,\" Goldman said. A study by the trade monitoring body Global Trade Alert also named China among the top winners under the revised Section 122 tariff regime, with a 7.1 percentage point reduction in tariff rates. John Gong, a former consultant to China's commerce ministry, said that Beijing is not \"betting their strategy on the dispute between the executive and judicial branches of the [U.S.] government, although a lower tariff rate 'is something nice to have.'\" 301 Section investigationStill, China faces an ongoing Section 301 investigation launched last year over its compliance with the Phase One trade deal from Trump's first term. watch nowThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in October last year that China appeared not to have met its commitments to expand market access, lower non-tariff barriers, and ramp up purchases of U.S. goods and services, despite repeated U.S. engagement to address implementation concerns.  \"Once the U.S. has decided that a country is an 'unfair' trade partner, Section 301 comes with substantial flexibilities to use tariffs or other measures,\" said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. China said Monday that it is \"watching closely\" the U.S. move in using trade investigations to maintain higher tariffs, vowing to \"firmly safeguard\" Chinese interests.The ruling may have a limited impact on broader U.S.-China relations, said Scott Kennedy from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who noted that tensions extend beyond tariffs. \"The [Supreme Court] ruling doesn't upend U.S.-China relations the way it might to U.S. ties with its allies and others, because China had already gained the upper hand,\" he said. watch nowKennedy expects the April summit to yield limited results, such as an extension of the ceasefire and sales of U.S. products, but progress is unlikely on thornier issues such as clear guidelines for export controls or rebalancing China's economy.During a phone call earlier this month, Xi asserted to Trump that Taiwan is the \"most important issue\" in U.S.-China relations — overshadowing the commercial deals Trump touted at the time, including Chinese purchases of American energy and agricultural products.Upcoming talks between the two leaders may prove more political than economic, said Minxin Pei, a professor of political science at Claremont McKenna College. Xi might be \"open to giving Trump a better commercial deal\" in exchange for a statement on Taiwan that Beijing could claim as a victory, Pei said. — CNBC's Elaine Yu contributed to this story. ",

International benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.6% to $71.33 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were 0.78% lower at $65.96.\"The Supreme Court ruling is a setback ... but it is not an end to his policy agenda,\" said Arthur Laffer, Jr., president of Laffer Tengler Investments.Laffer said countries such as Vietnam and India that struck trade deals with the U.S. should think twice before backing away from those agreements, arguing that trade remains a central pillar of Trump's political and economic strategy and that the president is likely to keep pressing the issue.On Friday, U.S. stocks rose after the Supreme Court ruling, potentially providing relief for companies burdened by higher costs from the duties and easing concern about sticky inflation still plaguing the U.S. economy.The S&P 500 advanced 0.69% and closed at 6,909.51, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and settled at 22,886.07.

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersLONDON — European stocks began the week in negative territory as global markets react to U.S. President Donald Trump's latest global tariffs policy.The pan-European Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% shortly after 8:25 a.m. in London (3:25 a.m. ET), with most sectors and major bourses trading lower.European markets had ended last week higher after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a sizeable chunk of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, but the president said over the weekend that he would now introduce a new, blanket 15% global levy, up from 10%. The new tariffs would be \"effective immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. He also warned Saturday that additional levies would follow.\"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been \"ripping\" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,\" he wrote.Read moreU.K. sports retailer JD Sports rose to the top of the Stoxx 600, advancing almost 4% after announcing Monday it will return about £200 million ($270 million) to investors through a share buyback program.Rolls-Royce shares were down 0.6% following reports that the British aerospace and defense multinational is preparing a new £1.5 billion share buyback as part of its annual earnings statement, due on Thursday.  A Rolls-Royce spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.Specialist chemicals producer Johnson Matthey's shares collapsed 12%, sending it to the bottom of the European index, after it agreed to reduce by a quarter the price of its Catalyst Technologies to £1.3 billion, which is being acquired by Honeywell International.It's a quiet start to the new trading week with no earnings expected on Monday. U.K. alcoholic drinks staple Diageo and German sportswear imprint Puma are among the European companies set to publish results later in the week.On the data front, Germany's Ifo business climate survey is released and Italy's latest inflation data is due.

    "body": "Morsa Images | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThere's a line item in homebuyers' closing costs that's causing a clash in the mortgage industry: the fee for lenders to check borrowers' credit.While the charges — typically in the tens or hundreds of dollars — represent a tiny slice of the amount that buyers pay when a home purchase is finalized, the cost has risen sharply in recent years. Costs in 2026 could rise an average 40% to 50%, according to a Dec. 12 letter from the Mortgage Bankers Association to Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte.The trade association asked the FHFA to give mortgage lenders the option of relying on a single credit report instead of three — known as a \"tri-merge\" report — for borrowers with a credit score of 700 or higher.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHomebuyers are paying more for credit checks.

Nevertheless, most homebuyers have higher credit scores, and so stand to benefit from such a change. In 2024, the average credit score for a first-time homebuyer was 734, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For repeat buyers, the average score was 775. The FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the largest purchasers of mortgages on the secondary market. Currently, lenders that want to sell mortgages to Fannie and Freddie — most do, because those transactions provide them with capital to make more loans — must use a tri-merge report, which reflects credit scores and reports from the three largest credit-reporting companies: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.\"The cost of the requirement to have a tri-merge report has gone up exponentially,\" said Al Bingham, a loan officer with mortgage lender Momentum Loans in Sandy, Utah. \"It's nuts.\"Closing costs range from 3% to 6% of loan amountOf course, credit reporting fees are only one of many expenses that have jumped in recent years, both for housing and in the broader economy. And for homebuyers, the rising fees they pay for credit reports and scores might go unnoticed next to much larger numbers when they settle on their loan.Buyers face other closing costs, including loan origination and underwriting fees, as well as agent commissions and expenses such as a home appraisal or inspection. Collectively, those costs generally range from 3% to 6% of the loan amount and are in addition to any down payment. For illustration: For a $350,000 mortgage, that would be $7,000 to $21,000.Bingham shared one example of pricing that showed a 40.4% year-over-year increase in the specific cost for a basic tri-merge report, going to $47.05 in 2026 from $33.50 last year for an individual applicant. That amount is on the low end, he said.Lenders typically pull a borrower's credit report twice in the home-purchase process — once at application and again just before the loan closes to ensure nothing significant has changed. So, if a lender did a tri-merge report both times, the above amount would be double for an individual, at $94.10, Bingham said. For a couple, it would be quadruple, or $188.20. However, prices vary from lender to lender.In other words, these prices are grabbing a lot of attention despite being a fraction of what buyers pay for closing costs, not to mention the house itself, said John Ulzheimer, a credit expert and president of The Ulzheimer Group in Atlanta.\"I get it that they want to save [on that expense], but to me that is an immaterial cost when you look at the cost of making a bad decision on a mortgage loan,\" Ulzheimer said, adding that three reports provide more information than one.\"I think most risk managers would likely tell you … that they'd never turn away more information to make a decision,\" he said.Part of the problem for lenders is that if a potential homebuyer ends up not finalizing the transaction, the cost of the credit report isn't passed on to the buyer — which means the lender eats the cost, Bingham said.FHFA is studying 'a variety of options'The MBA's December letter to the FHFA outlined its proposal. The group reiterated it in written testimony to a congressional subcommittee at a hearing last week on homeownership and the role of the secondary mortgage market.It's uncertain whether the FHFA is considering the proposal for single-report usage. A spokesperson told CNBC in an email that the agency is \"studying a variety of options to fix the housing market.\"watch nowOf course, there is opposition to the proposal as well. The Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents credit-reporting firms including Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, issued a statement in support of continuing the tri-merge report, saying it promotes data accuracy, market competition and investor confidence.There's also a lot of finger-pointing in the industry over why credit report prices have jumped. In its statement, the CDIA said FICO has \"steadily increased its pricing year over year.\" FICO provides the \"classic\" FICO credit score, which, until recently, was the only one lenders could use for mortgages sold to Fannie and Freddie. In a blog post, the Mortgage Bankers Association said both the credit-reporting companies and FICO are responsible.A FICO spokesperson said in an email to CNBC that the company has no control over how its score is priced by other parties, nor the price of credit reports.FICO said in late 2024 that its 2025 royalty of $4.95 per score for mortgage originations marked FICO's fourth royalty increase in the mortgage industry since the score was unveiled in 1989, not counting its inflation boosts over the last several years.The company also launched a direct-to-lender score this year, which would bypass the credit-reporting companies.VantageScore 4.0 approved, but still not in useOther changes related to mortgages and credit scores are also percolating: The FHFA announced last year that lenders could start using a particular score from VantageScore instead of only the classic FICO score for loans being sold to Fannie and Freddie.VantageScore is a joint venture among Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. It was created in 2006 as a competitor to the FICO score, which has been around since 1989. Both brands use similar data to compute your number — including things like outstanding debt, payment history and other financial tidbits that help predict whether you'll repay what you borrow. The most familiar versions of both VantageScore and FICO result in a score that falls on a scale of 300 to 850.The particular VantageScore that was approved — VantageScore 4.0 — differs from the classic FICO score in several ways, including by considering alternative data such as rent and utility payments when evaluating a consumer's creditworthiness. However, VantageScore 4.0 is not yet deployed.\"While that approval is a significant step, the industry is currently awaiting additional guidance and operational details necessary to implement adoption,\" said Dan Smith, CDIA president and CEO.The FHFA also has approved the use of FICO 10T, a score that also considers alternative data such as patterns in a consumer's credit usage over at least 24 months instead of just a snapshot in time, but the agency has not yet said that lenders can start using it for loans being sold to Fannie and Freddie.",

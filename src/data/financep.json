    "body": "Nestled in a sleepy, suburban subdivision, 4267 Roxbury St. looks like any other home on its Simi Valley, California, block.But the 2,373-square-foot house, with a manicured lawn and red brick walkway, has an infamous Hollywood past: It's the family home featured in the 1982 horror blockbuster \"Poltergeist,\" directed by Tobe Hooper.Rachel Powers purchased the home on 4267 Roxbury St. in October 2024.Steve SierenRachel Powers, a tech worker and mother of three, purchased the nearly 50-year-old home for $1.28 million in October 2024. Since February, she has spent months and close to $200,000 restoring select rooms to match their appearance in the movie, she tells CNBC Make It.\"To me this house still has another story to tell,\" says Powers, who lives in the home about half the year and rents it out to short-term visitors the rest of the time for anywhere from $600 to $1,200 a night, according to the home's website.A 'serendipitous' purchasePowers says she had always known of the home featured in \"Poltergeist,\" just two miles from her sister's home, but she thought the house had sold a month before she started her home search. Regardless, she says she was looking for a smaller home in a lower price range.Then, her sister showed her the Zillow listing.The kitchen, including a cookbook and ceramic jars found in the background of the movie.Steve SierenIn a matter of hours, Powers says she was on the phone with her real estate agent and pre-approved for a mortgage. A few days later, she was under contract to purchase the home for about $105,000 over its initial asking price, she says.\"It was a little surreal,\" Powers says of the \"serendipitous\" turn of events. She initially didn't think she would get the house because there were multiple offers, she says. But ultimately, \"it kind of felt like it was meant to be.\"  Remodeling the home to look like the moviePowers got the keys to the house in November and after the winter holidays and some delays due to wildfires in the area, she got to work revamping it, she says.Powers, a former digital designer for Disney and Apple, scoured thrift shops, eBay and Facebook Marketplace to source the perfect items for the home.One bedroom features some toys found in the movie as well as a clown.Steve SierenFans around the world helped as well. After posting a video to TikTok, Powers says a follower reached out with a link to buy a print that appears above the TV in the movie. Another follower on the East Coast sent Powers a robot toy they found in a local thrift store, she says.\"I've poured a lot of love into the house,\" Powers says. \"The community has been overwhelmingly supportive, which has been a lot of fun. I've been meeting people from all over the world.\"Not every space in the four-bedroom home is renovated to look like the movie, some are modern as well, Powers says.Steve SierenThe kitchen, living room and one bedroom of the house are styled to look like the movie, but not every room is \"Poltergeist\" themed. Guests have the option to watch the movie on VHS in the living room, where many of the film's iconic scenes take place, Powers says.Sharing a home with the worldDespite widespread speculation that the house would be turned into an Airbnb after news broke of the sale last year, Powers says it wasn't her first intention when she bought the house.The extra income is nice as a \"backup\" and the house can be rented through Airbnb, Powers says. However, it's not intended to be a short-term rental akin to a hotel. She shares her home because it's a \"bucket list item\" for many fans to experience the movie in real life.\"There are plenty of hotels if you just want a place to stay,\" says Powers, who packs a bag and stays at her sister's house whenever the house is rented out.Powers says she's hosted anyone from older millennials who have an emotional attachment to the movie to younger content creators who are interested in creating videos around the haunted allure of the home. She even provides a content creation kit for guests upon request, she says.The house also has a back patio and pool guests can use.Steve SierenGuests often share their story with the movie when they make a booking online: how old they were when they watched it, how scared they were and what the movie meant to them. Some even bring their own clowns, she says.\"The smiles I see on people's faces when they go and put their hands on the TV, it's just awesome, and that's why I do it,\" Powers says. \"It's not just special to me, it's special to so many people from around the globe.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

Brian Kaiser | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExxon Mobil is holding advanced talks with power providers and technology companies to cut the emissions of AI data centers that rely on natural gas by deploying carbon capture technology, CEO Darren Woods said on Friday.\"I'm hopeful that many of these hyperscalers are sincere when they talk about the desire to have low emission facilities, because certainly in the near to medium term we're probably the only realistic game in town to accomplish that,\" Woods said on Exxon's earnings call.Hyperscalers refers to companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft that are building large data centers to train and run AI applications.Exxon aims to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by natural gas plants that power data centers, Woods said. The oil major is talking with power companies to decarbonize their plants, he said. \"We're pretty advanced in the conversations,\" the CEO said.The tech sector has mostly secured renewable energy to offset the emissions from their data centers, though they are now making major investments in nuclear power as well.Some companies are turning to natural gas as well as they search for reliable power. Meta, for example, signed an agreement with the utility Entergy in Louisiana to power a data center campus with natural gas.\"We secured locations. We've got the existing infrastructure, certainly have the know-how in terms of the technology of capturing, transporting, and storing [carbon dioxide],\" Woods said.",

    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split Thursday, a move that changes nothing fundamentally about the company, but could make the pricey individual shares more accessible to the retail investor.Existing shareholders as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the past one year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000.It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each a holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same.Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a \"B\" class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Netflix stock is up 42% for the past one year.",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate this week, mortgage rates responded by doing just the opposite.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped 20 basis points since Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut on Wednesday and held a news conference, according to Mortgage News Daily.This happened the last time the Fed lowered its rate as well, and the reason is pretty simple: the bond market had already priced in a cut, but it didn't like the commentary from Powell.On Tuesday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed had fallen to 6.13%, matching the recent low on Sept. 16, which was the day before the Fed announced its last cut, and marking the lowest level in a year.Then this week, after the Fed said it would reduce rates and Powell answered questions in a news conference, that rate shot up 14 basis points on Wednesday and rose another 6 basis points on Thursday, to 6.33%, an even 20 basis points higher than where it was Tuesday. The last time around in September, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage went even higher, to 6.37%.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The market's enthusiasm for 3 Fed rate cuts in 2025 had grown a bit too large for the Fed's liking,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, in a client note. \"The market was nearly 100% certain of another cut in December. The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower rates did not, however, move the needle much for potential homebuyers.",

    "body": "Signage outside the Chevron Corp. headquarters in Houston, Texas, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corp.The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share.Here is what Chevron reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.85 adjusted vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $49.73 billion vs. $49.01 billion expectedU.S. crude oil prices have fallen about 16% this year as OPEC+ increases production and President Donald Trump's tariffs have the market worried about an economic slowdown.Even with lower prices, Chevron pumped a record 4.1 million barrels per day, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year. Higher production came from the Hess acquisition, the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan, according to the company.Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.28 billion, down 34% compared with $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024. It pumped 2 million barrels per day, up 27% from 1.6 million bpd in year-ago period.International production recorded earnings of $2 billion, down 24% compared with $2.64 billion in the same quarter last year. Production increased 16% to 2 million bpd compared with 1.76 million bpd in the year-ago period.Profit increased more than 300% to $638 million in Chevron's downstream U.S. refining business, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2024. Refining profits increased year over year due to higher margins on product sales. International refining posted earnings of $499 million, up 11% from $449 million in the year-ago period.Capital expenditures increased 7% to $4.4 billion over the year-ago quarter because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Chevron's adjusted free cash flow rose about 50% to $7 billion over the year-ago period.Correction: Chevron reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared with $1.68 expected by an LSEG survey of Wall Street analysts. An earlier version misstated the estimate. ",

Ezra Acayan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang doesn't buy the national security concerns over his firm selling its most advanced semiconductors to China, claiming collaboration is in everyone's best interest.Speaking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he will keep campaigning for access to the Chinese market and is \"optimistic\" the country will continue to want U.S. chips as it positions itself as an AI leader.\"The way to think about the China market is, it's a singular, vital, important, dynamic market, and nobody can replace that,\" he said.\"It's in the best interest of America to serve that China market. It's in the best interest of China to have the American technology company bring ... technology to the China market ... It's in the best interest of both countries, and I hope that policymakers will ultimately come to that conclusion.\"watch nowHis comments come amid U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese firms from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI.President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the leaders met, but the discussions did not cover the most advanced Blackwell graphics processing units. \"I said that's really between [China] and Nvidia, but we're sort of the arbitrator,\" Trump said after the meeting.The U.S. says its chip curbs are designed to restrict both China's \"access to the technologies and ability to produce advanced chips\" and curtail its access to \"related computing and AI applications.\"But Huang indicated these concerns are misplaced.\"China makes plenty of AI chips themselves, and the Chinese military surely have plenty of access to chips that are created in China. So, whatever national security concerns, have to take into consideration the fact that China has blocked H20 [an Nvidia chip] and, so, in a lot of ways, China is saying that, 'listen, we have plenty of AI technology ourselves',\" Huang told CNBC's Eunice Yoon on Friday.watch now\"And so the national security concern, from that perspective, I think, is really answered by the fact that China doesn't want H20 or any American chips.\"'Foolish to underestimate Huawei'Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is also at the center of tech tensions between the U.S. and China.The federal use of Huawei products is banned in the U.S. over fears they could be used for spying by the Chinese government, while U.S. firms are also restricted from doing business with the firm. The bans came into force under Trump's first term.Huang said Nvidia is \"miles ahead\" in the chips race, but stressed, \"it is foolish to underestimate the might of China and the incredible, competitive spirit of Huawei.\"\"This is a company with extraordinary technology. They dominate the world's 5G telecommunication standards and technology. They build amazing smartphones, they build amazing chips, they're incredible at networking and so when they announced CloudMatrix, I was not surprised that they were able to create such an amazing thing,\" Huang said, referring to Huawei's large-scale AI supercomputing system.\"It's deeply uninformed to think that Huawei can't build systems. We take competition very seriously. We respect the competition, we respect deeply the capabilities of China. That's why we run so fast, and that's why we dedicate ourselves to inventing the future so we can get there before anybody else,\" he added.— CNBC's Eunice Yoon, Spencer Kimball and Arjun Kharpal contributed to reporting.",

    "body": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Oct. 23, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who was recently thrust into a national debate about the safety of big cities, told CNBC on Thursday that he feels \"pressure every day\" to continue improving conditions for residents. Last week, President Donald Trump reversed plans for a \"federal surge\" in San Francisco. The potential National Guard deployment hit the headlines when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to the city.Benioff's sentiments were supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump administration. Benioff quickly backtracked as criticism mounted. Unlike California Governor Gavin Newsom, Lurie has tried to avoid clashing with Trump since taking office in January. But he has spoken up to say that the city is progressing on business development and crime, often citing data to back up his claims.In Thursday's interview, Lurie's first on television since the Trump incident, the mayor said there's plenty of hard work ahead.\"I felt that pressure in January, I feel it today,\" Lurie said, when asked about support from tech leaders. \"I think they understand... when San Francisco is strong, America is strong.\" watch nowLurie, a moderate Democrat, pointed to an array of data that show the city is making progress on a post-pandemic comeback, largely driven by the boom in investment and usage of artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, as event bookings and tourism are up, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is getting hot.\"We have a lot of competition out there in the world, and we are on the rise,\" Lurie said. \"Anything that would have hindered that rise is something that we don't need.\"Lurie is also leveraging philanthropic commitments to work with the city in cleaning up streets and supporting small businesses. He shared on CNBC Thursday that the San Francisco Downtown Development Corporation has now raised $50 million for this effort, up from the $40 million at launch. The goal is to spark a comeback, with the help of the tech boom in the city, but one that paves the way for all businesses to thrive, he said.\"What we're trying to build here is a broad-based recovery at City Hall,\" Lurie said. \"Our job is to create the conditions so that not only these [tech] companies can succeed, but our restaurants and small businesses can succeed. We're stripping away red tape. We're telling everybody that we're open for business. We want you here, and we want you to be part of the community.\" ",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "Drone view of damage to coastal homes after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Alligator Pond, Jamaica, Oct. 29, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersHurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall this week as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica. The strength of the storm means it will likely trigger a full payout from a catastrophe bond designed to provide funds to the island in the event of catastrophic weather events.The $150 million catastrophe bond, structured by Aon, is intended to help the island's people rebuild after natural disasters by providing Jamaica parametric coverage against losses from named storms. The policy took effect this year and lasts through 2027.The government of Jamaica is the first government in the Caribbean region, and the first of any small island state, to independently sponsor a cat bond, according to Aon. Its likely payout demonstrates the value of a unique type of backstop funded by the private markets.watch nowIn order to trigger the full payment, the storm has to meet a particular strength criteria. The central pressure of the storm must be at or below 900 millibars as its makes landfall and crosses the island nation.Early data from the National Hurricane Center shows Hurricane Melissa's pressure stayed below 900 millibars in several areas. Those readings are in the process of being verified by an independent calculation agent.\"While the final numbers are still being verified, the early signs suggest the transaction is doing what it was designed to do: getting critical funds to the country quickly after a major disaster,\" Chris Lefferdink, Aon's head of insurance-linked securities for North America, said in a statement.  The review process typically takes 2 to 3 weeks, and the earliest possible payout to Jamaica could come in approximately 1 month, according to a spokesperson from Aon.A drone view shows an affected area after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Crane Road, Black River, Jamaica, October 30, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersPrevious parametric transactions payouts have taken 3 months or more, but for this event Aon used an innovative data source to enable faster payments.The catastrophe bond was placed using the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's \"capital at risk\" program, which is used to transfer the risks associated with natural catastrophes to the capital markets, allowing the country to access funds quickly after a major event.\"What you have is a capital provider putting funds in the pool, an insurer putting the coupon for those funds in the pool [and] if the storm hits that criteria, they get the money in a much quicker fashion,\" Aon CFO Edmund Reese told CNBC's Contessa Brewer in an interview.Damaged furniture and debris after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Black River, Jamaica, Oct. 30, 2025. Octavio Jones | ReutersCatastrophe bond and insurance-linked securities were created in the mid 1990s in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's destruction. They've since grown in popularity, with the cat bond market growing by over 50% since the end of 2022 to nearly $55 billion.\"Public-private partnerships like Jamaica's continue to highlight how parametric insurance can deliver rapid, transparent relief in the wake of severe storms,\" Lefferdink said.Jamaica very narrowly missed the requirements necessary to receive a payout from a separate cat bond when Hurricane Beryl battered the island in 2024, resulting in $995 million in damages to homes, crops and infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

Analysts polled by StreetAccount had expected $32.42 billion, or growth of 18.1% from a year earlier. Operating income rose 9% from a year ago to $11.4 billion, also beating estimates and accounting for about two-thirds of Amazon's total operating profit. AWS is the world's top provider of cloud infrastructure, but it's facing intensifying pressure from competitors Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.Google's cloud revenue increased 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.Amazon's earnings report comes a little over a week after AWS experienced an extended outage that lasted more than 15 hours, taking down numerous websites. Microsoft was hit with outages in its Azure cloud and 365 services on Wednesday, hours before its scheduled earnings release.Amazon officially opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier on Wednesday. The facility, first announced last year, is intended to train and run models from Claude creator Anthropic. Amazon, which has invested $8 billion in Anthropic, said the startup will use 1 million of its custom Trainium2 chips by the end of 2025.The new data center could help Amazon battle the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative artificial intelligence deals for cloud services.

    "body": "Reddit CEO Steve Huffman stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) after ringing a bell on the floor setting the share price at $47 in its initial public offering (IPO) on March 21, 2024 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesReddit reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday in which the company beat on the top and bottom and provided strong guidance.Shares were up more than 8% in after-hours trading on Thursday.Here's how the company did compared with LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $585 million vs. $546 million expectedReddit's sales jumped 68% year-over-year in the third quarter, while net income was $163 million, which was $133 million more than the $30 million it logged the previous year during the same period.The company said it expects fourth-quarter sales to come in the range of $655 million to $665 million, ahead of the $638 million that Wall Street was expecting.Reddit said it expects its adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to be between $275 million and $285 million, topping StreetAccount's projections of $259 million.The company said third-quarter global average revenue per user was $5.04, ahead of analyst estimates of $4.82.Third-quarter revenue in the U.S. came in at $480 million, surpassing StreetAccount estimates of $445 million. Reddit generated international third-quarter sales of $105 million, ahead of the $104 million that StreetAccount projected.Reddit's \"Other revenue\" category, which includes the company's data licensing business, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. Google and OpenAI are the some of Reddit's biggest data licensing partners.The company said global daily active uniques for the third quarter grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing analyst estimates of 114 million.Reddit's logged-in DAUq for the U.S., its most lucrative region, rose 7% year-over-year to 23.1 million during the third quarter. That was slower than the 12% year-over-year jump Reddit recorded during the second quarter when logged-in DAUq for the U.S. was 22.9 million. This the fifth quarter in a row in which the company sees its U.S. logged-in user growth slow.The company's third-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 14% year over year to 50.2 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 65.8 million.Investors have been watching for any changes to Reddit's user growth amid Google increasingly debuting generative AI features like AI Overview, which provides summaries to search questions. Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA day after securing a deal for rollback of U.S. tariffs, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Asia-Pacific countries to support free trade, and maintain supply chain stability. \"The more turbulent the times, the more we must work together,\" Xi said in a Chinese state media readout Friday, translated by CNBC. He was speaking at the first session of the Asia Pacific-Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' meeting that runs through Saturday.Xi arrived in South Korea Thursday and met with U.S. President Donald Trump for the first time since 2019.China and U.S. agreed to grant 1-year concessions over tariffs, export controls, and other issues in a relative thawing of relations impacted by tit-for-tat trade measures. U.S. cut tariffs on Chinese goods by 10 percentage points, while Beijing agreed to allow exports of critically needed rare earths.Trump returned to the U.S. Thursday, while Xi stayed on for the summit. In his speech, the Chinese leader reiterated his view that the world was undergoing changes not seen in a century, and emphasized how Beijing was offering global opportunities in the face of growing instability and uncertainties in the Asia-Pacific region.Xi, who did not directly mention the U.S. or tariffs, shared five suggestions for cooperation at the APEC summit: safeguarding the multilateral trading system, creating an open economic environment, maintaining supply chain stability, promoting green and digital trade and fostering inclusive development.He emphasized the need for the countries to join together and \"extend\" the supply chain, rather than disconnecting from each other.That could run up against the U.S. emphasis on reshoring manufacturing, even as Xi highlighted in his meeting with Trump that \"China's development and revitalization goes hand in hand with President Trump's vision to 'Make America Great Again.'\"Over the last two decades, Chinese companies have doubled down on production and the country now accounts for about 27% of global manufacturing net output. As labor costs and tariffs have risen, the Chinese factories have spread to the Asia-Pacific region, while local demand has also grown.watch nowTrump has sought to use tariffs and other policies to encourage companies to bring the factories back to the U.S. New U.S. tariffs announced this year have also sought to reduce transshipments — exports of Chinese goods made through other countries.Since the first round of trade tensions with the U.S. about seven years ago, the Association of Southeast Asian Countries has become China's largest trading partner, surpassing the European Union.China will keep \"opening up\" its market to foreign business, and keep providing new opportunities for Asia Pacific and the world, Xi said Friday.Asia was the top destination for Chinese outbound investment in the third quarter, followed by Africa and Europe, Rhodium Group said in a report Thursday. Chinese companies announced $15.4 billion in investments in Asia during that time, the most since the pandemic, with deals including data centers and battery materials.",

    "body": "A customer shops for Halloween candy at a Walmart Supercenter on October 16, 2024 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesThe scariest thing haunting Halloween this year isn't a ghost, goblin or ghoul — it's the price of chocolate.From Snickers to Reese's to Twix, one of America's favorite indulgences is getting more expensive, as tariffs, inflation and high cocoa prices squeeze profit margins and customers' pocketbooks, possibly leading to fewer chocolate bars landing in trick-or-treat buckets this year.Chocolate prices have surged nearly 30% since last Halloween and almost 78% in the past five years, according to data from research firm Circana and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 100-piece variety bag of candy now costs $16.39, up from $7.20 in 2020, FinanceBuzz found.That spike is showing up on store shelves. Variety packs from Hershey — maker of Reese's, KitKats and Heath bars — are up about 22%, while Mars, the company behind M&M's and Milky Way, raised prices about 12%, according to the Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank, and the Groundwork Collaborative.\"The season did get off to a slow start,\" Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner told investors on an earnings call Thursday, warning that holiday sales could be softer this year.About 4 in 5 Americans buy candy for the Halloween holiday, according to YouGov. This time of year makes up about 18% of annual U.S. confectionery sales — second only to Christmas, according to the National Confectioners Association.But chocolate's dominance is slipping. Circana found it made up 52% of Halloween candy sales last year, compared with 44% this year, as shoppers shift toward cheaper, trendier sweets.\"Macroeconomic headwinds\" are among the culprits, said Sally Wyatt, who works for Circana analyzing global consumer packaged goods and as a food-service industry advisor. \"It's the compounded impact on top of the fact that we've outpaced wage growth. So consumers have started to ... [make] very specific choices on discretionary items.\"Sector-wide, candy prices are outpacing the national inflation rate, marking a roughly 10% increase compared with last year, according to the Century Foundation. Still, the National Retail Federation said 2025 is expected to be a record year for candy sales in the U.S., with about $3.9 billion spent on Halloween candy alone.\"Even as consumers face higher prices for food, they continue to leave room in their budgets for chocolate and candy, meaning that the category is strong, vibrant and growing,\" Carly Schildhaus, a spokesperson for the National Confectioners Association, told CNBC.Much of the chocolate filling U.S. shelves this fall was made from cocoa beans purchased at record prices last December, when futures peaked above $12,000 per ton, experts said. Prices have since cooled to around $6,000, but that's still more than double the pre-pandemic average.A cocktail of rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, drought and crop disease for the past three years has devastated harvests in West Africa, which produces roughly 70% of the world's cocoa. The result: the largest global cocoa deficit in 60 years, with supply falling half a million tons short of demand.Prices could stabilize, but not decrease, by next year as crop yields have increased, said David Branch, a sector manager at Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"It's not just the cost of manufacturing cocoa and other ingredients,\" Branch told CNBC. \"It's also a combination of labor, transportation, fuel, overhead [and] all of those factors, and, given the inflationary rate we've been in, those came up and haven't really come down.\"Hershey said Thursday that tariff expenses will cost the company $160 million to $170 million this year. In July, it also announced a \"low double-digit\" price hike, though executives said those increases weren't tied to tariffs or Halloween pricing.Chocolate makers have lobbied the Trump administration for tariff exemptions on cocoa and other agricultural imports, arguing they have little ability to source those ingredients domestically.Sweet varietyAs chocolate becomes more expensive, fruity, sour and chewy candies have gotten more popular. More than half of shoppers said they planned to prioritize gummy candies for Halloween this year, NielsenIQ found.On average, the price per pound of chocolate rose nearly 14% in the 12 weeks ending Oct. 5, while sales volumes fell 6%, Circana data show. Non-chocolate Halloween candy such as Jolly Ranchers and Skittles saw sales climb 8.3% in that same period.Younger adults, especially Gen Z, are also fueling growth in non-chocolate categories — gravitating toward gummies, freeze-dried sweets and TikTok-friendly flavor mashups.\"It's that experiential [aspect] because you can have it [non-chocolate items] with chewy, with sweet flavors, with hot and sweet, spicy flavors,\" Wyatt told CNBC. \"Some candies you get this big explosion in your mouth of flavors. We've seen it popular with different cohorts.\"Chocolate makers are responding in kind. Hershey has expanded its gummy lineup, including a partnership with Shaquille O'Neal, and rolled out ghost-shaped Twizzlers and mismatched \"Trickies\" Jolly Rancher gummies.Mondelez International, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone, said it's also prioritizing gummies in the U.S. market. CEO Dirk Van de Put said on an earnings call Tuesday, however, that the U.S. market in particular \"is slower than we've seen in quite a while\" and the company's promotional strategy earlier this year \"was not giving us the volume effect that we were hoping for.\"Manufacturers are also experimenting with smaller bars, new fillings and cocoa-free options such as crème or nut-based confections to offset rising ingredient costs, Branch said.\"Companies have got to be very aware of if they can keep their prices in line. They can't just keep increasing their prices and expect sales to continue to go up,\" Branch said. \"But customers have not lost their appetite for chocolate. It's going to remain an indulgence that people will always have and can't really do without.\"",

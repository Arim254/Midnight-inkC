    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLawmakers this week plan to revisit efforts to pass a market structure bill that will determine the crypto industry's future in the U.S. — reviving legislative efforts that stagnated last year.On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to hold hearings on their respective parts of the crypto bill, where they might revise the text. This will lay the groundwork for establishing legislative guardrails for digital assets in the U.S. — a potential watershed moment for the crypto industry. This is what you need to know about the market structure bill and efforts to pass it. The bill's objectiveThe so-called Clarity Act aims to provide legislative guardrails for the multitrillion-dollar crypto market and big digital asset firms — which could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto in the U.S. It seeks to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's and Commodities Futures Trading Commission's roles in regulating cryptocurrencies, in addition to creating more well-defined token classifications. It also aims to outline registration and compliance standards for a wide range of crypto brokerages, exchanges and other entities, enabling them to operate more easily in the U.S. Those guardrails could help the U.S. court more digital assets companies to set up shop stateside, stimulating the economy and boosting the crypto market, according to Summer Mersinger, CEO of crypto trade group Blockchain Association.\"We've seen this massive movement of companies and activity back on shore because there is a friendly administration to crypto,\" Mersinger said. But, without a market structure law, \"that could all go away, especially if there's a change to an unfriendly administration.\"That said, the bill's implications for digital asset companies, crypto holders and other investors won't be 100% clear until the draft legislation's language is finalized. What's happening this weekLawmakers will attempt to hash out three key issues this week: stablecoin-linked rewards; the treatment of decentralized finance platforms and their developers; and the matter of blocking elected officials such as President Donald Trump from profiting off of crypto ventures. Trump-affiliated entities have launched both a memecoin and nonfungible token in the past. The stablecoin issue is \"the biggest outstanding issue\" for negotiations on the Hill, said Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber.\"Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill,\" Carbone said. \"Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.\"In early January, the American Bankers Association's Community Bankers Council wrote to Senate members, asking them to prevent stablecoin issuer affiliates from offering rewards to customers. The stablecoin products, they said, exploit a loophole in the stablecoin-centric Genius Act passed last year that prohibits dollar-pegged tokens that offer yields to holders — which pose an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts and other traditional products. On the DeFi front, crypto advocates are fighting to ensure developers do not face prosecution when their technology is used for illicit activities like money laundering. \"We're very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill… but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn't some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can't comply,\" DeFi Education Fund chief legal officer Amanda Tuminelli told CNBC. DeFi advocates also want to ensure the market structure bill contains language allowing individuals to self-custody their crypto. In addition, they want provisions from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that call for software developers and blockchain service providers who do not control or custody customer funds to be exempt from registering as money-transmitting businesses. Finally, some lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) want to prevent public officials from profiting off of digital asset ventures while they serve. \" It's a really hard issue,\" Mersinger said. \"They ended up kind of punting [on] it in the House because it was really difficult to put on the bill. A lot of Senate Democrats have said, 'We're not going to punt on this issue.'\" 'Key window'The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to put out new drafts of the market structure bill, with the aim of discussing and revising details of the proposed legislation Thursday at markup, according to Mersinger. Later, they will join the two documents to create one big crypto bill. That draft will go to the Senate floor, where discussions could take several weeks, before potentially making its way through the rest of the lawmaking process to become law. Crypto proponents want to see the bill passed before the 2026 midterm elections in case some of the industry's allies are unseated in November and to avoid losing momentum on the Hill, Mersinger told CNBC. \"There's a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year, and so this is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that's needed to get it done,\" Mersinger said. ",

    "body": "Around 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026, new LinkedIn research finds. Filadendron | E+ | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a \"critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,\" as it speeds up processes. \"Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,\" she said. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. \"We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,\" Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. \"The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.\"Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,\" Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. Chamberlin says AI is a \"big part of the solution,\" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. Avoid sending generic applications The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to \"be targeted\" when crafting your resume and cover letter. \"Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,\" she said. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.\"In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,\" she said. \"If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.\"Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.",

    "body": "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a House Homeland Security hearing entitled \"Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.  Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday. \"We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,\" Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot.\"If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,\" Noem claimed in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"This officer was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.\" Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda. The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud.Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, \"Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseDemocrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" demanded an impartial investigation of the incident.\"Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased,\" he said. \"Let's not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice.\" \"When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,\" Frey added.Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions. \"They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,\" Frey said.Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. Frey called for ICE to \"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,\" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\"They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public,\" Noem said on CNN Sunday. \"They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days.\"Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, \"I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears.\"\"I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. I think the 'killing somebody' is the inflammatory element here, not the F-bomb,\" Frey said. On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should \"let the investigation play out.\"\"I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't,\" Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal.This story is developing.

    "body": "Mornings are one of the most underestimated aspects of a relationship. For many working couples, they're something to rush through on the way to the day ahead. Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days.But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. Here's what they do differently that most neglect.1. They resist the urge to rush past each otherYour partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode.That often means making eye contact when saying \"good morning\" or sharing coffee or tea together without distractions. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small \"bids\" for attention that signal recognition and care.Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun.2. They sync before they speakMornings aren't ideal for heavy conversations. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more.The happiest couples understand this intuitively. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines.Even a few moments of silent togetherness can regulate the nervous system and make the day feel more manageable.3. They exchange one honest sentence about how they're feelingRather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings:\"I'm feeling a bit anxious about today.\"\"I'm excited but exhausted.\"\"I'm not fully awake yet.\"They're not revolutionary, but they're necessary for giving context to moods and behavior the other will see later on. It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day.4. They keep one small morning ritual sacredThis could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. The point is for it to be simple enough for you to repeat daily without struggle.Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call \"our thing\" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple.5. They use touch to regulate, not just to say goodbyeIn many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. They use touch intentionally to ground themselves.Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate.6. They treat mornings as a shared system, not a solo sprintMornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load.Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill.7. They send each other into the day feeling supportedBefore parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support:\"Good luck with your presentation today.\"\"You've got this.\"\"Text me if you need a pep talk.\"While they won't change the day's demands, they can make the demands feel easier to manage. More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "A Walmart sign hangs on the exterior of the store on Nov. 20, 2025 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWalmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club.Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with \"Instant Checkout,\" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" Furner said in a news release. \"We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.\"In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is \"rewriting the retail playbook\" and, with AI, it's \"trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.\"Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a \"transformative\" moment.For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI \"helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.\" \"Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,\" he said.Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that \"it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.\"",

    "body": "A Boeing Co. 737 Max airplane at the company's manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington, US, on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoeing is set to report this week that it delivered the most airplanes since 2018 last year after it stabilized its production, the clearest sign of a turnaround yet after years of safety crises and snowballing quality defects. Now, the aerospace giant is planning to ramp up production.\"It's a long road back from a ... shall we say, a rather dysfunctional culture, but they're making big progress,\" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consulting firm.Boeing was forced to scale back production in recent years following two fatal crashes of its popular 737 Max aircraft in 2018 and 2019 and a midair blowout of a door plug from one of its planes in the first week of 2024. The Covid pandemic snarled airplane assembly at both Boeing and its chief rival, Airbus, with supply chain delays and loss of experienced workers, even after the worst of the health crisis subsided.A Boeing 737 approaches San Diego International for a landing, May 10, 2025.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesBoeing's leaders, including CEO Kelly Ortberg — a longtime aerospace executive who came out of retirement to take the top job months after the midair door plug accident — are gearing up to increase production this year of its cash cow 737 Max aircraft and the longer-range 787 Dreamliners.That could help the manufacturer, the top U.S. exporter by value, return to profitability, as analysts expect this year, territory that was out of reach for seven years as its leaders focused on damage control and were stuck reassuring frustrated airline executives who were awaiting late planes.Their tone has changed as Boeing has become more predictable and increased production, with the Federal Aviation Administration's blessing. In a sign of the FAA's increased confidence in Boeing, the agency in September said Boeing could issue its own air worthiness certificates before customers receive some of its 737s and 787s after years of restrictions.Boeing's commercial aircraft business is its largest unit, accounting for about 46% of sales in the first nine months of last year, with the rest coming from its defense and services business. Boeing last reported a full-year profit in 2018.Investors are optimistic for further improvement. Boeing shares have gained 36% over the last 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's nearly 20% advance. \"Boeing is definitely better and more stable,\" said Bob Jordan, CEO of all-Boeing airline Southwest Airlines, in an interview Dec. 10. The company is scheduled to outline its production plans for 2026 later this month when it reports quarterly results on Jan. 27.Getting into gearFor Boeing, the recent turnaround has taken place largely on the assembly floor. Under Ortberg, the manufacturer has slashed so-called traveled work, in which assembly tasks are done out of order, to avoid costly mistakes. The company has made other manufacturing changes, as well, including added training.The National Transportation Safety Board in June said inadequate training and management oversight had been among the problems at the company, according to its investigation into what led to the door plug blowout in January 2024.On Dec. 8, Boeing also completed its acquisition of fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, which Boeing had spun out of the company two decades ago. It now has more direct control of the crucial supplier.Moving out jetsBoeing handed over 537 aircraft in the first 11 months of last year. It reports December deliveries on Tuesday, but Jefferies estimates the company delivered 61 commercial jets last month, 44 of them Boeing's bestseller, the 737 Max.Boeing delivered 348 aircraft in 2024 and 528 in 2023. Last year's total would still be far off the 806 airplanes it handed over in 2018.Last October, the FAA raised its production cap on Boeing's 737 Max from 38 a month to 42. (The FAA required its sign-off after the door plug accident.) CFO Jay Malave said at a UBS conference on Dec. 2 that he expects the company to get to that rate in early 2026. Ortberg told investors in October that further rate increases are on the table, in increments of five planes.Kelly Ortberg, chief executive officer of Boeing Co., during a media event at the Boeing Delivery Center in Seattle, Washington, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHandovers to airlines in 2026 will likely be new production, compared with clearing out older inventory, Malave had said. Boeing is also likely to produce about eight Dreamliners a month as of early this year, he added.Deliveries are key for airplane makers, because airlines and other customers pay the bulk of an airplane's price when they receive the aircraft. Boeing's chief competitor, Airbus, is scheduled to report 2025 orders and deliveries on Monday.Still, several planes that were expected to already flying passengers aren't certified yet, including the Boeing 777X as well as the Max 7 and Max 10 variants, depriving Boeing of cash and driving up costs.Southwest is awaiting the delayed Max 7, the smallest plane of the Max family. The model is important for airline routes that have lower demand so airlines can avoid oversupplying the market with seats, pushing down fares.Southwest CEO Jordan last month said that he doesn't expect the airline to fly the Max 7 before the first half of 2027 as Boeing certification work continues. Boeing at one point expected it to enter service in 2019.\"They're still very short in terms of delivering the aircraft that we need, but I'm glad to see the progress on the Max 7,\" Jordan told CNBC. watch nowRobust demandOrders for both Boeing and Airbus jets look solid, with demand set to continue outstripping supply into the next decade, Bernstein aerospace analyst Douglas Harned said in a note last week.Airbus outpaced Boeing in deliveries last year, though Boeing appears to have outsold its European competitor in new orders.Through November, Boeing logged 1,000 gross orders compared with 797 from Airbus. Airline customers have started to look beyond this decade, snagging delivery slots into the mid-2030s as they plot out growth and international expansions.On Wednesday, Alaska Airlines said it is ordering 105 Boeing 737 Max 10 jets, the longest aircraft of the Max group. Alaska fleet chief Shane Jones told CNBC the order is a sign of \"our confidence in the Max 10 certification\" as well as \"our confidence in Boeing and their turnaround and their ability to produce quality aircraft on time.\"  Alaska also exercised options for five 787 Dreamliners for more international routes just over a year after it acquired Hawaiian Airlines — a combination that handed Alaska more Dreamliners and Airbus A330s to reach for destinations that it couldn't get to before, like Japan, South Korea and Italy.The wide-body aircraft market is now picking up steam, said Ron Epstein, aerospace analyst at Bank of America, with orders starting to get handed over faster to customers.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, he confirmed on Sunday evening.Powell said the probe was the result of the Fed \"setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of\" President Donald Trump.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" he said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.Powell said that on Friday \"the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June,\" \"That testimony concerned in part, a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" he said.\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said.\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" he said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.\"The New York Times first reported the probe, citing officials briefed on the matter.The investigation is being overseen by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the newspaper. That office is led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a former New York state prosecutor and Fox News host, who was appointed to that job by Trump.Trump has repeatedly blasted Powell for the Fed not cutting interest rates as much and as quickly as the president has demanded since entering the White House in January 2025.Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, blasted the investigation of Powell and said that he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, \"until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" the senator said.Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, in a note to clients on Sunday wrote, \"President Trump is trying to bring criminal charges against Powell related to his testimony before Congress about the Fed's headquarters renovation.\"\"Powell may protest by staging a sit-in. His term as Chair is up in May, but his term as a governor isn't up until January 2028,\"Jacobesen wrote.\"With the political pressure on the Fed, he may choose to stay on as a governor out of spite. It would deprive President Trump of the ability to stack the board with another appointee,\" Jacobsen wrote. \"Stephen Miran's term is up in January 2026 and that may be the only vacancy Trump gets to fill. It would be unconventional for Powell to stay on, but everything these days is unconventional.\"This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "The IBM logo at the headquarters of IBM Germany in the Highlight Towers in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria). Mattias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesIn a time of geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some steady portfolio income.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive stocks of companies that generate solid cash flows to support continued dividend payments.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Permian ResourcesWe start this week with Permian Resources (PR), an independent oil and natural gas company with assets in the Permian Basin, with a concentration in the core of the Delaware Basin. At a base dividend of 15 cents per share (an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share), PR stock offers a dividend yield of 4.3%.In a recent research report, Siebert Williams analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price forecast of $19, saying, \"Extending track record of operational execution with a near-term focus on 4Q25, where the implied oil production guidance midpoint is ~187.4 Mbbls/d on a capex of $484.6 mn.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.Sorbara noted that Permian is sticking to its plan to reward shareholders through a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share and opportunistic stock buybacks. Notably, the company has a $1 billion buyback authorization with no end date. The five-star analyst expects Permian to raise its dividend next year and beyond. Meanwhile, Sorbara expects the company to release its 2026 outlook in February once it finalizes a plan that fits the commodity price and service cost backdrop. The analyst expects Permian to benefit from several positives in 2026, including lower drilling costs, an increased production base in the second half of last year, steady operational strength, and better pricing from recent deals. Sorbara expects these tailwinds to drive efficiency in production, capital spending and free cash flow.Additionally, Sorbara noted Permian's efforts to further strengthen its balance sheet, aiming for a long term net-debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) target of 0.5x-1.0x. Also, the $500 million to $1 billion of cash on hand gives the company flexibility to execute capital allocation options like acquisitions, buybacks, and debt reduction even at West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the range of $35 to $40/bbl.Sorbara ranks No. 522 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.4%. See Permian Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.International Business MachinesTech giant IBM (IBM) is this week's second dividend pick. The company returned $1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in the third quarter of 2025. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.2%.Recently, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded IBM stock to buy from hold and raised the price target to $360 from $300, citing \"a clearer path to software acceleration, improving fundamentals, and valuation not yet fully reflecting the software premium.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $354.The five-star analyst noted management's more favorable outlook across key growth areas, with tech transformation and rapid AI adoption fueling broad-based demand. Thill noted that improving regulatory and tax policies, solid organic software growth, synergies from recent mergers and acquisitions and key wins in generative AI consulting are also supporting management's optimism.Notably, synergies from the HashiCorp acquisition and the pending Confluent (CFLT) deal are expected to drive accelerated software growth in 2026 compared to just under 10% exiting 2025. Thill also expects IBM to deliver consistently improving margins (estimates pretax margin of 21% in 2027 compared to 19% in 2025), driven by a growing software mix and operational discipline.With IBM trading at 26x 2027 P/E multiple, compared to the large-cap software peer average of 35x, Thill finds the stock's valuation attractive and contends that it still has upside as the software reacceleration expectation is not priced in.Thill ranks No. 539 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See IBM Statistics on TipRanks. Kinetik HoldingsKinetik Holdings (KNTK) is a midstream energy company focused on the Delaware Basin in the Permian. With a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share (an annualized dividend of $3.12 per share), KNTK stock offers a yield of 8.5%.On Jan. 5, Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins upgraded Kinetik stock to buy from hold with a price target of $46. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating with a price target of $34.\"The stock is down ~38% TTM, and the magnitude of that reset is a core component of our thesis as investor focus shifts toward 2026-27, where operational visibility improves while valuation continues to reflect meaningful skepticism,\" said Jenkins.Jenkins believes that KNTK's risk-reward is getting more attractive, with the earnings outlook for 2026 to 2027 becoming clearer. The improving earnings expectations are backed by more meaningful full-year contributions from the Kings Landing project and better system connectivity as the ECCC pipeline moves toward its Q2 2026 start-up.The analyst's optimism is also backed by its acid-gas injection project, planned for late 2026, which will open access to more sour gas and ease utilization constraints in the Delaware system. Jenkins also expects several macro and operational factors that affected 2025 performance to improve into mid-2026, including Waha price conditions and additional volumes tied to Permian dry gas expansion.Trading at about 8x 2027 EV/EBITDA, at the low end of the midstream peer group valuation range of 8x to 12x, Jenkins finds KNTK stock attractive, with the balance sheet getting stronger after the divestiture of its equity interest in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP. Interestingly, Jenkins sees the possibility of KNTK being a buyout target for midstream companies that want to combine more Permian NGL (natural gas liquids) volumes.Jenkins ranks No. 63 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.1%. See Kinetik Holdings Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 9, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is weighing options to take action against Iran, according to multiple reports on Sunday.The president has been shown potential plans, ranging from possible military strikes to action that doesn't include the military, according to MS Now and other media outlets, citing U.S. officials. Trump aides are set to brief the president Tuesday on measures, including military, cyber and economic, to follow through on his threats, according to reports.  Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran in recent days, warning its leaders against using force against protestors. On Saturday, the president said the U.S. is \"ready to help.\"The White House and U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The discussion of possible intervention comes as Iran's clerical leadership is facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022. More than 500 people have been killed amid a third week of protests and an ongoing economic crisis, according to human rights agencies. Iran's government has intensified its crackdown on protestors, including a reported internet blackout.Iran has been an Islamic Republic since 1979, after the U.S.-backed Shah was deposed by Ayatollah Khomenei. His protégé, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also known as the Supreme Leader, is now in charge. With an inflation rate above 50%, Iran — a country of 92 million people — has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseTrump earlier this week threatened military intervention if Iran moves to crush the protests. Tehran warned on Sunday that it would retaliate against Israeli and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran. Some U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed skepticism about the prospect of the U.S. intervening with Iran.\"I don't think it's the job of the American government to be involved with every freedom movement around the world,\" Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week.\" Paul argued that bombing Iran risks rallying its citizens to the government's side. Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that history shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, arguing the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government triggered a series of events that eventually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the 1970s.Others were more hawkish, arguing it is in the U.S.'s best interests to act.On Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged Trump to \"embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the regime.\"\"If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people,\" he said.This story is developing.

    "body": "watch nowLeading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,\" Woods told Trump at the White House. \"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable.\" Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\"As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,\" Lance told the president. Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. \"We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,\" Nelson told Trump. \"We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. \"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\"",

One is a 1963 Chevrolet K20. The other is a new Silverado EV. The trucks, while part of a temporary holiday display, are symbolic of what's inside the new global offices for the Detroit automaker: its past and present, woven together.GM is occupying four of six office floors of the building and has filled them with artifacts, design nods and \"Easter eggs\" tied to the Detroit automaker's history. They range from a blueprint of GM's iconic design dome and an early map of its nearby proving grounds to an interior wallpaper of 300 patented technologies and a decorative wall of cassette tapes with songs featuring the automaker's brands as well playful references to executive stalwarts such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.One of the centerpiece objects of GM's new headquarters is the McCormick Speed Form, an aerodynamic wind-tunnel model developed at the Warren Technical Center.Courtesy: GM\"Leadership asked when we were helping design the space to bring in some Easter eggs and details to represent who we are at GM, you know, honoring our culture and our history and our innovation,\" Rebecca Waldmeir, GM industrial design architecture and experience manager, told CNBC during a tour of the new headquarters.Other surprises include references to relevant Detroit streets, design influences from GM's famed design campus in suburban Detroit and artwork and sculptures of its products.Aside from the aesthetics, GM officials say the new offices will assist with collaboration and are more relevant to how the company expects its employees to work in a post-pandemic world. It will house executive offices and other corporate functions such as marketing, legal and finance.\"A headquarters really should be, at some level, a beacon for the culture of the company,\" said David Massaron, GM vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. \"When you come in here, it should help people understand who we want to be.\"A wall inside GM's new Detroit headquarters includes cassette tape cases featuring songs referencing the automaker's brands and vehicles as well as custom ones featuring GM executives such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.Michael Wayland | CNBCFrom fortress to functionalityThe new headquarters marks a significant square-foot reduction for the automaker's corporate office — from a towering complex called the Renaissance Center along the city's riverfront to just four floors, roughly 200,000 square feet, in the new building.GM's new HQ is less than a mile from the RenCen, as it's commonly called, which has been a symbol for the city since, ironically, Ford Motor built the complex but decided not to make it its headquarters in the 1970s. GM purchased the building in 1996 as its third headquarters, all of which have been in the Motor City.The RenCen is Detroit's fortress, a 5.6-million-square-foot complex complete with a more-than-700-foot center tower surrounded by four 500-foot towers and two smaller adjacent ones. GM's new headquarters at the Hudson's Detroit development in the city's downtown.Courtesy: GMThe complex is infamously difficult to get in and out of and to navigate. For much of its existence, it was surrounded by concrete barriers before a redesign around the turn of the millennium. It has long been something of a physical permutation of GM's historically siloed culture, which Barra has made a priority to change during her roughly 11-year tenure as CEO.\"The RenCen was designed in a different era, in a pre-Covid era where everybody went to work five days a week, everybody went to their desk,\" Massaron said. \"Particularly, in a post-pandemic world, you need office space that people want to come to, because we have options.\"GM's roughly 50,000 U.S. salaried employees are currently required to work in-office Tuesday through Thursday, but the rules are more flexible than before regarding location and remote working. The Renaissance Center (complex of skyscrapers with the Chrevrolet sign) by the Detroit River.Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMost of the company's new executive offices on the top floor of the building will be open for executives to use as they please, Massaron said. Only four of the offices will be permanently assigned to top GM executives, such as Barra and Reuss, he said.GM declined to disclose how many employees are expected to regularly work at the new headquarters, saying foot traffic will fluctuate based on priorities and workflows. The company also declined to disclose financial details of its 15-year lease at the new headquarters.The building complex, known as Hudson's Detroit, is owned by a real estate company of Rocket Companies chairman and billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been purchasing and renovating properties in Detroit for more than a decade.Showroom, pickleball Aside from the office areas and the executive floor, which all overlook an open atrium, GM also plans to open a semi-public space to display products and host events on the first floor of the building. Other amenities include social gathering areas and lounges, food and beverage services and a pickleball court and recreation area. A common area outside of the executive offices of GM's new headquarters in downtown Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM's new headquarters, which remains under construction, comes months after Ford christened a new 2.1-million-square-foot global HQ and product design and development center in nearby Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's new facility includes offices, design and industrial operations and a host of amenities such as a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts,\" multiple courtyards and other upgrades.The notable difference in the size between GM's and Ford's new headquarters comes down to location, headcount and the automakers' portfolios of offices and operations throughout the region.A pickleball court and seating area inside the building that includes GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM, for example, has a vast technology and design center that occupies 710 acres in nearby Warren, Michigan.

    "body": "watch nowThe booming GLP-1 space was built on weekly injections. In 2026, new obesity pills will push the market into its next chapter.Patients are already getting their hands on the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk — a once-daily drug that shares the same brand name as its popular injection Wegovy. A GLP-1 pill from the company's chief rival Eli Lilly isn't far behind, with a U.S. approval expected within months. For some people, pills may serve as a more convenient — and potentially cheaper — alternative to today's blockbuster injections. The cash prices of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy pill range from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose, which is slightly less than the newly lowered cash prices of injections. While the pills aren't expected to bring more weight loss than weekly shots, based on separate clinical trials, some health experts say expanding the range of treatments could still be a major win for patients.Pills could attract new patients to seek obesity treatment for the first time, expanding the broader weight loss and diabetes drug market and potentially boosting sales for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The new users may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as patients who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.\"I think that there are a lot of people out there who have never tried these GLP-1 drugs and are maybe waiting for the pills to come out,\" said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, medical director of the UC San Diego Health Center for Advanced Weight Management. \"It's kind of a natural preference for some people and even some prescribers.\" \"Secondly, if you have to pay out of pocket, the pills are going to be a bit less expensive than the injections, so that's another reason,\" he said. The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, Nov. 24, 2025. Tom Little | ReutersIt's unclear exactly how many people are currently using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.Now, pills are emerging as the next battleground for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which established the GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth almost $100 billion by the 2030s. In August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills could capture roughly 24% — or about $22 billion — of the global weight-loss drug market by 2030.Here's how obesity pills could reshape the space. Pills could expand the market Oral drugs may pull new patients into the obesity treatment market.\"I believe that this will quite a bit expand the market,\" Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC in late December. \"We know from our own family members and circles of friends that there are many people who still would not rather take an injection ... for this group of people, having a pill option is important.\" Pills could prompt some people to start obesity treatment because \"they think it's somehow more acceptable or approachable\" than an injection, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. watch nowThat doesn't mean a pill will be the best fit for everyone. But once patients enter the health-care system for treatment, doctors can guide them through all options – whether that's an injection, metabolic surgery, or structured diet and exercise programs, Apovian said.UCSD's Grunvald said uptake of obesity pills is likely to be driven by primary care physicians, who treat the majority of eligible patients and may be more comfortable prescribing an oral drug.Grunvald said obesity medicine specialists, who care for only about 5% to 10% of eligible patients, are more likely to continue favoring injections, which appear more effective than pills based on separate clinical trials.Deborah, a 53-year-old librarian in St. Louis, Missouri, said she is curious about the new Wegovy pill in part because of its convenience factor. She declined to provide her last name due to concerns about stigma associated with GLP-1s.Deborah said she would consider an oral GLP-1 because she is already accustomed to taking pills for other prescriptions. She said an oral drug would also bring other benefits, like making travel easier because it won't require refrigeration, like injections do. She said she is also interested in the potentially lower costs of pills. Deborah has been taking weekly injections of Wegovy since June, and was paying $449 per month in cash before Novo Nordisk lowered that price to $349 per month. Pills cost slightly lessCost could be a factor for other patients, too.Novo Nordisk's pill appears to have among the lowest cash prices in the market, at $149 per month for the starting dose and $299 per month for the two highest doses. Eli Lilly's rival pill is expected to have similar pricing for cash-paying patients. Those users will also be able to access the starting dose of both pills for $149 per month through President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal both companies struck with his administration in November. Obesity injections have long been hard for patients to get, due in part to spotty insurance coverage and list prices of roughly $1,000 per month. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have moved to address those concerns by cutting cash prices for their injectable drugs to less than half that amount.A combination image shows an injection pen of Zepbound, Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, and boxes of Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk. Hollie Adams | ReutersEli Lilly in December said the highest doses of single-dose vials of Zepbound will cost $449 per month for cash-paying patients, while Novo Nordisk in November said nearly all doses of Wegovy will cost $349 per month in cash. Those prices are closer to the cost of Novo Nordisk's pill, which may still be expensive for some. But Grunvald said the roughly $150 monthly difference between the highest doses of Zepbound and Novo's pill \"could be a big difference for many people\" willing to pay out of pocket.Patients with insurance coverage for Novo Nordisk's oral drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. But pills likely won't move the needle to boost insurance coverage of GLP-1s for obesity in the U.S. The direct-to-consumer cash prices of Novo Nordisk's oral drug are likely \"significantly less\" than what employers and middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers would pay to cover the drugs, said John Crable, senior vice president of Corporate Synergies, an insurance and employee benefits brokerage and consultancy.Crable said it is unclear how much the pill will ultimately cost payers such as employers since those prices are not publicly disclosed. But if they mirror injection costs — often higher than $1,000 per month — employers may be reluctant to add the drug to their formularies, he said. Some companies that already offer coverage of obesity injections could add the pills this year. But Crable said some employers have actually dropped coverage of GLP-1s for obesity in 2026 due to their high costs.\"I don't see employers being highly motivated to add what is probably going to be another high volume, very high cost drug to their formulary when the direct-to-consumer pricing for it is so much cheaper,\" Crable said. Injections are here to stay Drugmakers have tried to make a case that patients using injections can switch easily to oral drugs. Eli Lilly in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to the company's pill. But Apovian, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, said cost would be the only real reason to move patients who are doing well on injections to a pill.\"If the [cash price] is similar, I always prefer the injectables because I believe that the weight loss is better and the side effects are less,\" she said.Apovian said she wants to see real-world data on how pills perform compared with injections, but separate late-stage trials already offer some clues.Zepbound has shown average weight loss of more than 20% in late-stage studies. That's higher than results seen with both the Wegovy injection and pill as well as Eli Lilly's oral drug in separate trials. In those same studies, about 7% of patients or less stopped treatment due to side effects from the Zepbound and Wegovy injections.The Wegovy pill showed similar discontinuation rates, while about 10.3% of patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly's oral drug stopped treatment because of side effects.Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said patients with obesity who need to lose a larger percentage of their body weight will likely stick with injections, unless they have a fear of needles.Pills, he said, could primarily attract new patients who are overweight or mildly obese and want to achieve only \"modest\" weight loss.Some patients currently using weekly injections may try pills, Risinger added, though not all will find a daily oral option more convenient.That includes Karen Galante, 42, of Horsham, Pennsylvania, who is taking a compounded version of semaglutide – the active ingredient in Wegovy – which she said is priced similarly to Novo Nordisk's new pill.Galante said she does not plan to switch.\"It's hard enough for me to remember to take my vitamins every day,\" she said. \"I like the set-it-and-forget-it of taking one shot a week.\" More than enough room for Novo, LillyRisinger said he expects both pills from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to \"take off like a rocket\" this year. He noted that uptake will be greater for the Wegovy pill initially since Eli Lilly's drug, orforglipron, is likely still months away from entering the market. But Risinger said he believes Eli Lilly's pill will ultimately generate higher sales because patients could consider it more convenient.Eli Lilly's orforglipron is a small-molecule drug that is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's pill, which is a peptide medication. Patients are supposed to drink no more than four ounces of water with the Wegovy pill and must wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything else each day. But Novo Nordisk's CEO Doustdar has argued that those dietary requirements won't hinder uptake. He told CNBC in December it has not been an issue for the more than a million people who are taking the lower-dose version of the pill for diabetes, marketed as Rybelsus, which entered the market in 2019. \"Simply sip and go, and you're going to be fine,\" Doustdar said. \"These people are waking up in the morning and taking their pill with a glass of water, and then they do their normal daily routine half an hour later and move on with their life.\"He also called the company's drug the \"most efficacious pill,\" saying that no other products in development have been able to show its same level of weight loss in a late-stage trial. The highest dose of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy pill helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks in one late-stage study. That's comparable to the injectable form of the drug. There are no head-to-head studies directly comparing that pill with Eli Lilly's. In one of Eli Lilly's late-stage trials, the highest dose of its pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. Despite that difference in efficacy, Risinger said the two pills are viewed as promoting roughly similar levels of weight loss. Some patients may also not need to take the highest dose of either pill, he added. In an August note, Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The analysts said they expect the remaining 19% slice to go to other emerging pills.More competitors emergeOther drugmakers are racing to bring their own oral options to the market, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Risinger highlighted Structure's daily oral GLP-1, which will enter phase three trials later this year. Shares of Structure soared more than 100% on Dec. 9 after it released midstage data showing that its pill, aleniglipron, helped patients with obesity lose more than 11% of their weight at 36 weeks, when adjusted for placebo. Additional trial data showed that a higher dose of the pill could deliver greater efficacy – more than 15% weight loss – surpassing the results seen with the highest dose of Eli Lilly's orforglipron. Still, the tolerability data, or how well patients tolerated Structure's treatment, appeared to be worse than that of Eli Lilly's pill. In a release at the time, Structure CEO Raymond Stevens said the pill could be \"potentially best-in-class\" for an oral small-molecule GLP-1. Risinger said he expects that pill and another oral GLP-1 from AstraZeneca could launch as soon as late 2028. He said potential pills that are taken weekly, as opposed to daily, and have \"compelling profiles could tilt the balance more towards orals\" in the market. Risinger pointed to privately held Verdiva Bio, which is developing several oral peptide treatments designed to be taken once a week. That company has an ongoing phase two trial on an oral GLP-1. ",

    "body": "The Google logo displayed on a smartphone alongside a shopping cart.Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | LightRocket via Getty ImagesAs retailers increasingly turn to artificial intelligence tools to lure shoppers and run key parts of their business, Google wants to make sure it's in the center of the action. At the kickoff of the National Retail Federation's annual show on Sunday, Google announced the launch of what it's calling the Universal Commerce Protocol. The company wants UCP to become an industry standard that retailers use for their AI agents and systems across tasks like discovery, buying and \"post-purchase-support.\"Google says the open-source protocol creates a unified system spanning the shopping experience, from searching to payment, so that retailers don't have to build their own tools and connect the various functions. \"It's very important to have a standardized way so we can scale these things and everyone can be prepared for all the various steps to happen,\" Vidhya Srinivasan, vice president of Google ads and commerce, said in an interview. \"Businesses can pick and choose what they want so there's flexibility for them.\"E-commerce has emerged as one of the major battlegrounds in the booming generative AI market, with Google facing off against OpenAI, Perplexity and Amazon, as they all try and get consumers to use their various apps and services to begin their shopping journey. In September, OpenAI announced Instant Checkout, which allows users to buy some products through ChatGPT, taking a fee from transactions it helps orchestrate. OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe, is open source and could compete with UCP.Perplexity in May said it's partnering with PayPal to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season. And earlier last year, Amazon launched \"Shop Direct,\" a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled \"Buy for Me,\" an AI agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf.By 2030, the retail market could represent a $3 trillion to $5 trillion opportunity globally due to AI-powered tools and agentic commerce, according to a report in October from McKinsey. Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair and Target. The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future. Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols. As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands.\"This is to address the newer consumer behavior which is shifted toward more conversational commerce,\" Srinivasan said. \"We want retailers to be able to connect to users on our surfaces but using their own voice.\"Then there's Google's core market: advertising. Google said it's testing \"Direct Offers,\" which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something. \"Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads,\" Srinivasan said. \"It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers.\"WATCH: Alphabet tops Apple by market capwatch now",

    "body": "Eugene Mymrin | Moment | Getty ImagesAll computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand.That's because companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components. Three primary memory vendors — Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand. \"We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income nearly tripled in the most recent quarter. Samsung this week said that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is considering a U.S. listing as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand for its entire 2026 RAM production capacity. Now, prices for memory are rising. TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\" Three-to-one basisChipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers. Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduces the Rubin GPU and the Vera CPU as he speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 5, 2026. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBut the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\"When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices.\"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said. Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive. In December, Micron said it would discontinue a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers. Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased. Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time. \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday.watch now'Memory wall'AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and Meta.Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.  While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs. \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said. The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\" Erik Isakson | Digitalvision | Getty Images\"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said.More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience. Majestic Labs is designing an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power.Sold out for 2026 Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like Apple and Dell Technologies, how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025. In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\"But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices. \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\"Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products.At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage. Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high.\"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said. At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030.But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said. ",

    "body": "A Home Depot logo is displayed at one of their stores in San Diego, Nov. 8, 2025.Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Wednesday laid off 800 workers and said corporate employees will have to return to the office five days per week.In a message to employees, CEO Ted Decker said the changes are intended to increase the company's \"speed and agility.\"\"To extend our industry-leading position, we must position the company to move faster and stay even more closely connected to our customers and frontline associates,\" he wrote in the memo.A corporate spokesperson confirmed that the company is cutting 800 roles. About 150 of the employees were based at Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta and the rest were in remote jobs, with most in the technology organization of the company and some on other corporate teams, she said.In the employee memo, Decker said the five-day in-office policy will begin the week of April 6. He said the changes are \"essential to simplify our business and focus our energy on the priorities ahead.\"\"In-person engagement enables more meaningful support for store and field associates, drives results and reinforces our people-centric culture and inverted pyramid,\" he said.Home Depot's sales have been weaker than expected, as the retail giant waits for housing turnover and significant home improvement spending to pick up again after a boom in demand during the Covid pandemic. Company leaders have attributed slower demand to higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty and consumers' hesitance to spring for pricier projects.The retailer missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter when it posted results in November. It said that it expects full-year fiscal 2025 sales to rise about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive.Shares of Home Depot have fallen about 10% over the past year, trailing the S&P 500's 15% gains over the same period. So far this year, Home Depot's stock is up about 9%, however, ahead of the S&P 500's nearly 2% gains.Home Depot will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 24.",

Tingshu Wang | ReutersThe U.S. deficit with its global trading partners nearly doubled in November as the shortfall with the European Union swelled and the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs worked their way through the economy, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to $56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by $8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about $1 billion to $13.9 billion.On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at $839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024.The increase in the deficit counters Trump's efforts to use tariffs to reduce imbalances around the globe. When announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the White House used the level of trade deficits with varying countries as a baseline for determining the duties.As the year went by, Trump softened his stance. A framework agreement between the U.S. and the EU in August put the tariff rate at 15% on most European goods and sought to stabilize relations between the two sides.",

Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the automaker is ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, and will use the factory in Fremont, California, to build Optimus humanoid robots. \"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge,\" Musk said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"If you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\"After the original Roadster, the two models are Tesla's oldest vehicles, and in recent years the company has slashed prices as global competition for electric vehicles has soared. Tesla started selling the Model S sedan in 2012, and the Model X SUV three years later. On Tesla's website, the Model S currently starts at about $95,000, while the Model X starts at around $100,000Tesla's far more popular models are the 3 and Y, which accounted for 97% of the company's 1.59 million deliveries last year. The Model 3 now starts at about $37,000, and the Model Y is around $40,000. Tesla debuted more affordable versions of the vehicles late last year. In its earnings announcement on Wednesday, Tesla reported its first annual revenue decline on record, with sales falling in three of the past four quarters. Musk has been trying to turn attention away from traditional EVs and toward a future of driverless cars and humanoid robots, areas where the company currently has virtually no business.A crowd watches and interacts with a Tesla Optimus robot outside the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, U.S., Oct. 27, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersTesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting. The company said in the release that it plans to unveil the third generation of Optimus this quarter, its \"first design meant for mass production.\"Musk said on the call that Tesla is replacing its production line for S and X in Fremont \"with a 1 million unit per year line of Optimus.\"\"Because it is a completely new supply chain,\" Musk said, \"there's really nothing from the existing supply chain that exists in Optimus.\"Tesla expects to boost headcount at the Fremont facility, Musk added, \"and to significantly increase output.\"WATCH: How traders are playing Teslawatch now",

    "body": "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer addresses a business delegation following his arrival to China, at a hotel in Beijing on January 28, 2026.  Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesAfter years of strained ties, China and the U.K. are looking to develop a long-term strategic partnership following a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Starmer is on a 4-day visit to China, the first trip by a British prime minister in eight years — signaling an attempt at resetting relations between the two countries after years of distrust and acrimony.   Beijing's crackdowns on democratic protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and imposition of a sweeping national security legislation in 2020 strained bilateral ties, while U.K. businesses in China have flagged a challenging business climate in the country.  The U.K. has often accused China of conducting espionage in the country, and labeled it as a long-term strategic challenge. Financial Times reported on Tuesday that British officials were planning to tighten scrutiny of Chinese activity over national security concerns. The British government as recently as December moved to clamp down on two tech companies based in China, allegedly for carrying out cyberattacks that it said had undermined U.K. security and prosperity. Against that backdrop, Thursday's developments signal a positive shift in relations. The two countries said they will expand cooperation in key areas including education, healthcare, finance and artificial intelligence research, biological sciences and new energy development, according to a statement published by Chinese state media on Thursday. Beijing will also consider opening visa-free entry for British nationals, the statement said, while urging London to create a fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese firms operating in the U.K. Starmer told Xi at the start of the meeting that it was \"vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship\" allowing both sides to identify areas for further collaborations and dialogue, according to Reuters. London will maintain high-level close communications with Beijing and deepen trade and investment partnerships, according to the Chinese readout. Speaking to reporters following the summit with Xi, Starmer described the meeting as \"positive\" and one that delivered \"productive outcome,\" adding that the relationship was in a \"good, strong place,\" Reuters reported. Turning to China?   Starmer's trip comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy and tariff threats have unsettled traditional allies, while Beijing has hosted several Western leaders just this month including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin — the first visit by an Irish leader in 14 years — and Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.  Xi told Starmer that \"unilateralism, protectionism and power politics have been rampant, severely impacting the international order.\" Xi also urged major economic powers to \"take the lead\" in implementing international laws, \"otherwise they will regress to a jungle-like world.\" That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese statement. Starmer's diplomatic shift appears to mirror that of Canada which signed a trade agreement with China earlier this month following a visit by Carney, as Ottawa appears to diversify trade and investment partners amid persistent frictions with Washington.   On Wednesday, Starmer called on dozens of British business leaders traveling with him to seize opportunities in the world's second largest economy. The U.K. government said in its statement Wednesday that it would pursue a \"strategic and consistent relationship\" with Beijing, seeking to bolster new investment and trade relations while remaining vigilant about potential security threats. Last week, the U.K. government approved plans to open a sprawling Chinese Embassy in London, after the proposal had stalled for years over political and security concerns.   The positive developments come as U.K. businesses in China have been battling a deteriorating business environment for the past six consecutive years, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China. Nearly 60% of the more than 300 British firms surveyed said doing business in the country was harder than it was a year ago, the body said in a report in December. \"Overall business landscape remains complex and often unpredictable,\" it said, citing economic slowdown, regulatory pressures and geopolitical risks. But there have not been strong signs of a broad shift toward withdrawing from the Chinese market, the report said, with many firms continuing to view China as a key market, although they appeared to be more cautious with expansion plans. The U.K., like several other countries, faces a skewed trade relationship with Beijing. Its trade deficit with China ballooned by over 18% year on year to 42 billion pounds ($58.1 billion) in the 12 months ending June 2025, according to the U.K. government data.— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.

    "body": "A Toyota dealership is seen on November 19, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesToyota Motor has retained its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, posting record sales of 10.5 million units, the Japanese auto giant reported on Thursday.  Sales of Toyota and its luxury Lexus marque rose 3.7% from a year earlier, edging out Volkswagen Group's 9 million units and Hyundai Motor Group's 7.27 million units. Notably, demand was buoyed by strong U.S. sales of hybrid vehicles, such as the Prius and RAV4 models. Toyota's strength in the U.S. came despite an aggressive tariff regime rolled out by U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially imposed 25% levies on Japanese automotives, before reducing them to 15%.In the U.S., Toyota and Lexus vehicle sales climbed 7.3% to 2.93 million units. The results reflect success in Toyota's strategy of absorbing tariff-related costs rather than passing them on to consumers through broad price hikes, while focusing on local production and other cost controls.While the company estimated in November that U.S. tariffs would still cost it 1.45 trillion yen ($9.7 billion) in its fiscal year ending March 2026, it also raised its full-year operating profit forecast, citing successful cost reductions and strong demand outside the U.S.Tariffs hit rivalIn another sign of demand for global automotives, Toyota rival Hyundai Motor reported global revenue growth of over 6% in 2025 from a year ago, supported by strong hybrid sales in the U.S.However, its operating profit took a hit from tariffs, falling 19.5% from the previous year, with U.S. levies costing the South Korean automaker 4.1 trillion won.South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a trade deal last year that lowered tariffs on most South Korean products, including cars, to 15% starting in November.However, Trump on Monday threatened to raise the duty back to 25%, saying that the country's legislature had not moved fast enough to implement the deal. Hyundai shares fell by nearly 5% on the news.Hyundai's sales in the U.S. are more reliant on imports, with the company saying in September that only about 40% of U.S. sales were produced domestically in 2025. The company hopes to ramp up local manufacturing at its Georgia facilities to over 80% by 2030.  Toyota — which relied on imports for only about one-fifth of its U.S. sales — has also pursued aggressive U.S. manufacturing expansion, focusing on hybrids.Toyota Motor is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings on Feb. 6. Analysts expect the firm's operating profits to rebound nearly 30% from the same period last year, according to estimates compiled by Reuters.Shares of Toyota popped 3% in trading on Thursday.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is proving to be a star tightrope walker when it comes to balancing its profits, vehicle portfolio and political whiplashing under the Trump administration.The Detroit automaker's 2025 results propelled GM's stock Tuesday to a new record high as the company beat earnings expectations and projected an even better 2026, including a 20% increase in its dividend and a new $6 billion stock buyback authorization.Those kinds of results are nothing new for GM, but Wall Street analysts say the company is drawing more investor interest than its peers amid the U.S. auto industry's slowing sales, political turmoil and tariffs.\"GM stands out for strong execution, proven resilience, high earnings quality (i.e. strong [free cash flow] amid inventory de-stock), capital allocation and a unique NA Truck Franchise sporting far better fundamentals vs. traditional passenger auto,\" TD Cowen analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a Tuesday investor note.Shares of GM are up more than 70% during the past year, with multiple Wall Street analysts raising their price targets to record levels after earnings, including TD Cowen, which raised its target Tuesday by 10% to $122 per share.GM is also increasingly standing out from its closest U.S. rivals Ford Motor and Stellantis when it comes to earnings performance and capital execution, according to many analysts.\"We rate GM Overweight for its best-in-class execution amongst North America–based auto OEMs, consistent management team and strategy, and strong product portfolio allowing for above-industry pricing and margin,\" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a Tuesday investor note.Ford's shares are up more than 35% during the past year, but its adjusted earnings forecast for the year is roughly half of what GM reported for 2025. Its adjusted free cash flow expectations also are billions below GM's in recent years.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM, Ford and Stellantis stocksU.S.-listed shares of Stellantis, which is going through a major restructuring,  are off roughly 27% over the past year. The company's results have largely disappointed Wall Street recently, as it attempts to focus on a U.S. turnaround.GM's 2025 results included results included $2.7 billion in net income attributable to stockholders, or earnings per share of $3.27; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $12.7 billion, or $10.60 per share; and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10.6 billion.Staying on the ropePart of what's set GM apart has been its ability to navigate through political uncertainty under U.S. President Donald Trump.The biggest challenge for the automotive industry as a whole has been increased costs due to tariffs and inflation. GM expects tariffs will cost it $3.5 billion and inflation will be a $1.25 billion, at the midpoints, in 2026.But GM plans to mitigate some of that. The automaker expects to offset those costs with $500 million to $750 million in regulatory savings under Trump policies, narrower EV losses of $1 billion to $1.5 billion from lower production, and billions of dollars in other benefits such as pricing and warranty expenses.\"For '26, commodity and onshoring headwinds could be offset by regulatory benefits, warranty improvements, narrowing EV losses, and lower tariffs resulting from USMCA negotiations,\" RBC Capital analyst Tom Narayan said in a Tuesday investor note.GMC SUVs parked outside a GMC Buick dealership in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, on March 22, 2025.Artur Widak | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMore broadly, the automaker's EV retreat, including $7.9 billion in write-downs last year, means it's going to continue to sell more profitable traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines.And GM can now produce as many gas-guzzling vehicles as the company would like without federal penalties, which were eliminated by the Trump administration. It will also save billions of dollars on purchasing credits to offset such penalties.GM CFO Paul Jacobson said on a call with investors Tuesday that no matter what changes come to the auto industry, GM's success depends on its ability to adapt to new environments and the probability of its vehicles.\"In the face of a rapidly evolving industry and significant macro challenges, the resilience and adaptability of the GM team have been truly exceptional,\" he said.Cash is kingGM's balancing act is easier when it can fall, if needed, onto piles of cash. Jacobson on Tuesday noted the company had more than $20 billion to end last year, referring to its $12.7 billion of EBIT-adjusted earnings and $10.6 billion of adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2025.The Detroit automaker has been able to increase its average annual free cash flow generation from $3 billion to $10 billion over the past five years. \"This robust cash generation enables us to execute confidently across all pillars of our capital allocation framework,\" Jacobson said. \"Looking ahead to 2026 and 2027, we expect to invest $10 billion to $12 billion annually, including approximately $5 billion to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity for some of the highest demand vehicles and further reduce our tariff exposure.\"That cash flow has been in addition to returning $23 billion back to shareholders through repurchases since November 2023. That has helped boost the company's stock price by eliminating more than 465 million shares, or nearly 35%, of its outstanding shares that are now at about 930 million.GM was among the first major automakers to report its fourth-quarter and 2025 earnings. Its performance puts pressure on others to prove their tight-walking ability as well.\"We think it's important to remember this is a very different business today vs. the GM of a decade ago, with a much more resilient earnings profile than appreciated, and a more balanced and pragmatic approach to investment. GM seems on track to return to the same robust earnings level achieved in recent years, even with tariff costs in its cost structure,\" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a Wednesday investor note.GM also alluded to its costs and earnings continuing to improve post-2026 as it continues to realign its lineup, improve costs and onshore more production to the U.S.GM's 2026 earnings guidance includes net income attributable to stockholders of between $10.3 billion and $11.7 billion; adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $13 billion to $15 billion; and earnings per share of between $11 and $13 for the year.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowStarbucks is reintroducing tiers to its North American loyalty program in a bid to encourage coffee drinkers to visit more frequently as part of its broader turnaround strategy.The company made the announcement on Thursday at its investor day. Executives across the business are sharing more details on Starbucks' plans to drive future sales growth and profitability, including through its all-important loyalty program.Starbucks Rewards has existed since 2009. The company, long seen as a leader in restaurant technology, relies on its loyalty program to encourage members to visit more frequently and spend more money. In fiscal 2025, the transactions linked to the Rewards program accounted for 60% of the company's revenue.But the coffee chain also has to balance offering members enticing rewards with maintaining profit margins. In 2019, the company eliminated the two-tiered system, saying that the change was meant to encourage new members to become more engaged. The company now feels that system does not appropriately reward its most loyal customers.\"Our very best customers are coming 200 times a year, and we were treating them the same as someone who comes once a year,\" Starbucks Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman, who joined the company in November 2024, told CNBC's Kate Rogers. \"So we've introduced tiers.\"The tiered program will return on March 10, this time with three levels.How Starbucks loyalty tiers will workStarbucks Rewards members with fewer than 500 \"stars\" — or points — will belong to the green tier. They can enjoy a free drink or food item on their birthday, receive early access to select menu items and get personalized offers. Green-tier members' stars won't expire for six months, and they can keep them from expiring in several ways, like redeeming a reward or making a purchase.Once a customer earns 500 stars over a 12-month period, Starbucks upgrades them to the gold tier. Their points never expire, and they earn 1.2 stars for every dollar they spend.Members can level up to reserve tier after earning 2,500 stars over a 12-month period. Customers at this level get access to exclusive merchandise and events, and they earn 1.7 points per dollar spent.The current Starbucks Rewards program gives members two stars for every dollar they spend when they pay with a preloaded Starbucks gift card. If they pay with a credit or debit card, members earn just one star per dollar spent.The rewards available for redemption are largely staying the same, although Starbucks is adding the option for a $2 discount on any order in exchange for 60 stars. The company is also adding \"Free Mod Mondays,\" which give loyalty program members a complimentary modification to any drink on a select Monday, once per month.The announcement comes on the heels of the company releasing its earnings report on Wednesday morning. For the first time in nearly four years, Starbucks saw traffic from both Rewards members and nonmembers grow during the quarter. \"You have to win both with your Rewards customers and — call it — the light or infrequent customer,\" CEO Brian Niccol said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday.",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is followed by reporters as he walks to the Senate Chambers in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 27, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesRepublican senators appear to be opening the door to preventing a partial government shutdown as the chamber prepares to start voting on a House-passed package to fully fund a group of federal agencies through the remaining fiscal year. The Senate is set to start voting on the funding bills Thursday morning. If the chamber doesn't pass all of them, much of the federal government would shut down Saturday at 12:01 ET.The bills would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, including the Treasury and Defense departments. While the package once looked certain to clear the Senate and avoid a shutdown, the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents Saturday in Minneapolis derailed it. Democrats are demanding that the DHS portion of the bill be stripped from the package and weighed separately to make changes to how the agency operates, a move that Republicans have so far resisted. On Wednesday, some Senate Republicans began to embrace the idea of splitting off DHS, as a shutdown looms just months after a record 43-day closure last year. The measure will require 60 votes to clear the Senate filibuster. Republicans hold only 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats can block it if they withhold their votes.\"Rather than scuttling the whole package, I say let's go and pass what we can,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said in an interview with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday. \"I think all the bills will pass except Homeland Security, and then we can sit down and talk about Homeland Security,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Asked how many of his Republican colleagues support such a move, Kennedy said: \"A bunch.\"Indeed, numerous Republicans said Wednesday that while they would like to see the entire package pass the Senate, splitting off DHS is a palatable off-ramp. \"We are going to see what happens when that vote comes up,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., another member of the appropriations committee. \"[But] if the Democrats block it, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has already said that he's willing to move the five, and so I certainly have an open mind on that.\"Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC that if Democrats are \"okay with five of the six bills,\" then \"we ought to figure out a way to get those done.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a press conference Wednesday that such proposals are so far \"hypotheticals\" and that he would \"reserve optionality.\" \"I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact,\" Thune said. \"If there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let's do that.\"Democrats are warning that a separate negotiation with the administration would not be enough to assuage their concerns. President Donald Trump has attempted a turnabout in recent days after the fallout from the shooting of Pretti in Minnesota, recently saying he will deescalate his immigration crackdown in the state. \"This has to be in the bill,\" said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don't think we could settle for promises.\" King repeatedly voted to reopen the government during the last shutdown, bucking his caucus. \"I can't in good conscience vote for a DHS budget under these circumstances,\" King said, calling for the DHS component to be separated so the rest of the bills can pass. DHS is conducting immigration operations in Maine. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, arrives for a vote in the Capitol on Thursday, September 28, 2023.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSchumer, D-N.Y., listed Democrats' demands in a press conference Wednesday. He said Democrats want a DHS funding package to include new guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Those guardrails include a requirement for warrants for arrests, a ban on federal agents wearing masks, mandatory body cameras and a uniform code of conduct for federal agents. \"Democrats stand ready today to pass the five bipartisan bills in the Senate, but the DHS bill needs serious work,\" Schumer said. \"It's now on Leader Thune to separate out the DHS bill ... and start working with Democrats to rein in ICE.\"Republicans appear to be plowing ahead with plans to vote on all six bills. \"We're voting on this tomorrow,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"Anything can change in 24 hours, but our plan is to vote on six bills.\" Should that vote fail and Senate Republicans decide to split off the DHS portion, it would likely require a unanimous consent request on the Senate floor to alter the bill, given the short timeline. Any one senator could object to such a move, drawing out the timeline and further risking a shutdown. \"I've got concerns with that, but I'd have to examine it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, when asked by CNBC if he would object to stripping out the DHS bill from the package. Republicans also note that a shutdown at DHS would also mean that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would go unfunded during a winter cold snap that has brought bitter temperatures, ice and snow to a large part of the country. King suggested that a short-term continuing resolution could keep FEMA and other agencies afloat. Any changes the Senate makes to the package would also require reapproval by the House. The House is out of Washington on recess, with plans to return next week — after the shutdown deadline. \"If the bill changes much from what the House already passed, then you've got another steep hill to climb over there,\" Thune said. DHS would largely also be able to keep operating its immigration enforcement apparatus even if it enters into a shutdown. Republicans gave the agency hundreds of billions of dollars in supplemental appropriations as part of the tax and spending package passed last year.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct day of the shutdown.",

Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the fund is currently an investor in more than 7,000 companies across 60 countries.Its most valuable investments include a 1.3% stake in Nvidia, a 1.2% stake in Apple and a 1.3% stake in Microsoft. \"Stocks in technology, financials and basic materials stood out, making a significant contribution to the overall return\", Nicolai Tangen, NBIM's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.NBIM's holdings in the basic materials sector include mining giant Fresnillo — the best-performing stock on London's FTSE 100 last year, which surged 452.5% amid a silver boom and its acquisition of Probe Gold.In the financial sector, NBIM holds significant stakes in Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The fund also has various holdings in global lenders, including European banking giants Santander, UBS, HSBC and UniCredit. Europe's banking sector has been a source of major returns for investors in recent years.Outside equities, NBIM's fixed income investments returned 5.4% in 2025, while unlisted real estate returned 4.4%. Its renewable energy infrastructure holdings returned 18.1% last year.

And I think that's the best way for a very long-term fund,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Correction: The headline and text of this article have been updated to correct a conversion error when reporting the fund's return in US dollars.",

    "body": "Comcast posted mixed results for its fourth quarter on Thursday, beating analyst expectations on earnings but slightly missing on revenue. Once again, Comcast's broadband business showed signs of significant competition facing cable companies. Comcast said it lost 181,000 domestic broadband customers during the period, although it said the losses were offset by an increase in international subscribers. The company's mobile offering remained a bright spot, notching 364,000 additions during the period and bringing its total to more than 9.3 million mobile customers for Comcast's newest business. Last year, Comcast said it was shifting its strategy to focus more on growing its mobile business after facing continued pressure in broadband, mainly due to competition from wireless providers like Verizon and T-Mobile. \"The competitive environment for broadband remains intense, similar to prior quarters, but we saw wireless competition step up towards the end of the fourth quarter,\" said Comcast CFO Jason Armstrong during Thursday's call with investors. \"Against that backdrop, we continue to advance our new go-to-market strategy we launched earlier this year.\" Here's how Comcast performed in the period ended Dec. 31 compared with average analyst estimates, according to LSEG: Earnings per share: 84 cents adjusted vs. 75 cents expectedRevenue: $32.31 billion vs. $32.35 billion expected Net income attributable to Comcast decreased 54.6% to $2.17 billion, or 60 cents per share, compared with $4.78 billion, or $1.24 per share a year earlier. Adjusting for certain one-time items — like the value of intangible assets, charges associated with investments and prior-year tax benefits that Comcast said made for an \"unfavorable comparison\" — the company reported adjusted net income of $3.06 billion, or 84 cents per share. Comcast's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were down 10% to $7.9 billion. The company's overall quarterly revenue was up more than 1% to $32.31 billion. Revenue for Comcast's connectivity and platforms unit – which includes its Xfinity-branded services across broadband, pay TV and mobile – was down 1% to $20.24 billion. In particular, revenue fell 1% for the domestic broadband unit to roughly $6.32 billion. While this reflected the decrease in broadband customers, it was partially offset by higher average rates, Comcast said. In addition to the broadband customer losses and mobile additions, Comcast lost 245,000 pay TV customers during the fourth quarter. The company now has 11.27 million total pay TV customers. Meanwhile, revenue for the company's media unit, which includes NBCUniversal, rose 5.5% to $7.62 billion. This marks the final quarter that NBCUniversal's earnings report includes its full portfolio of cable networks, as Comcast spun out most of its pay TV networks, including CNBC and MS Now, into the publicly traded entity Versant. Domestic advertising revenue for the media business was up 1.5% due to the addition of the NBA on NBC, which helped propel overall revenue.  NBC's streaming service, Peacock, added 3 million paid customers after three quarters of essentially no change. It ended the year with 44 million paid subscribers. The streaming service reported losses of $552 million for the fourth quarter, wider than the $372 million in losses it recorded in the prior year period.Those losses were due in part to the impact of the NBA rights deal which began during the quarter. Peacock saw $1.6 billion in revenue compared with $1.3 billion the year-ago quarter.Comcast's Universal film studio revenue was down 7.4% to $3.03 billion due to a drop in licensing and theatrical revenue when compared with the prior-year quarter. The releases of \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Black Phone 2\" fell short of last year's \"Wicked\" and \"The Bad Robot.\"Universal theme parks revenue, however, was up 22% to roughly $2.9 billion, driven by last year's opening of Epic Universe.Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of CNBC. Comcast was the parent company of CNBC through the fourth quarter of 2025. ",

    "body": "ServiceNow Inc. signage during the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, on March 20, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSoftware stocks on Thursday slid deeper into an ongoing intense sell-off  this year as investors recoiled from the sector on growing fears that artificial intelligence could upend many firms' business models. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped about 5% in morning trading, on pace for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 21% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries.Month to date, IGV is down almost 14%, on pace for worst month since October 2008 when the fund fell 23%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF over one yearThe concern about the AI threat outweighed solid earnings from bellwether names like ServiceNow, whose shares plunged more than 11% Thursday. The enterprise software maker topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations and issued better-than-expected guidance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconServiceNow 5 days\"Good, but not good enough,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note of ServiceNow report. \"In an environment of heightened investor skepticism on incumbent application vendors, stable growth, in line with expectations, likely falls short of shifting the narrative.\"The pressure has deepened across the sector as investors question whether AI competitors and automation tools could erode demand for traditional software licenses and workflows. Valuations once justified by steady subscription growth are being recast as investors assess the possibility that AI could permanently shrink long-term revenue potential.The selloff spilled into megacap tech as well. Microsoft slid about 10% after reporting a slowdown in cloud growth for the fiscal second quarter, on track for its steepest one-day drop since March 2020. The software giant also issued softer-than-expected guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.Investor unease has been amplified by the rapid pace of AI development itself. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 late last year, its third major model launch in just two months. The company said the model excels at coding, operating computers and assisting with complex enterprise tasks, with ideal users including professional software developers and knowledge workers such as financial analysts, consultants and accountants.ServiceNow Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott sought to counter investor fears on the company's earnings call Thursday, saying concerns that AI will displace software vendors are misplaced. \"The real payoff comes when trillions of tokens move beyond pilots to be embedded directly into the workflows where business decisions are made,\" McDermott said. \"ServiceNow is the gateway to this shift, serving as the semantic layer that makes AI ubiquitous in the enterprise.\"He added that because AI systems are probabilistic, companies still need workflow software to ensure consistent business outcomes.— With assistance from CNBC's Samantha Subin.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 28, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Federal Reserve wrapped up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, delivering pretty much what the market expected and no major surprises from Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Here are five things worth remembering:The decision: To no one's surprise, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark funds rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. The move broke a string of three straight cuts and could be a harbinger of a central bank not of a mind to ease again anytime soon.The dissents: As has been the custom for the past six months or so, multiple committee members broke ranks. This time, Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller wanted another quarter percentage point cut. For Miran, though, it represented a bit of a turn as he deviated from three prior dissents in favor of half-point reductions.Powell's post-meeting news conference was, in a word, a snoozer. On five separate occasions, the chair delivered variations on \"I have nothing for you on that\" to questions from reporters looking to bait him into commenting on the multiple political kerfuffles surrounding the Fed. Asked for the advice he would give his successor, Powell responded,  \"Stay out of elected politics.\"From an economic standpoint, the FOMC statement and Powell's commentary reflected expectations for solid growth, a near-term tariff-fueled boost for inflation that ultimately will recede, and a labor market in stasis as the labor force participation rate plus less immigration keep hiring in check while layoffs are also muted.And the markets yawned. With little to go on, the major stock averages closed little changed. Traders are still pricing in about a 60% chance of two additional, quarter percentage point rate cuts this year. What they're saying\"The Fed delivered a rate cut, but it arrived in a somewhat hawkish package. The Fed hasn't shut the door on further cuts, but Chair Powell has raised the bar for further action. We expect the economy to grow at a solid pace next year, but it must be accompanied by job gains. The next round of jobs data may point to the exact opposite.\" — Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\"It's détente at the Fed for now. But a shakeup is coming with the new Fed Chair in May.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"Perspectively speaking, we saw this meeting as an affirmation from the Fed of what investors were already thinking. Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated and inflation has steadied for now. To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it's time for a long pause.\" — Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.watch now",

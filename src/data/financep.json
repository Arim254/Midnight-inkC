Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA Rhode Island federal judge was asked Tuesday to force the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, a day after the administration said that it would pay only half of the costs of those food stamps for November.Lawyers in a court filing said that the administration's decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet Judge Jack McConnell's prior order that any decision to make partial payments \"cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\"About 42 million Americans receive food stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.McConnell had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least  $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.

REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File PhotoRemo Casilli | ReutersLuxury carmaker Ferrari on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, with net revenues jumping more than 7% compared to the same period last year.The Maranello, Italy-based sports car manufacturer posted net profit of 382 million euros ($439.5 million) for the July-September period, reflecting a nearly 2% increase from the same period last year.Analysts had expected first-quarter net profit to come in at 367.33 million euros, according to an LSEG compiled consensus.Ferrari's third-quarter net revenues came in at 1.77 billion euros, up 7.4% compared to the same period a year ago, with total shipments of 3,401 units.\"We continue to advance with conviction and strong visibility on our development path,\" Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said in a statement.\"At our Capital Markets Day, we have defined a clear trajectory in the long-term interests of our brand, setting the floor for sustainable growth toward 2030,\" he added.Ferrari also reaffirmed its 2025 profit guidance, which had been revised upwards during its Capital Markets Day event on Oct. 9.The automaker said it expects net revenues of at least 7.1 billion euros this year, up from a previous forecast of more than 7 billion euros. It cited a stronger product mix and personalizations, as well as lower-than-expected industrial costs in the second half of the year.The results come shortly after Ferrari notched its worst-ever trading day. The firm's share price tumbled 15.4% on Oct. 9, closing at 354 euros, as its 2030 guidance fell short of analyst expectations.The stock price fall marked the automaker's steepest daily loss since it publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.",

    "body": "Independent candidate former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani participate in a mayoral debate, in New York, U.S. October 16, 2025.Angelina Katsanis | Via ReutersNew York City voters will elect a new mayor on Tuesday, as two well-known Big Apple names strive to beat a relative newcomer, Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist whose sudden political ascendance has drawn attention nationwide.Mamdani, the Democratic Party nominee, is facing off against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a longtime Democrat running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of Guardian Angels.The winner will replace New York's scandal-plagued mayor, Eric Adams, who dropped out of the contest in late September.Mamdani, a state Assemblyman now in his third term, defeated the 67-year-old Cuomo in a stunning upset in June's Democratic ranked-choice primary.Polls for the general election have consistently shown Mamdani leading the race.Mamdani, a native of Uganda who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, has called for a freeze in the rent of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, free public buses and the creation of city-owned grocery stores.His platform and political worldview have sparked a backlash from city billionaires and other business interests, with anti-Mamdani political action committees raising more than $40 million to oppose his candidacy and back Cuomo.Cuomo, who previously was U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as well as New York state attorney general, resigned as governor in August 2021 after being accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.Cuomo, whose father, Mario Cuomo, served three terms as the state's governor, has denied wrongdoing.His campaign platform calls for increasing the size of the city's police department, deploying more officers in the city's subways, building more affordable housing and reducing school class size.The former radio host Sliwa, 71, in his second campaign for mayor, has leaned heavily on issues surrounding public safety, and called for hiring 7,000 additional police officers.Read more CNBC politics coverageNYC mayoral election: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa fight to replace Adams as Trump weighs inNJ governor election: Sherrill and Ciattarelli face off in close race as Trump, Obama weigh inVirginia governor election: Spanberger and Earle-Sears vie to succeed YoungkinSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsAdams also had been running as an independent after skipping his Democratic Party's primary.Adams' public approval ratings had plummeted after his indictment in 2024 on federal corruption charges, which were later dismissed by a judge at the behest of the Department of Justice following the return of President Donald Trump to the White House.Adams last month endorsed Cuomo, whom he had recently called a \"snake and a liar.\"Since Adams' withdrawal, Sliwa has faced intensifying pressure to quit the race to boost Cuomo's chances against Mamdani.Among those calling for Sliwa to drop out has been his fellow Republican, Trump, who has repeatedly and inaccurately claimed that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"This is developing news.

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersNorway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting this week, rebelling against management guidance and threats from Musk to step down if the deal is rejected.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund — the largest of its kind in the world, and a major shareholder in Tesla — said on Tuesday that it had already cast its vote against Musk's remuneration package as CEO of the carmaker.\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" NBIM said in a statement.\"We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\" the fund's managers added.Norway's wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, according to its half-year filings in June. The value of that investment was last declared to be 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion).Tesla shares were 2.5% lower in premarket trade.Tesla's Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve a pay plan for Musk that could see him granted almost $1 trillion in stock and expand his voting powers at the company. The full award would be contingent on Tesla hitting certain milestones over the next 10 years.The proposals have raised eyebrows and been met with opposition from some company watchers. Last month, the Take Back Tesla campaign — a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs — urged shareholders to reject the deal, while proxy advisories Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended investors vote against the compensation package.Musk has hit back at those recommendations, labeling ISS and Glass Lewis \"corporate terrorists\" on an analyst call.\"Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,\" Musk wrote in a post on X last month in response to a critic of the pay proposal. \"Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won't be me.\"Representatives for Musk and Tesla were not immediately available to comment on NBIM's vote against the proposed CEO compensation package.However, Musk has butted heads with NBIM over his pay in the past.Last year, NBIM voted against reinstating Musk's $56 billion pay deal after it was rescinded by a U.S. judge. The package — the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history — was ultimately approved by Tesla's shareholders.Following the vote, the Financial Times and Norwegian newspaper E24 published text messages exchanged between Musk and NBIM Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen, which showed the Tesla CEO declining an invitation to a dinner in Norwegian capital Oslo.\"When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends,\" Musk reportedly wrote. \"Friends are as friends do.\"Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $504.1 billion.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Rent payments have become a consideration on a growing number of American credit reports.The share of consumers whose rent payments were reported to credit bureaus rose to 13% in 2025, up from 11% in 2024, according to a recent report from TransUnion, one of three major bureaus.For many in the credit industry, the uptick is a net positive. Advocates for rent reporting, from nonprofits to members of Congress, have touted it as a way for those with thin or non-existent credit files to start building or boosting their creditworthiness.\"It's a good thing that more people's rent payments are getting reported to credit bureaus because it can really help people improve their credit,\" Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, recently told CNBC.But he and other experts say that certain consumers should tread carefully. That's because, for certain renters, the risk of reporting a missed or late payment can render these programs' benefits moot.\"Those late payments show up on [your credit report], and it's like the kiss of death for landlords,\" says Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.It's common practice for landlords to examine your credit history when considering whether or not to rent to you, Wu says. And while some may be willing to look past a late credit card payment, \"they're not looking past a late rent payment,\" she says. \"What you risk is hampering struggling tenants or even causing them to be homeless.\"Approach rent reporting with cautionFor consumers who consistently make on-time payments, rent reporting programs are doing their job. Including rent in credit reporting increases enrollees' scores by an average of 60 points, according to a 2021 report from TransUnion.But for the most vulnerable renters — those who these programs are ostensibly aimed to help — the risks can outweigh the benefits, says Wu.\"A landlord seeing a 30-day late [payment], at a minimum, is going to require a high security deposit, might turn them down, and that tenant might not be able to find a decent apartment ... or might not be able to get an apartment at all,\" she says.If you've had spotty history making rent, or even if you fear that an emergency, such as a job loss, could affect your ability to make on-time payments, these programs likely aren't for you, experts say.Your rent may already be on your reportAvoiding having your rent reported may not be as simple as choosing not to sign up for one of these programs. Your landlord or property manager may be reporting your rent payments on your behalf, Wu says.\"Some of these programs are opt-out. Some of them are automatic, and they don't let you opt out,\" Wu says. \"The worst ones are when a landlord — usually a big corporate landlord — is doing rent reporting so that they have a stick over tenants.\"NCLC has investigated cases in which landlords used rent reporting as a \"cudgel\" against tenants legally withholding rent due to substandard living conditions.If you're concerned that your rent payment information is being reported without your knowledge, check your credit reports, says Wu. You can request free reports from each of the three major bureaus at AnnualCreditReport.com.It's also worth reviewing your lease or rental agreement and checking with your landlord or property manager regarding the policy around reporting missed payments, according to Experian.Be especially wary if a rent-reporting program is a so-called \"full-file\" reporter, meaning that both on-time and missed payments go on your report, says Wu. Some services provide what's known as \"positive only\" reporting, which only includes payments that will help your score.   While those are less risky, Wu says, they can still potentially ding your standing with future landlords if they see a gap in your on-time payments. Whether or not you share that information should be an informed decision, Wu says.\"Consumers should have a choice whether their information is supplied or not,\" she says. \"One of the biggest overall problems in the credit reporting system is, we have no choice.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A small replica of the Charging Bull statue is seen on a street vendor stall outside the New York Stock Exchange on July 11, 2025.Jeenah Moon | ReutersGlobal markets may be due for a reality check after this year's relentless rally, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday cautioned investors to brace for a drawdown over the next two years.Equities worldwide have been soaring, hitting record highs this year, driven by AI-linked gains and expectations of rate cuts. Over the past month, key U.S. indexes have scaled new peaks, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit fresh highs, while China's Shanghai Composite has notched its strongest level in a decade on easing U.S-China tensions and a softer dollar. \"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. \"Things run, and then they pull back so people can reassess.\"However, Solomon noted that such reversals were a normal feature of long-term bull markets, noting that the investment bank's standing advice to clients remains to stay invested and review portfolio allocation, not attempt to time markets.\"A 10 to 15% drawdown happens often, even through positive market cycles,\" he said. \"It's not something that changes your fundamental, your structural belief as to how you want to allocate capital.\"Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, speaking at the same panel, said investors should welcome periodic pullbacks, calling them healthy developments rather than signs of crisis.\"We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,\" he said.Solomon and Pick's views come on the back of recent warnings by the IMF of a possible sharp correction, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have also cautioned about inflated stock valuations.Bright spots in AsiaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pointed to Asia as a bright spot in the next few years on the back of recent developments including the trade pact between the U.S. and China. Goldman expects global capital allocators to continue to be interested in China, adding that it remains one of the \"largest and most important economies\" in the world.Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Hong Kong, China, Japan and India due to their unique growth stories. Japan's corporate-governance reforms and India's infrastructure build-out were singled out as multi-year investment themes.\"It's hard not to be excited about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India — three vastly different narratives, but all part of a global Asia story,\" Ted said. He highlighted the AI, EV and biotech sectors in China particularly.",

    "body": "Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Lisa Cook speaks on \"The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\" at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 3, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in her first policy speech since President Donald Trump tried to remove her from office, said Monday that she supported the recent interest rate reduction and indicated she would be open to more.Since Trump made his move in August to sack Cook on accusations of mortgage fraud, she has kept a relatively low profile outside of the court battles that have kept her in her position at the central bank.In remarks before the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., the policymaker laid out her views on the economy and where she thinks monetary policy should land. Generally, she sees the economy as solid with risks to both the Fed's goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.Cook said she sided with the 10-2 vote on the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the second meeting in a row that saw a cut.\"I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization,\" she said.Trump has been blocked by courts from removing Cook in what has been seen as a pivotal issue for central bank independence. Though White House officials have said Cook lied in forms she filled out for federally guaranteed home mortgages, she has not been convicted of anything nor have any charges even been brought. Cook has cited \"clerical errors\" in the loan applications. She declined to comment on the matter during a question-and-answer session, saying \"it would be inappropriate\" while noting she is \"beyond grateful\" for the support she has received.In the meantime, she has continued her duties at the Fed, which lowered its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December.As for the path going forward, Cook said she is sticking with a data-dependent position. FOMC officials in September indicated an additional cut is likely before the end of the year.\"As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks,\" she said. \"Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\"\"Certainly we want to see if tariff effects are persistent, to see if firms are waiting to raise prices, to see what they've done with inventory,\" she added. \"So there's a lot to look at. There's a lot to anticipate with the December meeting coming up.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets during his Wednesday post-meeting news conference when he said the December cut is not a sure thing. Powell noted a wide dispersion of opinions on the committee, known more often for its consensus approach to policy.\"Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,\" Cook said, using what has become boilerplate language for Fed officials. \"We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated.\"On inflation, she said Trump's tariffs have not fully made their way through the economy. However, she said the most likely outcome is a \"one-time increase\" in prices not likely to fuel inflation over the longer term.",

    "body": "Signage is displayed outside a Yum! Brands Inc. Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue growth, fueled by strong demand for Taco Bell and improved U.S. sales for KFC.The restaurant company also announced plans to review strategic options for Pizza Hut. The embattled pizza chain has struggled to win over diners in recent years. In its home market, pizza fatigue after pandemic lockdowns have led to slumping sales, and rivals like Domino's Pizza have taken share from Pizza Hut.\"We believe a different approach, including but not limited to, a sale of the business, would allow Pizza Hut to realize its full potential,\" CEO Chris Turner said on the company's conference call.Yum shares gained 5% in early trading.Here's what Yum reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.58 adjusted. May not compare to $1.49 expected.Revenue: $1.98 billion vs. $1.97 billion expectedYum reported third-quarter net income of $397 million, or $1.41 per share, up from $382 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier.Excluding the cost of its strategic review of Pizza Hut and other items, the company earned $1.58 per share.Net sales rose 8% to $1.98 billion.Yum's digital sales, which include mobile, delivery and kiosk orders, reached $10 billion systemwide and accounted for roughly 60% of orders.The company's same-store sales increased 3%, lifted by Taco Bell and KFC.Taco Bell's same-store sales climbed 7% in the quarter, topping analyst estimates of 5.2% growth, according to StreetAccount. While other fast-food chains have seen their sales slump, the Mexican-inspired chain has bucked the trend. Its value perception, even among pinched low-income diners, and buzzy menu innovation have helped Taco Bell grow sales.\"We're not seeing consumer pull back in the Taco Bell business,\" Turner said. \"We do think the consumer in the U.S. is cautious, but incredibly resilient.\"Yum announced it is buying 128 Taco Bell locations in the Southeast U.S. The company franchises about 98% of its restaurantsKFC reported same-store sales growth of 3%, beating StreetAccount estimates of 2.4%. In China, the brand's largest market, system sales rose 6%.And in the U.S., where it has lost market share to new players like Raising Cane's, KFC's same-store sales increased 2%.Turner credited the strength of KFC to new leadership of Catherine Tan-Gillespie, who took over as U.S. president of the chain in April. Under Tan-Gillespie, KFC's U.S. business has changed its marketing tactics and introduced spicy wings.\"Early days on the turnaround, but we're pleased with the green shoots,\" Turner said.Only Pizza Hut saw same-store sales declines. The struggling pizza chain reported same-store sales fell 1% in the quarter, fueled by a 7% drop in sales at U.S. restaurants open at least a year. Analysts surveyed by StreetAccount were projecting same-store sales declines of just 0.3%.\"We remain focused on strengthening business performance,\" Yum CFO Ranjith Roy said on the company's conference call. \"That said, as we prepare the business for a potential transaction, our Q4 results may see some impact from actions involving isolated franchisee situations.\"For example, Pizza Hut's U.K. operator DC London Pie Limited fell into insolvency in October, leading to at least 68 store closures.",

    "body": "A Pizza Hut store is seen on November 01, 2023 in Austin, Texas. Pizza Hut's third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' expectations for same-store sales. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Tuesday announced it will explore strategic options for Pizza Hut.\"The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,\" Yum CEO Chris Turner said in a statement.The company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the review process. While Yum did not specify what the review's \"range of strategic options\" include, potential outcomes could be an outright divestiture, a joint venture or the sale of a stake in the chain.\"We do think the business can be positioned for even greater success in the future,\" Turner said on the company's earnings conference call. \"In some markets, there may be a multi-year effort that is required to reposition it as the leading pizza brand in those markets, and it's possible that those efforts may best be done under a different structure, potentially under outside ownership.\"Pizza Hut has been a part of a triumvirate with KFC and Taco Bell for decades, dating back to when PepsiCo still owned the fast-food chains. The beverage giant spun off the restaurants in 1997, christening the new company Tricon Global, later renamed to Yum.Tuesday's announcement caps years of struggle for Pizza Hut.On Tuesday, Yum reported that the chain's same-store sales fell 1% during the third quarter, fueled by a 6% drop in its home market. During the same quarter, Taco Bell and KFC reported same-store sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively.Before the pandemic, Pizza Hut tried to shrug off its reputation as a dine-in venue and reposition itself as an option for pizza delivery and carryout in the U.S. When Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered restaurants, the chain saw its sales skyrocket, like the rest of its pizza industry. But once restrictions loosened, so-called pizza fatigue settled in, leading to another sales slump.And now, with consumers dining out less often, Pizza Hut is facing increased competition for a smaller set of diners. The chain's share of the U.S. pizza market has shrunk from 22.6% in 2019 to 18.7% in 2024, ceding customers to rival Domino's Pizza, according to Barclays.In the wake of the pullback in consumer spending, other restaurant companies have recently shed challenged parts of their businesses in an effort to improve their balance sheets.Starbucks on Monday announced it is selling a majority stake in its embattled China business and will form a joint venture with Boyu Capital. Last month, Jack in the Box divested Del Taco for $115 million, well short of the $575 million it paid for the chain less than four years ago. And Krispy Kreme sold its remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies this summer to focus on growing its U.S. business profitably.",

But he drew a larger share of the vote than he had received in the 2016 election, partly by making inroads with the state's Latino communities.Sherrill courted those voters, who have traditionally favored Democrats, in part by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail and in TV ads.She has also run a campaign centered on affordability, hewing to Democrats' broader messaging strategy.\"Vote Here Today\" signage outside a polling location at Hillside Elementary School in Montclair, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid roughly 9% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell more than 2% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

Santiago | Getty ImagesNew York Attorney General Letitia James and more than a dozen other state attorneys general on Monday sued the Trump administration over its new rule limiting eligibility for a popular student loan forgiveness program.The AGs' lawsuit, filed in Boston federal court, was prompted by the U.S. Department of Education's final rule released last week. The rule changes the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude certain organizations \"that engage in unlawful activities\" such as \"supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration,\" according to an Education Department statement.PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W. Bush, offers debt cancellation after a decade to borrowers who work for non-profits and the government.\"Public Service Loan Forgiveness was created as a promise to teachers, nurses, firefighters, and social workers that their service to our communities would be honored,\" said Attorney General James in a statement.\"Instead, this administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,\" James said.In an email to CNBC, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the rule \"commonsense reform.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageDonations to hunger relief charities surge amid SNAP crisis: How to give wiselyWith fewer safety nets, 'robbed' Gen X is facing a retirement crisis, top advisor saysStates sue Trump over rule limiting student loan forgiveness for public servantsHow to navigate open enrollment as health insurance premiums increaseMany mutual fund strategies are launching as ETFs: What it means for investorsThese inherited IRA mistakes could reduce your windfall, advisors sayLayoffs are mounting, making it a 'challenging time to be unemployed': expertWhy travel insurance may not protect you in the government shutdownStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedMore than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Over 9 million borrowers may be eligible for PSLF, according to a 2022 estimate from Protect Borrowers, a nonprofit focused on student loans.President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness efforts, which included making it easier to qualify for PSLF. Under President Joe Biden, more than 1 million people had their debts cleared under the program, according to a 2024 White House fact sheet.The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.A coalition of cities across the U.S, labor unions and nonprofit organizations also filed a lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration over its PSLF rule.\"The Trump Administration's illegal actions threaten to make higher education even more expensive for Boston's teachers, first responders, and civil servants,\" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a statement.",

    "body": "watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that there are other options in case of defeat as the Supreme Court is about to hear a landmark case on President Donald Trump's tariffs,The high court is set Wednesday to hear arguments on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact sweeping duties on U.S. trading partners.At stake is the leeway presidents have to wield over trade measures as a tool of economic policy. Bessent expressed confidence in a CNBC \"Squawk Box\" interview that the administration will prevail, but has additional outlets it can use in case the decision goes the other way.\"There are lots of other authorities that can be used, but IEEPA is by far the cleanest, and it gives the U.S. and the president the most negotiating authority,\" he said. \"The others are more cumbersome, but they can be effective,\"Specifically, Bessent sited Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which provides a justification on grounds of national security, as well as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which regulates unfair trading practices.However, they would limit the president's ability to use tariffs, as Trump has, under \"emergency\" grounds.\"This is very important tomorrow, and SCOTUS is going to hear this,\" Bessent said, referring to the court's nickname. \"This is a signature policy for the president, and traditionally, SCOTUS has been loath to interfere with these signature policies.\"Outside of the court case, the secretary talked up the relationship the White House has with China, following last week's meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. An agreement reached at the gathering in South Korea resulted in deals that set back some of the most onerous tariffs the two sides had slapped on each other.\"It was a very good meeting. Both sides approached it with great respect,\" Bessent said. \"I think President Trump is the only leader who President Xi respects. ... The relationship is in a good place.\"Bessent said there are two state visits set up for 2026, one in Beijing and the other in the U.S.",

Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesNintendo raised its forecast for sales of the Switch 2 console in its current fiscal year as momentum for its new flagship console grows.The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 19 million units of the Switch in the fiscal year ending March 2026 versus a previous forecast of 15 million units.Here's how Nintendo did in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 versus LSEG estimates:Revenue: 527.2 billion Japanese yen ($3.7 billion) versus 461.76 billion yen expected.Net profit: 102.9 billion Japanese yen versus 63.6 billion yen expected.Revenue was up over 90% year-on-year while profit rose more than 270%.Nintendo is riding a wave of momentum after launching its latest console called the Switch 2 in June, with the stock up nearly 40% this year.Nintendo said it sold 4.54 million units of the Switch 2 in the September quarter. That was a decline compared to the \"high demand seen immediately following the launch of Nintendo Switch 2\" during its fiscal first quarter, Nintendo said, adding that \"performance remained strong.\"In total, Nintendo has sold 10.36 million units of the Switch 2 since launch.watch now\"Mario Kart World\" and \"Donkey Kong Bonanza\" have proved to be two of Nintendo's most popular games since the Switch 2 launch, helping the company record 11.95 million units of software sold for the console in the quarter.Nintendo's optimism around the Switch 2 prompted the company to also raise other financial forecasts. The Kyoto-headquartered firm said it now sees net sales at 2.25 trillion yen for its fiscal year versus a previous forecast of 1.9 trillion yen. It also hiked its net profit outlook by nearly 17% to 350 billion yen.New games in focusNintendo's original Switch, first released in 2017, has become its second-best selling console of all time after the Nintendo DS. The hybrid nature – where people could play the console at home and on the go – has caught on.There were questions swirling over whether Nintendo's Switch 2 would be different enough from its predecessor to entice users. So far, initial Switch 2 sales appear to be strong for Nintendo. Investors will now assess the current quarter and demand during the critical holiday season.Nintendo managed to maintain sales for the original Switch over several years thanks to games based around key franchises like Super Mario and Pokemon, a playbook it is looking to replicate with the Switch 2.Last month, Nintendo released \"Pokémon Legends: Z-A\" as well as an offer that bundles the game with the Switch 2 console. \"Kirby Air Riders\" and \"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond\" are also scheduled for this year.\"We will aim to keep the momentum of released titles and continuously introduce new titles to expand the platform's user base,\" Nintendo said in its earnings release.",

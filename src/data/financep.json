    "body": "What skills can help make you more attractive in the job market or workplace today?LinkedIn's 2026 Skills on the Rise list, published Tuesday, identifies the fastest-growing skills in the U.S.\"We've seen the skills required to do our jobs evolve dramatically in the last 10 years, with even more change on the way, largely fueled by AI,\" Andrew Seaman, LinkedIn News Senior Editor-at-Large for Jobs & Career Development, tells CNBC Make It. \"Employers are looking less at job titles or degrees and more at what people can actually do.\"The list was determined by analyzing year-over-year growth in \"skill acquisition\" and \"hiring success\" from Dec. 1, 2024 to Nov. 30, 2025, compared to the period from Dec. 1, 2023 to Nov. 30, 2024. The report looked at the increase in LinkedIn members adding a given skill to their profiles (skill acquisition) and the increase in members with a given skill who got hired during that period (hiring success).LinkedIn grouped individual fast-growing skills into broader categories based on use cases and other factors.\"Think of your skills like career currency — they help determine who gets hired, who gets promoted, and who's tapped for new projects,\" Seaman says. \"Even as industries evolve or companies change, skills are what give you flexibility and resilience, especially in an uncertain job market.\"Here are the top categories in LinkedIn's 2026 skills on the rise list and some of the individual skills that fall under each:AI engineering and implementation, including data annotation and prompt engineering Operational efficiency, including logistics management and process optimizationAI business strategy, including data governance and responsible AIExecutive and stakeholder communications, including public speaking and relationship developmentFinancial operations and reporting, including cash reporting and financial data analysisLeadership and people management, including cross-functional team management and talent developmentBusiness revenue growth, including account development and go-to-market strategyRisk compliance management, including policy compliance and safety monitoringThe list is a mix of \"hard\" skills, particularly in AI, and \"soft\" skills like communication and people management. \"Those [who] embrace AI, are curious with the technology, and use it in their daily work will be seen as the future leaders at each company,\" LinkedIn COO Dan Shapero previously told Make It. AI literacy was the top skill on LinkedIn's 2025 Skills on the Rise list.Soft skills like conflict mitigation, adaptability and innovative thinking made up roughly half of LinkedIn's 2025 list. They're crucial to our day-to-day work, Andrew McCaskill, formerly a career expert at LinkedIn, previously told Make It. \"Human-centric skills\" like these, he said, are \"really game changers.\" Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice has withheld from public disclosure in its Epstein files database memos and notes about FBI interviews, including those of a woman who has alleged President Donald Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor, MS NOW reported Tuesday.The woman, who was interviewed in July 2019 by the FBI about allegations against convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, alleged that \"Trump forced her to perform oral sex on him 35 years ago, when she was 13 or 14 years old, and subsequently hit her,\" MS NOW reported, citing a source who has reviewed unredacted documents.\"That allegation appears in a 2025 PowerPoint presentation detailing each of the FBI's Epstein-related investigations and a spreadsheet of unconfirmed tips called into the bureau's National Threat Operations Center reviewed by MS NOW,\" the outlet reported. \"MS NOW has found that of at least four interviews the FBI conducted with the woman related to the Epstein investigations, only one memo — and no handwritten notes — reflecting such an interview is included on the DOJ site.\"MS NOW's report came hours after NPR first reported that the DOJ withheld from its public database of Epstein documents files related to allegations that Trump sexually abused a minor. DOJ \"also removed some documents from the public database where accusations against Jeffrey Epstein also mention Trump,\" NPR reported.A law signed by Trump in late 2025 requires the DOJ to make public, with few exceptions, all of its investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.Trump is a former friend of Epstein. The two fell out in the early 2000s. The president has never been criminally charged in connection with a claim by an Epstein survivor.Trump last week said the Epstein files had \"totally exonerated\" him.Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., in a statement on Tuesday said, \"For the last few weeks, Oversight Democrats have been investigating the FBI's handling of allegations from 2019 of sexual assault on a minor made against President Donald Trump by a survivor.\"Yesterday, I reviewed unredacted evidence logs at the Department of Justice. Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,\" said Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\"Oversight Democrats will open a parallel investigation into this.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 live updates: Trump speechEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealGarcia also said that because of a prior subpoena issued by the Oversight Committee, as well as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, \"These records must immediately be shared with Congress and the American public.\"\"Covering up direct evidence of a potential assault by the President of the United States is the most serious possible crime in this White House cover up,\" he said.The DOJ, when contacted by CNBC for comment, pointed to a post on X in which it responded to Garcia's statement.\"@OversightDems should stop misleading the public while manufacturing outrage from their radical anti-Trump base,\" the post said. \"@TheJusticeDept has repeatedly said publicly AND directly to @NPR prior to deadline - NOTHING has been deleted. If files are temporarily pulled for victim redactions or to redact Personally Identifiable Information, then those documents are promptly restored online and are publicly available.\"\"ALL responsive documents have been produced unless a document falls within one of the following categories: duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation,\" DOJ said.The White House referred CNBC to the DOJ's X post when asked for comment.Trump was asked by a reporter last week about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, by police in the United Kingdom on suspicion of misconduct in public office. That arrest is believed to be related to an investigation into whether Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, had shared confidential trade reports with Epstein.\"I'm the expert in a way because I've been totally exonerated. That's very nice. I can actually speak about it very nicely,\" Trump said of the arrest.\"I think it's a shame. I did nothing,\" the president said.Disclosure: CNBC and MS NOW are divisions of Versant Media.",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a roundtable on housing affordability in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoth congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump both want to limit how many homes major corporations can own, but a new proposal from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., makes it clear that's where the agreement ends. In a bill released hours before Trump's State of the Union speech, Warren, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and 16 other Senate Democrats propose ending some housing-related tax benefits for major corporations. The bill would prevent companies with more than 50 single-family homes for rent from taking deductions for housing value depreciation and mortgage interest payments. Corporations would also be barred from getting federally backed mortgages. The bill would provide a temporary carve-out for companies building new multifamily housing or rehabilitating properties that would otherwise be uninhabitable. The Trump administration is pushing its own housing proposal. In a memo sent to lawmakers last week, the administration proposed banning institutional investors who own more than 100 single-family homes from buying any new ones. Trump's proposal also includes several exceptions for companies that increase the number of single-family homes.The dueling proposals come as legislation to boost housing supply and affordability is in the home stretch to becoming law. The House passed a bipartisan bill earlier this month with broad support, and the Senate advanced its own bipartisan bill last year. The two sides are working to combine the proposals into a final package. ",

    "body": "A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Lucid Group reported mixed fourth-quarter results Tuesday as the electric vehicle maker continues to face challenging market conditions and internal struggles.The company widely missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, while beating average revenue estimates by roughly 12%. It also revised its 2025 production results due to internal validation issues, but guided for a notable increase in vehicle production this year.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: $3.62 vs. a loss of $2.62 cents expected Revenue: $523 million vs. $468 million expectedLucid's results come days after the company laid off 12% of its U.S. salaried workforce in an effort to streamline operations and \"operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long term growth,\" according to a statement from the company.Interim Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff described the cuts Tuesday to CNBC as a needed realignment of the company's workforce amid broader market and economic concerns as well as needed gains in efficiency. \"We are adjusting and going to a level where we think we want to be and need to be,\" he said. \"But it's nothing that will continue in the future.\"For 2026, the company announced a vehicle production target of between 25,000 and 27,000 units. That would mark an increase of roughly 40% to 51% compared with the year-end figures the company released Tuesday.Lucid said the revision for the year — from 18,378 units to 17,840 units — came as \"538 vehicles had not completed certain internal procedures required under its final validation process to be classified as produced.\"The company said the vehicles are expected to be completed this year, with the change not affecting its previously reported financial results.Winterhoff described the expected growth as \"healthy,\" but not \"outrageous\" given the current slowdown in overall vehicle sales, including EVs.\"Our initial plans were higher, but we wanted to really be conservative and make sure that we are hitting the numbers that we are projecting,\" he told CNBC.watch nowLucid is expected to begin production of a new, less expensive midsize vehicle at the end of this year, but Winterhoff said it will not be material to its 2026 production plans. He said the automaker's Gravity SUV is expected to account for the majority of its production and sales this year, followed by the Air sedan. The company also plans to launch its first Lucid robotaxis with previously announced partners.Winterhoff said the company's main priorities this year are achieving its production target, growing sales, continuing efficiency gains and preparing for production of the midsize vehicle and robotaxis. \"We really want to make sure that we [are] on our path to profitability, make sure that we're not spending money that we don't have to. That's very, very important,\" he told CNBC.Lucid has yet to say when the company expects to be profitable. It is scheduled to host an investor day on March 12 in New York.Lucid said it ended last year with approximately $4.6 billion in total liquidity, which Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said was \"strong\" and would provide flexibility \"to execute near-term objectives while investing in future growth.\"Lucid reported a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2025, in line with a $2.71 billion loss a year earlier. That includes more than doubling its year-over-year losses during the fourth quarter to $814 million. It reported a loss of $12.09 per share for the year. The company's 2025 revenue was up 68% to $1.35 billion, including more than doubling year-over-year results during the fourth quarter.",

Though the company said last quarter that it saw a pullback among younger consumers, Tolivar said that trend came to an end in the final three months of its fiscal year.\"We actually saw firming in that category, and overall [we're] seeing improvement in our trends across income cohorts, age cohorts, different parts of the country,\" Tolivar said. \"And in fact, we believe there's a little bit of a bridge that we've been able to create in this K-shaped economy, where we want to be accessible for everyone, and we're doing our best to ensure that our amazing culinary and incredible hospitality is there for all customers across the country.\"She added that some of Cava's best performing restaurants are in markets where median household incomes are lower.The restaurant chain reported same-store sales up 0.5% in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates of a 1.1% decline, according to StreetAccount. Much of that growth was thanks to menu prices and product mix, and partially offset by a 1.4% decline in foot traffic, the company said. Tolivar said Cava raised prices about 1.7% at the beginning of 2025 and that 2026 would see \"very modest increases.\"The company also recorded 72 net new restaurant openings in fiscal 2025 for a total of 439 locations.Here's how Cava performed in the period ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. 3 cents expectedRevenue: $275 million vs. $268 million expectedIn the fourth quarter, Cava reported net income of $4.9 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to $78.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of $275 million marked an increase of nearly 21% year over year. For the full fiscal year, the company reported record-breaking revenue surpassing $1 billion, a growth of more than 20% compared to the year prior. Same-restaurant sales for the year increased by 4%. \"We believe our momentum reflects more than just expansion,\" CEO Brett Schulman said on a call with analysts. \"It signals that our value proposition is resonating with today's increasingly discerning consumer, and as guests become more intentional with their spend, they are choosing brands like Cava that deliver real differentiation through bold flavors, healthy food and hospitality that creates meaningful human connection.\"For fiscal year 2026, Cava said it expects 74 to 76 net new restaurant openings, in addition to same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. Tolivar said the company is expecting strong results from its upcoming menu additions, including a salmon offering, which will mark Cava's first entry into seafood.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, attends the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., in New York, Oct. 21, 2025.Eduardo Munoz | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is taking steps to address the impact of artificial intelligence on its workers, and part of what he said should be a broader societal response to the potentially disruptive nature of AI.Dimon described at an investor meeting late Monday his bank's internal plans to shift employees into new roles as automation accelerates.\"We already have huge redeployment plans for [our] own people,\" Dimon said. \"In fact, we spoke about it today, and we have to up that a little bit so we can take people who are displaced — and we have displaced people from AI — and we offer them other jobs.\"JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank by market cap, has the industry's largest annual tech budget at nearly $20 billion. Its executives have outlined an ambitious agenda to become \"fundamentally rewired\" for the AI era.Even at this early stage, the bank's workforce provides a snapshot of what happens when corporations employ AI technology, including models from OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both used by JPMorgan's AI portal.The bank's head count was roughly unchanged at 318,512 over the past year, but there were changes below the surface: Operations and support staff fell by 4% and 2%, respectively, as the firm added 4% to roles that involve catering to clients and generating revenue.It did that by using technology to boost the number of accounts that each operations employee can handle (up 6%), reducing the per-unit cost to deal with fraud (down 11%) and making their software engineers 10% more efficient, according to the bank's presentation.  JPMorgan has doubled the use cases for generative AI this year, focusing on customer service and the firm's technology workers, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said at the investor meeting.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Dimon's comments about plans for redeployment. Disruption risk When an analyst on Monday asked if Dimon was concerned about the risk of widespread unemployment because of AI — one of several fears circulating as every AI model update seemed to wallop the shares of public companies in recent weeks — Dimon had this response: \"We are going to deploy AI as best we can to do a better job for our customers.\" The CEO  has previously likened the potential impact of AI to that of electricity or the printing press.Beyond the \"huge redeployment plans\" for his bank, Dimon expressed concern that the rapid adoption of AI could put entire professions out of work.As a thought experiment, what if autonomous trucks were introduced overnight, he asked.\"Would you do it if you put 2 million people on the street?\" Dimon asked. \"That next job is $25,000 a year, stocking shelves.\"Businesses and governments need to begin planning for this risk now, with ideas including assistance and training for displaced workers, he said.\"Society's got to think through what it wants to do if this becomes that kind of problem,\" Dimon said. \"Now is the time to start thinking about it.\"watch now",

So many people have been praying, of every faith and no faith at all, praying for her return, and we feel those prayers,\" Guthrie said.\"We still believe that she can come home, hope against hope, as my sister says,\" Guthrie said. \"We are blowing on the embers of hope.

    "body": "watch nowWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said Paramount Skydance had raised its takeover offer to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, in a proposal that could \"reasonably be expected\" to top an existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would reengage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction.\"Later Tuesday, WBD said the amended Paramount offer was for $31 per share, all cash, and included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. Paramount has also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if it were to abandon that deal, as well as a so-called ticking fee tied to delays in getting regulators' approval, WBD said. \"The Board has not made a determination as to whether the revised PSKY proposal is superior to the merger with Netflix,\" it said in a statement. \"WBD will engage further with PSKY to determine if a proposal that constitutes a 'Company Superior Proposal,' as defined in the Netflix Merger Agreement, can be reached.\"If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets at around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.The Warner Bros. Discovery board said Tuesday it continued to advise shareholders not to take action in response to the tender offer. A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, Copenhagen, Denmark, Feb. 4, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Tuesday said it plans to slash the monthly list prices of its popular obesity and diabetes drugs in the U.S. by up to 50% starting in 2027, in a bid to make the treatments more accessible to patients with insurance coverage. The obesity injection Wegovy, its new pill counterpart, the diabetes shot Ozempic and the oral diabetes drug Rybelsus will have a new lower list price of $675 per month starting on Jan. 1, 2027. The Wegovy medicines both currently have list prices of around $1,350 per month, while the diabetes drugs have list prices of around $1,027 per month. For the first time, Novo said its price cuts are targeting insured patients whose out-of-pocket costs are linked to list prices, such as people with high-deductible health plans or coinsurance benefit designs. \"Both of these patient populations should, beginning [in 2027], see a benefit with lower out-of-pocket burdens,\" Jamey Millar, the company's head of U.S. operations, told CNBC in an interview. He added that Novo expects improvements in access and uptake among patients in the commercial insurance market, though the company is not giving any specific expectations.The move could help Novo compete better with Eli Lilly, which now holds the majority share in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. Lilly's more effective drugs and earlier foray into the direct-to-consumer space have allowed it to take the lead in the space, but the company has yet to significantly lower the U.S. list prices of its medicines.watch nowIt's unclear exactly how much commercial insured patients typically pay out of pocket for Novo's drugs. Those patients may pay as little as $25 per month for Novo's drugs in \"only the best of circumstances,\" Millar said. But patients in high-deductible plans would have to pay out of pocket \"more or less the full list price of a drug until they reach that\" threshold and the insurance benefit kicks in, he added. Millar said some of those patients defer treatment entirely because they don't want to shoulder that expense. The number of patients using high-deductible plans has increased over the years due to the trade-off of lower premiums, he noted. Meanwhile, Millar said other people have 25% to 33% of their coinsurance linked to the list prices of those drugs.The Danish drugmaker has previously cut the direct-to-consumer prices of Wegovy and Ozempic, which primarily benefit cash-paying patients who often don't have insurance coverage for the drugs. Novo offers its drugs to cash-paying patients for $149 to $499 per month, depending on the specific product and dose. Novo and Lilly have escalated a GLP-1 pricing war over the last year, especially following the landmark \"most favored nation\" deals they struck with President Donald Trump in November.The move also coincides with new, lower Medicare prices going into effect for Novo's obesity and diabetes drugs in 2027 following negotiations with the federal government under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new negotiated prices for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus will be $274 per month. ",

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSix Democratic senators told the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a previously unreported letter that they have strong concerns about prediction market contracts \"that incentivize physical injury or death,\" saying the contracts \"present dangerous national security risks.\"The senators urged CFTC Chairman Michael Selig in the letter sent Monday to \"clearly reiterate that the CFTC will categorically prohibit any contract that resolves upon or closely correlates to an individual's death.\"The letter, led by Sen. Adam Schiff of California, notes that under federal commodity regulations, the CFTC already \"categorically prohibits\" contracts that involve or reference terrorism, assassination, war or similar actions. The letter was sent as prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have become increasingly popular and as questions have been raised about how those markets should be regulated, whether they are contributing to a rise in gambling addiction, and about the risk of people with inside information taking positions on contracts.The letter notes that the CFTC \"has cleared the way\" for Polymarket to reenter the U.S. market after U.S. users being ostensibly blocked from accessing contracts on the company's offshore exchange.In addition to Schiff, the Democrats who signed the letter are Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, New Jersey's Cory Booker, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen.The CFTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter, which cites three contracts offered by Polymarket in recent months relating to a NASA spaceship launch, the fate of Venezuela's authoritarian leader, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"These recent events highlight the lack of internal controls and safeguards to prevent insiders from profiting off of non-public information, and direct profiteering off of human suffering,\" the letter said.The CFTC last week filed a legal brief in a federal appeals court asserting that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the U.S. commodity derivatives markets and that individual states had no role in exercising such oversight.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by  seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" Selig wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the filing.Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 live updates: Trump speechEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealThe senators' letter noted that one of Polymarket's contracts asked if Artemis II, the upcoming NASA crewed spaceflight mission, would explode.That contract, which Polymarket listed on Jan. 20, saw the bet \"Yes\" trading as high as 8% before it \"was subsequently renamed and ultimately withdrawn due to public backlash,\" the letter said.\"Not only did this contract directly correlate with crewmember death, it incentivized the failure of the mission and potential insider sabotage,\" the letter said.Polymarket in a Feb. 15 post on X about the controversy said, \"To clarify: this was a market about a potential booster-stage rupture — a defined hardware failure scenario — not about the Orion crew capsule or astronaut safety. This was not a market on crew injury or loss of life.\"Another contract on Polymarket was on the question of whether Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro would be removed from power. On Jan. 5, an unknown trader made $20,000 in bets that Maduro would be out by Jan. 31, and about two hours after those bets were placed, President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Venezuela that led to Maduro's capture and removal to the United States for criminal prosecution.\"When Polymarket resolved the contract around twelve hours later, this trader had netted more than $400,000 in profits,\" the letter noted, citing reporting by The Wall Street Journal.A Polymarket advertisement in a subway station in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn the third example cited by the senators,  \"In November 2025, Polymarket resolved a contract that the Ukrainian town of Myrnohad would be captured by Russian forces by November 15, and individuals who bet YES profited by as much as 33,000 percent.\"\"Public reporting later found that a staffer at the Institute for the Study of War, a D.C. based think tank, had edited its map to show that Russia had taken control of a key intersection in the town, 'despite the lack of indications' that Russia had made any such advance,\" the senators wrote. \"This is a contract that unambiguously 'involves, relates to, or references' war and clearly displays the dangers of listing such contracts.\"The letter said the three contracts \"underscore the dangerous incentives directly or indirectly tied to offering contracts related to prohibited categories under the\" Commodity Exchange Act.The senators warned that government officials, regulated entities and consultants who may have knowledge about possible policy changes \"can easily act on confidential or operationally sensitive information to personally profit in markets that operate with minimal oversight or transparency, or share this information with contacts who can similarly profit.\"\"These contracts further risk incentivizing real-world harm by creating financial rewards linked to destabilizing events or physical injury, and by encouraging actors to influence or precipitate those outcomes for personal profit,\" the letter said.",

    "body": "United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth speaks during a visit to Sierra Space in Louisville, Colorado on Monday, Feb. 23, 2026. Aaron Ontiveroz | Denver Post | Getty ImagesDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has told Anthropic it has until Friday evening to give the military broad access to its artificial intelligence models, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday. If Anthropic fails to comply, Hegseth threatened to label the company a \"supply chain risk\" or invoke the Defense Production Act, according to sources familiar with the discussion, who asked not to be named because the matter was private. Anthropic's negotiations with the Department of Defense have stalled because it wants assurance that its models will not be used for autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans. The DoD, meanwhile, wants the company to agree to \"all lawful use cases\" without limitation. A \"supply chain risk\" is a designation that's typically reserved for foreign adversaries, but it would require the DoD's vendors and contractors to certify that they do not use Anthropic's models. The Defense Production Act allows the president to control domestic industries under emergency authority when it's in the interest of national security.Hegseth set the deadline during a meeting with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on Tuesday morning, the people said.\"We continued good-faith conversations about our usage policy to ensure Anthropic can continue to support the government's national security mission in line with what our models can reliably and responsibly do,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo opens robotaxi service to 'select riders' in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and OrlandoMeta strikes AI chip deal with AMD days after committing to deploy millions of Nvidia GPUsUber acquiring parking app SpotHero as it moves beyond ride-hailing and food deliveryTesla sues California DMV to reverse ruling that company engaged in false advertising on FSDAnthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. The company was awarded a $200 million contract with the DoD last year.Until this week, Anthropic was the only AI company cleared to deploy its models on the agency's classified networks. Elon Musk's xAI is now the second, as the company recently agreed to allow its models to be deployed in classified settings, according to a senior Pentagon official. The White House's relationship with Anthropic has been rocky since President Donald Trump returned to office, and officials have not been afraid to publicly criticize the company. David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, has accused Anthropic of supporting \"woke AI\" because of its stance on regulation.Losing its contract with the DoD would be a blow to Anthropic, but the company has a number of other large enterprise customers. Anthropic said earlier this month that it has more than 500 customers that spend more than $1 million on an annual basis. The company also just got an infusion of fresh capital, as it closed a $30 billion funding round at a $380 billion valuation this month. WATCH: Defense Sec.

David Luan announced his departure Tuesday in a LinkedIn post, saying he will exit at the end of the week \"to cook up something new.\" Amazon tapped Luan in December 2024 to oversee its newly created AGI lab, based in San Francisco. The lab is focused on \"long-term research bets,\" including developing \"useful AI agents.\" Last year, the group released Amazon's Nova Act agent, an extension of its Nova models, which the company hopes will compete with leading AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini.\"There's incredible work to be done at Amazon and opportunities for me to take on more areas,\" Luan wrote. \"But with AGI so close, I decided to spend 100% of my time on teaching AI systems brand new capabilities.\" Luan's departure comes after Amazon announced a major reorganization of its AGI division late last year, bringing it under Peter DeSantis, a 27-year veteran of the company and a senior vice president in its cloud unit. AGI refers to artificial intelligence that can perform as well or better than humans on most tasks.Amazon in June 2024 hired Luan and other top executives from Adept. It also licensed technology from Adept, including some of its AI models and datasets. The deal size was not disclosed.Federal Trade Commission Chairman Andrew Ferguson in January said his agency would review these AI acqui-hire deals to learn whether tech companies are attempting to evade regulatory reviews. The agency in 2024 opened a probe into Amazon's hiring of Adept employees. AI acqui-hire deals have also come under scrutiny from lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.Amazon representatives declined to comment. WATCH: AWS CEO Matt Garman on Europe's skepticism of U.S. big tech, the AI capex wave and cloud demandwatch now",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook (R) speaks as U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during an event in the Oval Office of the White House on August 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win Mcnamee | Getty ImagesApple said it's moving production of some of its Mac Mini computers to the U.S. later this year as the company seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing. The iPhone maker last year unveiled plans to invest $600 billion in the U.S., with CEO Tim Cook appearing at the White House with President Donald Trump in August for the announcement of a $100 billion outlay. The company also has said it will purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers. \"As part of our $600B commitment, Mac mini will be produced in the US for the first time later this year!\" Cook wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. \"We're accelerating our progress even further — producing more AI servers and opening an all-new Apple Advanced Manufacturing Center for hands-on training.\"The Mac Mini is Apple's compact, more affordable desktop computer, which start at about $600, according to the company's website. Later this year, production will begin at a new factory in Houston, where Apple started producing AI servers last year, the company said in a statement.  \"We began shipping advanced AI servers from Houston ahead of schedule, and we're excited to accelerate that work even further,\" Cook said in the release.Apple has been hit hard by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, paying about $3.3 billion since the president initiated the levies last year. Apple is sourcing half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most of its other U.S.-bound products like Macs, AirPods and watches from Vietnam. The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a large chunk of President Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, but uncertainty remains after Trump rebuked the decision. Apple said its 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center in Houston will open its doors later this year. The company said it will provide training in advanced manufacturing techniques to students, supplier employees, and American businesses, teaching them \"the same innovative processes that are used to make Apple products.\"WATCH: How the Supreme Court's tariff ruling could shift Apple's supply chainwatch now",

Bloomberg reported the news, citing people familiar with the matter, and said the discussions are in early stages. The report said Stripe is considering buying all or some segments of PayPal's business.The news comes a day after reports that buyer interest has picked up in the company following its recent stock slump.  PayPal and Stripe declined to comment on the report.PayPal, which is grappling with slowing growth in an increasingly competitive financial payments industry, has plummeted more than 19% since the start of the year.

    "body": "The Cursor logo arranged on a smartphone in New Hyde Park, New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCursor announced updates to its artificial intelligence coding agents on Tuesday as the startup works to fend off increasingly stiff competition from rivals like Anthropic, OpenAI and Microsoft. The AI startup has to stay on the cutting edge to win new users and market share, and the company told CNBC that its updated agents push its capabilities to the next level. The startup's valuation has ballooned to $29.3 billion, and it said in November that it had crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue. Cursor was relatively early to the AI coding market, but other players have been quick to launch competing offerings.AI agents are tools that can complete tasks on behalf of a user, and they have exploded in popularity over the last year as model capabilities have improved. Some of the earliest adopters have been software developers, who are using agents from companies like Cursor to generate, edit and review code. Cursor's updated agents can test their own changes and record their work through videos, logs and screenshots, the company said. Users can trigger the agents from the web, Cursor's desktop app, on a mobile device, through the messaging platform Slack or on Microsoft's GitHub.The agents can also run in parallel with full development environments on their own virtual machines, which are cloud-based computers that behave just like a physical one. This means agents won't have to compete for resources locally on a developer's laptop or waste time onboarding, Cursor said.\"Instead of having one to three things that you're doing at once that are running at the same time, you can have 10 or 20 of these things running,\" ​​Alexi Robbins, co-head of engineering for asynchronous agents Cursor, told CNBC in an interview. \"You can have really high throughput with this.\"Read more CNBC tech newsWaymo opens robotaxi service to 'select riders' in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and OrlandoMeta strikes AI chip deal with AMD days after committing to deploy millions of Nvidia GPUsUber acquiring parking app SpotHero as it moves beyond ride-hailing and food deliveryTesla sues California DMV to reverse ruling that company engaged in false advertising on FSDAs of February, Anthropic's Claude Code has grown to over $2.5 billion in run-rate revenue, and OpenAI's Codex has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in October that its tool, GitHub Copilot, had more than 26 million users. Cursor was founded in 2022, and it amassed a cult following after launching the initial version of its AI coding product the following year. Developers can hand off more complex tasks to Cursor's updated agents, and those agents can test and iterate on those features until they are complete. Cursor said this will allow developers to spend less time editing files and parsing through code and more time focusing on questions of taste and judgement.\"We think of this less like a new feature and more like, 'This is what it's going to look like working with agents,'\" said Jonas Nelle, Cursor's other co-head of engineering for asynchronous agents. \"They're not just writing software, writing code, they're sort of becoming full software developers.\"Cursor has been testing the agents internally, and Nelle said it has already been a \"big transformation\" for the company. Roughly 35% of Cursor's pull requests, where a developer proposes a change to the codebase, are now generated by agents that are operating on their own virtual machines, Cursor said. \"You as an individual can do so much more by working with these agents,\" Nelle said. \"This is another step change in that progression.\"WATCH: Cursor CEO Michael Truell: We’re seeing success with our AI age, not just demandwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.\"This is about as big as it gets,\"  President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding.\" Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. \"No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles,\" he said.The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersZeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history. Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. \"less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.\"The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized \"climate denialism as official government policy.\" It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA. Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs. ",

    "body": "Ring security cameras are displayed on a shelf at a Target store on June 01, 2023 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRing is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.The partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. When a user initiates the feature, it activates a network of participating Ring cameras, which scan footage for images resembling the missing dog. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"  Flock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies. Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Privacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters. \"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"watch nowFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Amazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.Ring has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime. The Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\" Flock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have reportedly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Flock has denied that it shares data with ICE or any \"sub-agency\" of the Department of Homeland Security. Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live. \"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said. In response to the scrutiny of its Search Party tool, Daniels said Ring built the feature \"with strong privacy protections from the start.\" Ring users can decide on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner who initiates a Search Party, she said. The news was earlier reported by The Verge. ",

    "body": "U.S. and Taiwanese flags are seen in San Francisco, California, Jan. 28, 2026. Stephen Nellis | ReutersWashington and Taipei have signed a trade deal lowering tariffs on Taiwanese exports to 15%, on par with those on Asian allies Japan and South Korea, while the island will open its market for U.S. goods. Taiwan will remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide \"preferential market access\" for U.S. industrial and agricultural exports. These include autos, beef products and minerals. Taiwan also plans to purchase over $84 billion in U.S. goods from 2025 to 2029, including liquefied natural gas and crude oil, as well as aircraft and power equipment. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that Taiwan had committed to \"resolve longstanding non-tariff barriers,\" such as accepting U.S. vehicles built to U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards without any additional requirements. This deal was first announced in January when Taiwanese chip and technology companies committed to invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., backed by an equal amount of government credit \"to facilitate additional investment by Taiwanese enterprises.\" However, Taiwan and the U.S. have shared differing views on chip supply chains.The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. during U.S. President , Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last month. He also said that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff.However, Taiwan has pushed back on that proposal, telling Washington that moving 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was \"impossible,\" according to Taipei's top tariff trade negotiator.Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun told local media that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not simply be relocated.Taiwan's international expansion, including its investments in the U.S., is predicated on the notion that the industry remains' rooted in Taiwan and continues to expand domestic investments, she said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.China, which considers democratically governed Taiwan a part of its territory, had criticized the January agreement, saying that the deal would \"only drain Taiwan's economic interests,\" adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was letting the U.S. \"hollow out\" the island's key industry. Chinese President Xi Jinping regards Taiwan's reunification with the mainland \"a historical inevitability.\" Taiwan rejects those claims. While the U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and is not obligated to defend the island, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act states the U.S. \"will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services\" as may be necessary to \"enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.\"The U.S. in December approved $11.15 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, among its largest deals with the island as it faces growing threats from China, drawing a sharp response from Beijing, with its foreign affairs spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, accusing the U.S. of violating the \"one-China principle.\"— CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dylan Butts contributed to this story.",

AI agents such as OpenClaw have surged in popularity recently for their ability to automate tasks, including managing email and using online services. Previously, the Austrian-developed open-sourced AI agent could only be accessed from chat apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Chinese companies such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have already allowed users to run OpenClaw on their cloud systems.Baidu claims 700 million monthly active users for its search app. The company is also rolling out OpenClaw's capabilities to its e-commerce business and other services.The rollout comes just days ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday, as Chinese internet tech giants race to attract new users and monetize their AI investments. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tAlibaba has also integrated its e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and travel site Fliggy, with its AI chatbot Qwen, and claimed it received more than 120 million consumer orders through the app in the six days through Feb. 11.

    "body": "Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of Dubai speaks at a news conference on Nov. 10, 2005 in New York City. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.On Friday, DP World announced in a statement that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group Chief Executive Officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a \"close personal friend\" and called him one of his most trusted friends in other files. Sulayem has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. A disclosure to the Nasdaq, where DP World is listed, said Sulayem had resigned \"effective immediately.\"Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company \"affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.\"CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he served as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response.Kazim was most recently the Governor of the DIFC, Dubai's financial center. Narayan was deputy CEO and CFO at DP World since 2005. Sulayem is one of Dubai's most prominent business figures, coming from one of the Emirate's main families. His father was an advisor to the ruling Al Maktoum family and Sulayem played a key role in the ascendance of Dubai as an economic hub.Sulayem oversaw the growth of Dubai's Jebel Ali port into a major deep-water shipping hub and the expansion of DP World into an international logistics empire that now oversees ports handling a tenth of the world's container trade.He also led Nakheel Properties, a Dubai government-owned developer, though he was replaced amid a major board restructuring following Dubai World's debt issues during the 2008 financial crisis. A 'close personal friend' of Epstein The extent of Sulayem's relationship with Epstein emerged in recent weeks following the release of the latest files.The records show the Emirati businessman was in contact with Epstein after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Authorities have stressed that a mention in the Epstein files does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Jeffrey Epstein and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group CEO of DP World.House Oversight Committee Democrats Pressure from DP World's partnersThis week, pressure mounted on Sulayem to resign after international partners paused new deals with DP World, calling for the company to take the \"required action.\" Canada's second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, which has invested more than $5 billion alongside DP World over the past decade, said it would pause \"additional capital deployment alongside the company.\"In a statement sent to CNBC, La Caisse said it was \"important to distinguish the company, DP World, from the individual, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who is the focus of the current situation.\"\"On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions,\" the pension fund added. A spokesperson for British International Investment, which invests with DP World in four African ports, said it would also pause new investments.\"In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.\"",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersPinterest shares plunged as much as 20% after hours Thursday as CEO Bill Ready said the company \"absorbed an exogenous shock this year related to tariffs\" that affected top retail advertisers.The company reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss, revenue that was roughly in line with expectations and issued weak guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 69 cents expectedRevenue: $1.32 billion vs. $1.33 billion expectedReady told analysts on Thursday that the company is \"not satisfied with our Q4 revenue performance, and believe it does not reflect what Pinterest can deliver over time.\"The company's fourth-quarter sales rose 14% year-to-year. Net income for the fourth quarter came in at $277 million, down 85% from a year prior, when net income was $1.85 billion and included a deferred tax benefit.  This is the second quarter in a row in which Pinterest shed a fifth of its value after delivering Wall Street disappointing results. The impact of tariffs on large retailers \"created a more meaningful headwind than we expected,\" Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said on the call with analysts. Those retailers also pulled back on ad spend in Europe, she said.The retail sector has been reeling from President Donald Trump's ongoing trade war, which raised the price of shipping costs. The trade war has also led to companies charging customers higher prices and reducing the number of products they can put on the market. Besides implementing layoffs, the retail sector also pulled back on advertising to deal with the ongoing trade issues.Pinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $951 million to $971 million, trailing analyst estimates of $980 million.\"Looking ahead to Q1, we expect these headwinds will continue and may become slightly more pronounced in Q1, including in the U.K. and in Europe,\" Donnelly said.Pinterest recorded $541.5 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That figure fell short of the $550 million that analysts were projecting.While Pinterest sees \"opportunity over the long term\" from large advertisers, Ready said \"the near-term outlook for this cohort on our platform remains pressured given these headwinds.\"The company plans to more heavily court small-to-medium-sized and international advertisers so its core online ad business doesn't rely so heavily on large retailers, Ready said.\"Most importantly, we need to further broaden our revenue mix and accelerate the next phase of our sales and go-to-market transformation,\" he said.The disappointing results come after the company in January announced that  it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and reduce its office space in an effort to shift resources to technical teams prioritizing the development of \"AI-powered products and capabilities.\"Pinterest then fired staffers who built a tool to quantify the layoffs, and Ready admonished them during a companywide meeting, saying that \"there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist,\" CNBC reported.The January restructuring and ongoing sales unit overhaul \"may cause some near term disruption, which we factored into our guidance to be prudent,\" Donnelly said on Thursday. Despite the results and gloomy outlook, Pinterest said that fourth-quarter global monthly active users jumped 12% year-over-year to 619 million, representing an all-time high. Wall Street was expecting that figure to be 613 million.Fourth quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada region came in at $979 million, which was ahead of StreetAccount's estimates of $973 million.WATCH: Magnificent 7 trade is broken and reversing.watch now",

    "body": "DHL Autonomous Robot at work.Source: DHLWorkers at DHL Group used to walk close to a half marathon each day just to classify, pick and move items across massive warehouses.Now, their distance and efforts are greatly reduced by autonomous mobile robots that can unload containers for the package delivery and supply chain management company with a speed of up to 650 cases per hour.\"That is what we look forward to, and where we've been successful in deploying technology at scale over the last five years, going from when we started in 2020 with 240 projects, and now we're up to 10,000 projects,\" Tim Tetzlaff, DHL's global head of digital transformation, told CNBC. The company's autonomous innovations have accelerated processes at 95% of DHL's global warehouses. Item-picking robots in one warehouse have increased units picked per hour by 30%, while autonomous forklifts at that same warehouse have contributed a 20% increase in efficiency, the company said.Tetzlaff said automation is important for the company because it's such a labor-intensive business.\"We still have the ambition to grow our business even further, but if you look at where these distribution centers should be located … it's typically very tough to find additional labor or even additional spaces just to build these warehouses there,\" he said. DHL is one of multiple fulfillment companies moving toward automation and leveraging artificial intelligence as the industry works toward greater efficiency. On an earnings call with analysts in late January, United Parcel Service CEO Carol Tomé said the company deployed automation in 57 buildings in the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 127 automated buildings, with plans for 24 more in 2026.\"This year, we plan to further automate our network and as a result, we expect to increase the percentage of U.S. volume we process through automated facilities to 68% by the end of the year, up from 66.5% at the end of 2025,\" she said.Similarly, FedEx has said it sees automation as an opportunity to enhance its workers' jobs, installing robotic arms to help process small packages at its Memphis hub and working with AI company Dexterity to leverage robots for loading boxes into containers. Its \"Network 2.0\" initiative is working to increase the efficiency of its package processes.The company recently announced a partnership with Berkshire Grey to launch a fully autonomous robot to unload containers and optimize operations.It estimates that the global warehouse automation market is expected to exceed $51 billion by 2030.\"We now have about 24% of our eligible average daily volume flowing through 355 Network 2.0-optimized facilities,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam said on a call with analysts in December.A human fleetA worker unloads packages from a FedEx truck in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith the rise of automation, companies are weighing the balance between their human workers and their technological innovations.UPS has announced layoffs north of 75,000 over the past year as the company focuses on efficiency and cuts down its partnership with Amazon amid a multiyear turnaround plan.The company also said it closed 93 buildings in 2025 and plans to shutter at least 24 buildings in the first half of 2026.\"What's happening is you're seeing a cascading effect of sites being closed that are legacy conventional facilities, a lot of labor required to run those facilities, to a much more nimble, quicker, automated, consolidated facility,\" Executive Vice President Nando Cesarone said on the January call.In a statement to CNBC, a UPS spokesperson said the company is focused on making jobs easier for its employees and that the AI and robotics take on repetitive tasks that \"make us more efficient in other functions.\"FedEx did not respond to requests for comment on how the company is balancing its workforce and technology. Subramaniam said on the most recent earnings call that the Network 2.0 initiative has resulted in \"structural cost reductions\" but the company has not publicly disclosed job cut amounts.Teamsters, the union representing workers from many of the major packaging companies, said it will remain focused on ensuring its team members have a voice at the table when it comes to technology.\"We never want to get in the way of technology and its development, but all of that, it must support workers, and it cannot work against them ever,\" spokesperson Lena Melentijevic told CNBC. \"It's the workers who are the backbone of each one of these companies and who are essential to their success, and we are here to advocate for them and hold companies accountable.\"DHL's Tetzlaff said the company wants its automation to complement human labor instead of replacing it altogether. Regardless of how much DHL's technology improves, Tetzlaff said the dexterous tasks of packaging and shipping remain in the hands of the employees.\"In the time where we deployed 8,000 collaborative robotics into our operation worldwide, we still hired 40,000 people,\" he said. The biggest area where DHL has deployed its robotics is in item picking, with more than 2,500 robots using trained arms to select items for packages. This past holiday season, to keep up with the Black Friday and Christmas demand, the company added 30% capacity to its robotic fleet.\"There's an advantage for us as a company, having a great human fleet of workers that is motivated and likes the job, but complementing this with a robotic fleet that we can scale up and down and have that flexible stability to deal with change, the peaks throughout the year, be it bigger changes like Covid, be it [customer] profile changes and so on,\" he said.The path forward for investmentDHL Autonomous Forklift at work.Source: DHLStill, it's unlikely there will be a near future in which warehouses are full of humanoid robots, according to supply chain expert and Accenture logistics and fulfillment lead Benjamin Reich.Humanoid robots have been gaining intense popularity as tech companies innovate human-like machines, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying he believes the innovation is fast moving. At the January CES trade show, Google announced a partnership with Boston Dynamics, the same company working with DHL, to augment the tech company's new robot named Atlas.But Reich said among his clients, he's seeing that \"humans are still in the lead.\"\"We are also not seeing a replacement of jobs, but a shifting that you're more looking for skill sets on the market to serve the gap between degree of automation, operational tasks as well as organizational,\" Reich told CNBC. The automation is angled toward specific jobs, he added, with robots taking over repetitive tasks and companies instead \"redirecting\" their hiring toward technical roles instead of eliminating job growth altogether.Reich said the industry is seeing rising investments into automation, with the biggest gains coming not from replacing people, but through increasing the efficiency of the supply chain and warehouse execution processes.There are also factors in the broader industry that are impacting the workforce, according to Ronny Horvath, the transportation and logistics lead at Accenture. There's a shortage of skilled workers who have both the manual skills and the organizational skills needed for the sector, and there's also competition among companies for warehouse personnel based on pay, benefits, lifestyle and more.\"So automation can also help, not replacing but augmenting that gap, that void, that has been left by just not getting the workers that you have today,\" Horvath said. \"And we see a lot of clients, they have an automation or robotic strategy … but they still have the plans to hire human workers as well.\"Horvath added that the industry is reaping the rewards of its new technology. He's seen companies able to adjust to deliver on high demand, increase efficiency and work toward more automated processes to keep up with warehousing. According to an Accenture study from March, 51% of factories globally expect to have fully automated warehouses by 2040, and 70% of transportation logistics executives treat autonomous supply chains as a top investment priority.\"There's almost no autonomous structure existing at the moment,\" Horvath said. \"So most or some of these clients are starting from scratch, and this will take time until these investments are done and until they also reap the benefits out of it for all those areas.\"",

Mark Kelly over the Arizona Democrat's participation in a video reminding American military service members of their right to refuse illegal orders.Judge Rich Leon's order in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., also blocks Hegseth, for now, from reducing Kelly's U.S. Navy rank and retirement pay as punishment for his role in the video.Kelly retired from the Navy as a captain.Leon said Hegseth had \"trampled\" on Kelly's First Amendment free speech protections and that the senator is likely to succeed in his lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's effort to punish him. The preliminary injunction that the judge issued preventing that punishment could become permanent if Hegseth loses that case, as Leon strongly suggested will happen.\"This will be immediately appealed,\" Hegseth said in a post on X. \"Sedition is sedition, 'Captain.' \"The order came two days after the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. tried and failed to get a federal grand jury to indict Kelly and Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who is a former CIA analyst, on criminal charges of seditious conspiracy related to their participation in the video along with four other members of Congress. The video was released in November.President Donald Trump had condemned the Democrats who appeared on the video, accusing them of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social then.Leon, in a scathing opinion explaining his order Thursday, noted that Hegseth, in seeking to punish Kelly for his public statements as a member of Congress, relied \"on the well-established doctrine that military service members enjoy less vigorous First Amendment protections given the fundamental obligation for obedience and discipline in the armed forces.\"\"Unfortunately for Secretary Hegseth, no court has ever extended those principles to retired servicemembers, much less a retired servicemember serving in Congress and exercising oversight responsibility over the military,\" Leon wrote.\"This Court will not be the first to do so!\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

The Defense Department when asked for comment referred a reporter to Hegseth's tweet vowing an appeal of Leon's order.In addition to Hegseth and the Defense Department, the defendants in the case are the Department of the Navy and Navy Secretary John Phelan.",

It's the stock's worst day since 2022.Strong demand for artificial intelligence data centers has led to a global shortage of memory, which has caused costs to skyrocket for the component. Large orders for data center memory have limited production capacity for other devices, including smartphones.This has created uncertainty for a number of tech companies, including consumer electronics makers like Apple and Dell as well as chipmakers like Qualcomm, which cited the shortage when it issued weak guidance on Feb. 4. Now, Cisco is feeling the pinch. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins addressed memory price increases across the market on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Robbins said Cisco will raise prices, revise contracts and negotiate terms to account for the evolving component prices. \"In terms of memory, we're going to control what we can control,\" Cisco finance chief Mark Patterson said on the call.The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but shares dropped about 7% as Cisco issued a mediocre forecast.Product gross margin for the quarter was 66.4%, down 130 bps from the year prior, which Patterson said was \"primarily driven by negative impacts from mix and higher memory costs.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. lead",

    "body": "Gold and silver prices rose as U.S. Treasury bond yields fell after December retail sales growth stalled, signaling a softening economy ahead of key jobs data.Bloomberg Creative | Bloomberg Creative Photos | Getty ImagesGold's wild price swings in recent weeks are increasingly being linked to speculative trading in China by some analysts, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attributing the heightened volatility to \"unruly\" Chinese activity.Gold prices jumped to a record high of $5,594 per ounce on Jan. 29 only to plummet nearly 10% the next day in its sharpest drop in decades. Since then, the yellow metal has struggled to consistently stay above the 5,000 level.While broader factors such as U.S. interest-rate expectations and geopolitical tensions continuing to drive bullion demand, some analysts believe Chinese retail and institutional investors are playing an outsized role in driving volatility. Bessent, who spoke on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures, described the move bluntly. \"The gold move thing, things have gotten a little unruly in China … They are having to tighten margin requirements. So gold looks to me kind of like a classical, speculative blowoff.\"Surging activity in gold futures and exchange-traded funds, rising use of leverage despite repeated margin hikes appear be behind gold's choppy trade, market watchers echoed.China has been the \"dominant driver\" impacting prices of precious metals this time, said Nicky Shiels, head of research and metals strategy at MKS Pamp. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold prices in the past year\"That's been driven by a mix of speculative inflows, retail and institutional, through a mix of ETFs, physical bars and futures positioning,\" she told CNBC.Chinese gold-backed ETF holdings have more than doubled since the start of 2025, according to data provided by Capital Economics, while gold futures trading activity has picked up sharply in recent months. \"This [volaitilty] is partly because of growing access to gold-linked financial products like futures contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in China,\" said Hamad Hussain, economist at Capital Economics. \"What's more, there are signs of increasing amounts of leverage in China's gold market too, which can lead to significant gold price volatility.\"Volumes on the Shanghai Futures Exchange have surged, with year-to-date average approaching 540 tons per day, Ray Jia, research head APAC ex‑India and trade engagement deputy head China at World Gold Council, told CNBC. That rise builds on the record trading volume in 2025 at 457 tons a day on average.Regulators have taken notice, with the Shanghai Gold Exchange repeatedly raising margin requirements to curb heightened volatility.\"The growing use of futures contracts and leverage to invest in gold is not typical of investors seeking a safe haven asset,\" Hussain said, warning that the recent buying \"implies that there may be a speculative bubble inflating.\"From safe haven to speculative trade?The surge in participation reflects both structural anxieties and tactical positioning.\"Chinese people have limited access to the financial market. They have to invest in property, deposits etc. Gold is a good alternative when housing prices fall and deposit rate low at 1%,\" said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ Research.Currently gold accounts for about 1% of Chinese household assets, according to data from ANZ Research. Xing expects that to rise to 5% in the near future, especially amid depressed real estate prices and deposit rates hovering near historic lows. \"People believe gold can play a role of insurance.\"For Beijing, the motive is also strategic amid a wider push away from the dollar, he noted.\"The government is pushing de-dollarization to protect themselves from economic coercion from the U.S., said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director at the China Market Research Group.\"Chinese retail investors and the government are driving higher prices in gold as they search for higher returns and safe havens,\" he said.According to official data released by the U.S. Treasury Department, China's U.S. Treasury holdings have declined to $682 billion in November 2025, down 11% year on year. The People's Bank of China, meanwhile, has expanded its gold reserves for 15 consecutive months through January, reportedly taking holdings to roughly 2,300 tons. \"Alongside a flight to safety, there may also be a gold bubble inflating in China,\" said Capital Economics' Hussain.

    "body": "watch nowRivian Automotive on Thursday beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations and said it's targeting a significant increase in vehicle deliveries this year, but the automaker also cautioned that it will continue losing money as it launches its crucial R2 next-generation vehicle.Rivian's 2026 guidance includes increasing vehicle deliveries to between 62,000 and 67,000 units, which would be up by 47% to 59% compared with 2025. That increase is expected to be assisted by the launch of the R2 SUV during the second quarter.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Thursday that the R2 is expected to be the \"majority of the volume\" of the business by the end of 2027, as it ramps up production at its sole factory in Normal, Illinois.The electric vehicle maker also said it expects adjusted pre-tax losses for 2026 of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion and capital expenditures between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. That compares with nearly $2.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax losses and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures last year.Scaringe described 2025 to investors Thursday as a \"foundational year\" for Rivian, while saying 2026 will mark \"an inflection point\" for the company.Shares of Rivian were up more than 15% during after-hours trading Thursday after closing at $14, down roughly 5%.watch nowHere's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 68 cents expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.26 billion expectedRivian's full-year 2025 revenue, including $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter, was up 8% compared with $4.97 billion in 2024.The company was able to achieve its first annual gross profit, which is closely watched by investors, of $144 million in 2025, including $120 million during the fourth quarter. That was driven by its software and services joint venture with Volkswagen offsetting $432 million in losses for its automotive business last year.This year's gross profit may not be as fruitful, with Rivian CFO Claire McDonough describing it as a \"transition year\" as it ramps up R2 production.Investors view gross profit as a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest and taxes.Rivian's net loss last year was $3.6 billion, an improvement from a loss of $4.75 billion in 2024. That includes an $804 million loss during the fourth quarter, accelerated by a decrease in earnings from the sale of regulatory credits, which was expected after changes by the Trump administration to federal fuel economy and emissions standards.Rivian ended the fourth quarter with $6.59 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.It's needed capital for Rivian. This year is a crucial one for the automaker as it attempts to deliver on promises of technological advancements and improved profitability with the R2. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.Rivian said the R2 is expected to initially be produced by one plant shift, followed by a second shift by the end of this year. The company said additional R2 details by model such as pricing, options and more will be available on March 12.Rivian has made important strides with its first-generation R1 pickup and SUV, but the market for such pricey EVs, which both start in the $70,000s, has slowed. It also continues to produce an all-electric delivery van, historically purchased by its largest shareholder, Amazon.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Department of Homeland Security is barreling toward a shutdown starting this weekend after Senate Democrats and the White House on Thursday failed to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement restrictions.A bill already approved by the House of Representatives, which would fund DHS through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, failed on Thursday to clear a procedural hurdle in the Senate, meaning time will run out before a shutdown can be avoided.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, shortly after that vote also objected to immediately considering what would have been the second two-week stopgap funding for DHS while negotiations continue.Congress went into a weeklong recess after Murphy's objection, making a shutdown set to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday.The looming shutdown comes as Democratic senators continue to negotiate directly with the White House and President Donald Trump on a deal that could unlock DHS funding. Democrats want new restrictions on immigration officers, citing the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January by federal agents who were there to conduct immigration enforcement.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

The TSA shutdown could affect travelers going through airport security, especially if agents miss their paychecks in early March.\"DHS essential missions and functions will continue as they do during every shutdown,\" a DHS spokesperson told CNBC. \"However, during a shutdown, many employees will be forced to work without pay, putting strain on the frontline defenders of our nation.\"So far, Democrats and the White House appear far apart on their terms for a deal to restore full funding to DHS.\"Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference after Thursday's vote.Schumer threw cold water on the White House's latest offer. \"Their proposal is not serious,\" Schumer said. He declined to detail the sticking points. Democrats are pushing for a series of changes at DHS. They want a requirement for agents to wear body cameras, a bar on agents wearing masks and a requirement for judicial warrants for arrests. The Democrats also want an end to \"roving patrols,\" a term they have used to describe the administration's dragnet immigration operations. A senior White House official said the judicial warrants are a \"particularly challenging aspect,\" according to MS Now. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration won't accept changes that affect its ability to deploy its immigration enforcement agenda.If a deal is reached, both chambers of Congress could come back from their recess and pass it. But it's far from clear that a deal will be clinched over the next week.And, many lawmakers are set to be in Germany then for the Munich Security Conference. \"If and when there's a breakthrough, we'll make sure people are here to vote on it,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Airbnb were up about 2% in extended trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for revenue and offered rosy guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 66 cents expectedRevenue: $2.78 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedFor the current period, Airbnb said it expects to report revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.53 billion for the quarter, according to LSEG. The company said it expects full-year revenue growth of \"at least low double digits.\" Analysts were expecting 10.2% growth.Airbnb's revenue increased 12% during the fourth quarter from $2.48 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb has beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for 20 of the past 21 quarters, according to FactSet.The company reported net income of $341 million, or 56 cents per share, down from $461 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Airbnb attributed the lower figure to $90 million of non-income tax matters and planned investments in new growth and policy initiatives, according to a release.  Airbnb said it finished 2025 with \"strong momentum,\" and that its results reflect the strength of its core business. The company connects users who are willing to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for places to stay.

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.David A. Grogen | CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks.Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion.Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. The company said there were no share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%.Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year.Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire Hathaway class A shares year to dateThe 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026.The Omaha-based conglomerate's shares have tumbled double digits from all-time highs following the announcement. The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire's unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

    "body": "Evolve Bank CEO Bob Hartheimer booking photo.Source: Shelby County JailBob Hartheimer, CEO of Tennessee's Evolve Bank & Trust, was fired after U.S. law enforcement officials caught him propositioning a law enforcement officer posing as a 15-year-old boy on gay dating app Grindr.On Oct. 19, an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation logged onto Grindr while pretending to be a teen boy, and a user called \"Tomm\" wrote a message to that person saying, \"Hey any chance u would hu with an older and chill guy,\" according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was unsealed on Tuesday.The two discussed getting together in person later in the week, according to the affidavit. On Snapchat, they talked about the sex acts they might perform. \"Tomm\" asked for a photo of the \"boy\" without shorts on, and he also sent the undercover agent a picture of himself naked. The FBI was able to obtain an IP address for \"Tomm\" from Snapchat, as well as an address from Comcast, the affidavit showed.Hartheimer was arrested in Memphis on Oct. 23 for attempted production of child pornography and transfer of obscene material to a minor, according to a warrant.An Evolve spokesperson and Blake Ballin, a lawyer representing Hartheimer, told CNBC on Saturday that Evolve has fired the CEO.\"Bob's family is aware of the charges,\" Ballin wrote in an email. \"His family loves and supports him and requests privacy during this difficult period in their lives. We have no further comment at this time.\"The Wall Street Journal reported on Hartheimer's firing from Evolve Bank on Friday. Evolve said its finance chief, Mark Mosteller, and its general counsel, Joelle Weltzin, will be in charge of the bank's operations, as they were before the bank hired Hartheimer in August.\"We are in close contact with the U.S. Attorney's office and have been assured that this is a personal matter and does not relate to the Bank or its operations in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.Last year, Evolve was caught up in the bankruptcy of financial technology startup Synapse, which cut off access to a system for handling transactions and account details. Fintech apps such as Yotta worked with Evolve and other banks, with Synapse acting as a middleman.Synapse's method of keeping app users' money in various banks, including Evolve, created accounting problems, and up to $96 million in deposits went missing. Thousands of Americans lost money, CNBC reported.In 2024, Evolve also suffered a cyberattack, during which hackers obtained customer information and demanded a ransom. The bank said it did not pay any ransom and the data was eventually posted online.\"This is a structural change, demonstrating our continued commitment to doing the hard work to earn back the trust of our customers, employees, regulators, and investors,\" Evolve said in an August statement announcing the selection of Hartheimer to replace CEO Scott Stafford, who retired after joining in 2004.The bank touted Hartheimer's experience as director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions, as well as his years as a regulatory consultant for fintech companies.\"Over the past four decades, I've led, turned around, and advised institutions across the financial landscape,\" Hartheimer wrote on his LinkedIn profile. The 100-year-old bank reported net losses for each of the first three quarters of 2025 after being profitable since 2003, according to data on file with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Hugh Son contributed reporting.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown, in Washington on Oct. 27, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageLayoffs are mounting, making it a 'challenging time to be unemployed': expertWhy travel insurance may not protect you in the government shutdownStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersNetherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia is at the heart of a standoff between the European Union, the U.S. and China that has triggered a near-crisis for global automakers.The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, in October, citing national security concerns. The move prompted Beijing to block Nexperia products from leaving China.Meetings are underway in Europe Saturday to attempt to defuse the escalating issue, and Chinese and U.S. authorities appear to be opening up a pathway for Nexperia's China-based operations to resume exporting critical automotive chips.Spokespeople for the White House and Nexperia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For now, however, the auto industry's supply chain still hangs in the balance.The dispute is threatening vehicle production worldwide as automakers warn of looming shortages of the chipmaker's components, which are critical to basic electrical functions in cars and challenging to replace on short notice.The battle has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese-linked tech firms from Western governments, including the U.S., which recently tightened export-control rules to limit technology transfers to Chinese-owned entities.Nexperia's owner, Wingtech, was put on a U.S. blacklist in December 2024 for its alleged role \"in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.\"Here's what to know about where the dispute stands, and why it matters. Why are Nexperia chips so important?Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year.In late October, automakers, such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz, sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia's chip exports are curtailed for long.While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight. What happened and where do things stand?In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property to another company it owned. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO, Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.But signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge.On Friday, reports said the U.S. plans to announce that Nexperia will resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, citing sources familiar with the matter. And on Saturday, China said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban. Chinese officials did not specify what those exemptions could entail.\"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,\" The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. If finalized, the exemptions could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader dispute over ownership, technology control and security oversight remains unresolved.",

    "body": "Ellen and Edward earn $28,000 a month, or an annual income of around $336,000 a year — more than triple their home state of Hawaii's median household income.But their high income doesn't prevent the couple from having constant financial disagreements, they told money expert, author and self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi on a recent episode of his Money for Couples podcast. Their last names were not used.Edward is terrified of ever returning to a poor financial situation similar to what he grew up in, while Ellen wants the freedom to reasonably spend their money without asking permission, they said.\"We are pretty financially well-off, and my brain does not compute that,\" Edward said on the podcast. \"Everything for me is a fire. A blown tire that's $200, $300 is a huge deal for me.\"It's not just emergencies, either. Edward oversees the all of couple's finances, and Ellen said she has to get his approval to buy virtually anything, even everyday beauty products or essentials like her prenatal vitamins.\"I feel like every time I ask for anything ... I have to over-explain why I need it for him to say yes,\" Ellen said. \"That constant, 'let me ask,' 'let's see what he says,' 'let me go in detail about why I need it,' is not a good feeling.\"Here's why their disagreements keep happening and Sethi's advice for how to manage money together better.How to manage money as a coupleEllen and Edward aren't bad partners, Sethi said. \"More likely, it's [a] bad structure\" for how they manage their money.The couple understands some basics of setting up a financial system that works for both of them, Sethi said, like the idea that they should have money dedicated to discretionary spending. However, Edward has been including items like prenatal vitamins in Ellen's discretionary spending, which Sethi strongly disagreed with.\"You don't just need a better budget. In fact, you probably don't even need a budget at all,\" Sethi said. \"You need a better system that is built together.\"For both partners to start feeling better about money and hopefully have fewer disagreements going forward, Sethi offered three pieces of advice — and anyone in a similar situation can follow them.1. Encourage your partner to engage with your finances In Edward and Ellen's situation, Edward handles all of the money, while Ellen is hands off. But as spouses and co-parents, both parties need to be treated as equals, Sethi said.Sethi suggests the partner who has more experience with managing the household budget — Edward, in this case — encourage the other to get involved. He recommends telling yourself from \"day one,\" \"I am not going to do this on my own. I want my partner to become good with money.\"2. Talk about money regularlyIn the past, Ellen has avoided money conversations because she felt like her needs were dismissed and she didn't understand where Edward was coming from when he worried about their finances. Having regular money conversations could help them clear up miscommunications going forward and allow both partners to feel empowered to make decisions on how the family spends their money, Sethi said. 3. Find a structure that works for both partnersEllen and Edward's current system, in which Edward approves all of the couple's spending, isn't working for both of them. Sethi suggested they adopt a new structure together. One idea: They could each have \"no-questions-asked money\" along with a joint account and work together to decide how much goes in each, Sethi said.Additionally, they should create some general rules for money in their relationship, such as a no-debt policy or a limit on how long to spend flipping a house, which has been a point of contention in the past.The couple needs to make a more concerted effort to work together and create a shared vision for their money or else they'll \"forever feel resentful, behind, insecure, unworthy, misaligned, sometimes even in danger around your finances,\" Sethi said. \"Money is important,\" he added. \"My wish for you is that you give it the attention and respect that it deserves.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay SNAP benefits that help feed 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.The oral ruling by Judge Jack McConnell, which directed that those food stamp benefits be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible,\" came a day before the administration was set to cut off the aid.\"There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\" McConnell said.McConnell's ruling came minutes after another federal judge in Boston, who is overseeing a separate but similar lawsuit, said that the group of states that are plaintiffs in that case is likely to prove that the suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits was \"unlawful.\"That judge, Indira Talwani, gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.President Donald Trump, in a statement on social media later Friday, said, \"Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.\"\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he said.Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case before McConnell argued at a court hearing Friday that the cutoff of SNAP benefits was an \"arbitrary and capricious act\" that had caused \"a crisis\" for the Americans who need food stamps to eat.A Justice Department lawyer argued that SNAP did not exist anymore because there were no congressionally appropriated funds for it as a result of the shutdown.The lawyer, Tyler Becker, also argued it was the administration's discretion whether to use up to $6 billion in contingency funds already set aside by Congress to continue issuing SNAP benefits.\"There is no SNAP program and, as a result, the government cannot just provide SNAP benefits,\" Becker said.\"A shutdown is not an emergency,\" said Becker, adding that if there was an emergency, it had been created by Congress in failing to appropriate money to keep the government operating.But McConnell told the administration to use the available contingency funds to maintain at least some of the SNAP benefits that are normally paid.The judge also said the administration needed to examine whether other federal funds would be available to keep the program operating in the absence of a funding bill by Congress.McConnell's ruling granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence against the Trump administration to maintain the benefits.White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, during an interview Friday afternoon with NBC News' \"Meet the Press Now,\" would not say whether the Trump administration would comply with either court ruling. Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO

Senate procedural vote\"Today's ruling is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table,\" the coalition of plaintiffs said in a statement.\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon,\" the coalition said. \"This victory is about more than one program — it's about the American values of fairness, compassion, and accountability that hold our democracy together.\"The plaintiffs include a group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions and business organizations.The Boston judge, Talwani, in her separate order on Friday, said she was still considering the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to maintain the benefits.But she also ordered the administration to tell her by Monday if it would \"authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised both rulings.\"Good,\" Schumer wrote in a post on the social media site X.\"Trump's decision to cut off SNAP was vindictive and heartless,\" Schumer wrote.\"He was trying to manufacture a hunger crisis so he wouldn't have to fix healthcare. No president in American history has cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump during his own first term.\"Hassett, the National Economic Council director, blasted the rulings.\"We're about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture because of a liberal judge ruling that we disagree at the law on,\" Hassett said in an interview on Fox News.\"But then we don't have our emergency funds in case we have a hurricane or we have an emergency -- a food emergency,\" Hassett said. \"And so we've got to get the government open. We've got to do it as soon as possible. And the Democrats really don't have a plan.\"The Trump administration blames Senate Democrats for the shutdown, given their refusal to vote for a short-term funding bill proposed by House Republicans, which does not include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats insist on.",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025. Microsoft Corp., determined to hold its ground in artificial intelligence, will soon let consumers tailor the Copilot digital assistant to their own needs.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft will expand its employee base once again, CEO Satya Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on a podcast that aired on Friday.The software maker's workforce didn't budge in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June. It stood at 228,000, with multiple rounds of layoffs lowering the total number by at least 6,000. In July, Microsoft let go of another 9,000 workers.\"I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,\" Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. OpenAI, which has a broad partnership with Microsoft, introduced its ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Microsoft's headcount grew by 22% in the 2022 fiscal year.Employees will figure out how to do their jobs differently, Nadella said, adding that the company wants to ensure they can access artificial intelligence features in Microsoft 365 productivity software and the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant. Those services draw on AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI.\"It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,\" he said.A similar adjustment played out at corporations decades ago, Nadella said. To prepare forecasts, inter-office memos would circulate across multiple sites by fax, and then came email and Excel spreadsheets, he said.\"Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues and what have you,\" Nadella said.This week, Amazon, which is racing against Microsoft to rent out cloud infrastructure for running AI models, cut 14,000 corporate employees.Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, told workers in a memo that \"this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\"On the podcast, Nadella talked about a Microsoft executive who deals with networking fiber. As the company ramped up data center operations to meet rising cloud demand, the executive realized she wouldn't be able to hire all the people she thought she needed, and so she built AI agents to handle maintenance, Nadella said.\"That is an example of you, to your point, a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,\" Nadella told Gerstner, who is founder and CEO of technology investment firm Altimeter Capital.On Wednesday, Microsoft reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and showed the widest operating margin since 2002.WATCH: Microsoft earnings beat estimates, Azure revenue jumps 40%watch now",

    "body": "A UPS truck at the Palace Imports warehouse in Linden, New Jersey, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter a wave of big companies announcing steep job cuts, many laid-off workers may face a financially difficult and uncertain period ahead.Amazon said on Tuesday that it would eliminate around 14,000 corporate positions, and the United Parcel Service, or UPS, said it had reduced its operational workforce by 34,000 jobs this year. On Wednesday, General Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers, and Paramount terminated 1,000 people. The Trump administration has also threatened to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown, but those efforts have been blocked so far in the courts. \"Now is a particularly challenging time to be unemployed,\" said Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance.The Bureau of Labor Statistics didn't publish its monthly jobs report in October because of the government shutdown. But analysts have been worried about the state of the employment market for months.1. 'Immediately file' for unemploymentDespite the government shutdown, which began on Oct.1, states still have access to their state unemployment trust fund to pay out benefits, said Andrew Stettner, the director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation.\"Eventually they will run out of federal funds to pay the staff that process the benefits, but we've not heard of that happening yet,\" Stettner said.As a result, those who've lost their job should \"immediately file\" for unemployment insurance, Evermore said. Before you do so, you'll want to gather the following information: your pay over the last 18 months, names of previous employers during that period and their addresses, your Social Security number, state-issued identification and any documentation from your last company.If you live in one state and work in another, you'll want to apply for the jobless benefits in the state where you worked, experts say. On a DOL-sponsored website, you can find the contact information for state unemployment agencies.A sign is displayed at the U.S. Department of Labor Frances Perkins Building on June, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesState agencies should pay benefits within three weeks of your application, but delays have become more common since the pandemic, Evermore said.\"It's probably going to get worse as layoffs increase,\" she added.Maximum unemployment benefit amounts vary by state. For example, California's maximum weekly benefit is $450; in Florida, the cap is $275, Evermore said. In most states, claimants can get benefits for 26 weeks, she added — although the benefits last for just 12 weeks in some states, such as Florida.2. Find new health insuranceFor many workers, losing their jobs also means losing their health insurance.Your first step is to find out when your workplace insurance officially expires, said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at Rand Corporation. Some companies provide additional months of coverage under their plan after a layoff.Once your coverage lapses, you may be offered the chance to continue it under COBRA, shorthand for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, said Caitlin Donovan, a spokeswoman for the Patient Advocate Foundation.The option is \"cost-prohibitive\" for many people, Donovan said, because it requires them to pay the full premium, including the portion their company was previously paying. But if you can afford the price tag, it'll cause the least disruption to your coverage. COBRA is usually available for between 18 months to 36 months, according to the Department of Labor.Now is a particularly challenging time to be unemployed.Michele Evermoresenior fellow at the National Academy of Social InsuranceOther options for getting new health insurance include enrolling in a spouse's plan or seeking subsidized coverage on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace or through Medicaid, Eibner said. Those who've lost their employer health benefits typically have 60 days to sign up for an ACA Marketplace plan, Eibner added. (Open enrollment on the marketplace for 2026 starts on Nov. 1 in most states.)At the heart of the current stalemate in Washington is whether or not to extend Covid-era enhanced tax credits for ACA marketplace enrollees. Those enhanced subsidies make health insurance premiums cheaper for tens of millions of Americans. Without that aid being extended, many people will see higher prices for marketplace coverage in 2026.\"However, the tax credits aren't going away completely,\" Eibner said. \"They are just reverting to the original levels put into place under the Affordable Care Act.\"Medicaid is the cheapest health-care option and may actually cost you close to nothing, experts said. Eligibility is based in part on your current income, which may allow many newly unemployed workers to qualify — although jobless benefits may have an impact.3. Check on your workplace retirement accountIf your company offered a retirement account, you'll need to decide what to do with that nest egg now.You may be able to simply leave the money in the account, even though you won't be able to contribute to it anymore or benefit from any employer match.\"This is a great option, especially if the funds in the account are strong and if the employee needs time to focus on other things,\" said Dana Levit, a certified financial planner and the owner of Paragon Financial Advisors in the Boston area.An exception: If you have less than $5,000 in your workplace retirement account, your employer may require that you move the funds.You may also be able to transfer your funds without taxation or penalties to another qualified retirement plan, including a 401(k) at your next company if that's allowed, or to an individual retirement account, Levit said. If your former employer isn't forcing a transfer, there's no need to rush into this decision.While cashing out your 401(k) is another option, it's not a desirable one, Levit said: \"The distribution is taxable as ordinary income,\" and \"depending on the employee's age, there could also be penalties for an 'early withdrawal.'\"watch nowLaid-off workers who have an outstanding loan from their 401(k) may face an extra headache, Levit said.\"401(k) loans are typically due in full at termination,\" she said. \"If they are not repaid, the outstanding loan will be considered a taxable distribution subject to ordinary income taxes and potentially penalties.\"But it's worth talking to your plan administrator and learning what your options are, Levit added: \"Some have flexibility about continuing payments even after termination.\"4. Stay on top of student loans, other debtPeople who've lost a job and are worried about their student loan bill have options, too. You can enroll in an income-driven repayment plan that sets your monthly payment based on your earnings and submit proof that you've lost your job; while unemployment benefits will count as income, you're likely to get a low payment and some may not owe anything under their plan's terms.The U.S. Department of Education also offers an Unemployment Deferment, in which you can possibly pause your payments for up to three years after a job loss. Some student loans will still accrue interest during the payment pause, while others will not.During a period of joblessness, you should ask other lenders \"for a break,\" said Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate.\"Many lenders have hardship programs that allow you to skip a payment or rearrange a due date,\" Rossman said. \"Lenders are often willing to work with you, especially if it's something temporary like a government shutdown, job loss or natural disaster.\"If you can manage it, making at least the minimum payments on all of your debts will avoid the start of any collection activity and possible risks to your credit, Rossman added.On top of taking care of your finances, it's also important to tend to your mental health after a job loss, Evermore said. That might mean sharing what you're going through with others, including family, friends and a therapist.\"Unemployment is one of the most stressful things that can happen to a person, so be mindful of the fact that you are not alone,\" Evermore said. \"There are people who want to help you through this challenging time.\"",

But Musk is again promising that a new one is on the way.In a discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan that was published on Friday, Musk was asked about the long-delayed vehicle. He provided a sense of timing but declined to share updated technical or design details.\"I can't do the unveil before the unveil,\" Musk said. As he's said before, Musk claimed the new Roadster \"has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.\"Tesla is aiming to show off the updated Roadster to fans and investors \"hopefully before the end of the year,\" Musk said.Musk's comments come a day after former close friend Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, posted on X that he tried to cancel his Roadster reservation from 2018 and get his deposit refunded. He shared a screenshot showing that his email to the company had bounced back.\"I really was excited for the car!\" Altman wrote. \"And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.\"Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, is in a heated legal dispute with Altman and now runs competing artificial intelligence startup xAI.Patrick George, editor-in-chief at InsideEVs and a long-time industry observer, told CNBC on Friday that the Roadster \"has been MIA for years.\"\"The only thing I can think of that would make Musk start talking about this again is that Sam Altman at OpenAI, who is sort of his arch-rival, just said recently that he was trying to cancel his Roadster reservation which he has held since 2018,\" George said.Earlier this year, the popular gadget and autos reviewer Marques Brownlee discussed the arduous process of cancelling his own Roadster reservation in an interview with Waveform Podcast.The Roadster is a high end, low-volume model, something meant to challenge vehicles like BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme, which was recently crowned the world's fastest production car.Musk faces a major Tesla shareholder vote next week, as he and the board are asking investors to approve a massive pay package.The pay plan would net Musk nearly $1 trillion in Tesla stock and would grow his stake to around 25%, depending on the company hitting various market valuations and other growth milestones.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Tesla Chair Robyn Denholmwatch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAlphabet's overall advertising sales for the third quarter came in at $74.18 billion, a 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. Third-quarter online ad sales for YouTube rose 15% to $10.26 billion.Microsoft's search and news advertising unit brought in $3.7 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter, a 14% increase from the $3.2 billion it recorded the previous year.Even if there's been some pullback in ad budgets due to economic uncertainty, it's likely that companies shifted some of that spending from traditional businesses like newspapers to digital ad platforms, said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of content at Emarketer.  \"I think what could be happening is more of a no-brainer,\" Goldman said. \"To put your money in social, and to put your money in retail media and to put your money in search ad spending.\"It wasn't just the megacaps that showed hefty online ad growth this week. Reddit on Thursday reported a 68% jump in third-quarter sales, soaring past analyst estimates. The company said global daily active uniques grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing estimates of 114 million.Snap and Pinterest are scheduled to report results next week. Going big on AIThe tech giants all made clear that they don't see any broader economic concerns that would warrant a reduction in their AI spending, and instead lifted their guidance for capital expenditures, despite concerns of a bubble.Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft collectively expect capex spending above $380 billion this year, which is still a fraction of the $1 trillion worth of data center and cloud computing deals that OpenAI has recently announced with its partners like Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.But while investors cheered Amazon and Google, they were less thrilled with Microsoft, and especially Meta.The Facebook parent's stock tanked 11% on Thursday after the company said it would raise the low end of its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion from the prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion.Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Meta stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, because they said it's less obvious how the social media company will benefit from its AI investments relative to its big tech rivals that also operate cloud computing services.\"Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending,\" the Oppenheimer analysts wrote, contrasting the company's big AI spending related to its Superintelligence Labs to its money-losing Reality Labs division, which makes virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.watch nowSusan Li, Meta's finance chief, said Wednesday during a follow-up earnings call that it's important for the company to invest in AI-related data center and third-party cloud computing services or risk falling behind, echoing similar comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"The highest priority for the company is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI,\" Li said. \"That means that I think for the immediate period of time ahead of us, we could see some financial pressure during which our operating profit could be lumpy.\"Meta has continued to point to how its AI investments are improving its online advertising business, but it's having a more difficult time showing how that spending will benefit the company in the future, Enberg said.\"I think part of that is that we've heard the story now quarter after quarter that it is able to integrate AI into its ad business and use that as a growth engine,\" Enberg said.  \"What comes next is harder to articulate, and far less tangible for investors and other people who follow the space.\"Still, Meta is experiencing some growth in new products like the Meta AI app that contains the Vibes AI-powered short video service, Goldman said.The company can also still expand more into subscriptions or even potentially offer enterprise AI services to sell to corporations, which is \"an area that they haven't played at all,\" he said.For now, Meta's digital advertising unit remains its core business, and just like previous quarters, it's unclear how the economy will impact ad budgets.With the holiday season approaching, all eyes will be focused on whether the lingering economic concerns or tariff-related price hikes lead to consumers curbing their spending, which could impact corporate marketing campaigns.  \"The next test will be when we get to the Black Friday numbers,\" Goldman said. \"Are those going to be below expectations?\"WATCH: Big tech earnings tell you \"these are the companies you want to own.\" watch now",

The decision took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%, a level that's still far above zero.Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield ticked back above 4% following the latest decision. The yield has dropped by almost 2% over the past month and is down about 11% so far this year.Kelly, whose firm specializes in fixed-income exchange-traded funds, finds bonds are evolving into an active source of diversification, income and tactical opportunity. Kelly highlights emerging market debt as a standout performer.\"[It's] one of the top returning asset classes in the fixed income market this year,\" he noted.Kelly finds interest is also growing in private credit ETFs, which allow investors to tap into institutional-style yield with daily liquidity.\"I don't know if that is something you would necessarily refer to as plain vanilla, but there is a lot of interest in that subset of the fixed income asset class to be in an ETF wrapper for clients,\" said Kelly. \"We do have a private credit ETF product in the market now. We've got one in registration.\"",

    "body": "MOSCOW, RUSSIA - SEPTEMBER 21: Shaman of Russia performs during the new global song competition called Intervision, initially positioned as a response to the long-running European Eurovision music contest, in Moscow, Russia on September 21, 2025. (Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSince Russia found itself cast out of the Western cultural and sporting sphere following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it has tried in earnest to create something of a \"parallel world\" of events and institutions that could act as substitutes.After launching the war against its neighbor in 2022, Russia was banned from participating in the Olympic Games, a competition in which it had traditionally fared well, although its success was often accompanied by various doping scandals. It was also barred from more light-hearted cultural events, such as the Eurovision Song Contest.Russia has sought to turn its banishment to its advantage, however, looking to replace such events with home-grown versions.While Russians understand that such substitutes are not the genuine articles, many have seen efforts to recreate sporting and cultural events as a patriotic effort to rekindle Russia's Soviet-era, which Russian President Vladimir Putin frequently references with nostalgia.\"The majority of Russians believe that Russia was unfairly excluded from most of the international events, so these substitutes make sense in terms of providing some alternative,\" according to Anton Barbashin, a Russian political analyst and editorial director of the journal Riddle, told CNBC Thursday.\"[They have a kind of attitude that they're] 'better than nothing' but of course only a minority of people would treat them as a real deal. For the older generation, it is a reminder of Soviet-organized events. Often Putin is framing them in this way as well — as a revival of old traditions,\" Barbashin said by email.Barbashin characterized Russia's strategy of \"import-substitution\" as one that was done out of \"pure necessity.\"Soviet revival?The Kremlin has frequently described its isolation from the West as \"Russophobic\" and sought to position itself as the victim of Western hegemony, while calling for a new \"global order.\"The war in Ukraine has certainly led to Russia to look beyond the West to foster economic and cultural ties, with varying degrees of success.Russia said in May 2023 that it was going to create an alternative to the Olympic Games known as the \"World Friendship Games\" but it announced in late 2024 that it was postponing the event indefinitely, without providing a reason.The postponement came after heavy criticism from the International Olympic Committee, which said the games were a \"cynical attempt\" to politicize sport and urged athletes to boycott the event.An event that ostensibly had more success was Russia's relaunch, this September, of the Soviet-era Intervision Song Contest. An alternative to the popular European event Eurovision, Russia said its version of the contest would foster cultural ties between countries that were outside the West.There was some bemusement over the contest among commentators, and critics said it was a propaganda tool, but the competition attracted singers from 23 countries (notably, the U.S.' original entrant pulled out of the contest at the last minute) and the competition was won by Vietnam's Duc Phuc.Russia's President Vladimir Putin's image is displayed on a screen of the main stage of the Intervision Song Contest at the Live Arena in Moscow on September 20, 2025.           Olesya Kurpyayeva | Afp | Getty ImagesSuch events were not intended to try to replace international ones that Russia can no longer participate in, one Russian analyst said, but were meant to be alternatives.\"It is true that [Russian substitute events] cannot replace genuine international events, nor is that its purpose, but it is supposed to create alternative platforms — a space where Russia can operate and develop something that is 'friendly' yet still international,\" Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political analyst and founder of the political analysis firm R. Politik, told CNBC Thursday.\"It is based on the idea of Western decline and the enforcement of multipolarity. Domestically, it carries significant meaning in terms of managing resources, political dividends, and visibility,\" Stanovaya said.Does Russia want back in?The war in Ukraine is ongoing, with little sign that Russia wants to re-engage with the West, particularly when it comes to Kyiv, despite U.S. President Donald Trump's calls for a ceasefire and for Moscow to come to the negotiating table.The Kremlin has said it wants peace but has demanded that Ukraine cede partially Russian-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine to Russia, which Kyiv refuses to do.Despite the ongoing war, and anti-Western rhetoric that has become embedded in Kremlin and state media commentary, Russia is likely to be ready and willing to participate in future global cultural and sporting events should circumstances change.Russian President Vladimir Putin passes symbolic FIFA World Cup Baton to Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani (not pictured) during the ceremony at the Kremlin, in Moscow, Russia, July,15,2018. Qatar is hosting FIFA World Cup in 2022.Mikhail Svetlov | Getty Images\"We've seen many times before that it was highly important for Russia to be part of international, global events. The FIFA World Cup 2018 [hosted by Russia] was the highest moment in Russian history for that,\" Barbashin said, adding that \"it matters greatly for the people.\"Asked if Russia would, once the war in Ukraine ends, like to participate once again in global events, Barbashin was emphatic:\"Absolutely, [at the] first chance Russia has. Russia's entire conversation has always been, and is with, the West. The swing back to it is inevitable,\" he said.",

A six-week shutdown would cost the economy $11 billion, and an eight-week shutdown would cost $14 billion, according to CBO estimates.Flights have been delayed at several U.S. airports over the past month but the severe disruptions that preceded the end of the longest-ever shutdown, between late 2018 and early 2019, have not occurred.— CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Onuma Inthapong | E+ | Getty ImagesCompany: Advanced Drainage Systems (WMS)Business: Advanced Drainage Systems is a manufacturer of stormwater and onsite wastewater solutions. The company and its subsidiary, Infiltrator Water Technologies, provide stormwater drainage and onsite wastewater products used in a wide variety of markets and applications, including commercial, residential, infrastructure and agriculture, while delivering customer service. Its pipe segment manufactures and markets thermoplastic corrugated pipe throughout the United States. Its infiltrator segment is a provider of plastic leachfield chambers and systems, septic tanks and accessories, primarily for use in residential applications. Its international segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside the United States, with a strategy focused on its owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through its joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Its Allied Products segment manufactures a range of products which are complementary to their pipe products.Stock Market Value: : $11.98 billion ($144.10 per share)Activist: Impactive CapitalOwnership: 2.14%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Impactive Capital is an activist hedge fund founded in 2018 by Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Alejandro Asmar. Impactive Capital is an active ESG investor that launched with a $250 million investment from CalSTRS and now has approximately $3 billion. In just seven years, they have made quite a name for themselves as AESG investors. Wolfe and Asmar realized that there was an opportunity to use tools, notably on the social and environmental side, to drive returns. Impactive focuses on positive systemic change to help build more competitive, sustainable businesses for the long run. Impactive will use traditional operational, financial and strategic tools that activists use, but will also implement ESG change that they believe is material to the business and drives profitability of the company and shareholder value. Impactive looks for high quality businesses that are usually complex and mispriced, where they can underwrite a minimum of a high teens or low 20% internal rate of return over a three- to five-year holding period, and have active engagement with management to set up multiple ways to win.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Impactive said they had taken a position in Advanced Drainage Systems.Behind the scenesAdvanced Drainage Systems is the market share leader in plastic stormwater and onsite septic wastewater management solutions. The company is a pioneer in the development and manufacturing of plastic drainage products, primarily utilizing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene. Recycled materials made up 46% of WMS' purchased inputs in fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest recyclers in North America. The company has three primary business lines: (i) Pipe - storm and drainage pipe, 56% of FY25 revenue; (ii) Allied Products - complementary products to its pipe offerings like storm chambers, structures and fittings, 26%; and (iii) Infiltrator - chambers, tanks and advanced wastewater treatment solutions, 18%. Between its three segments, the company has a $15 billion addressable market and is the clear industry leader with 75% to 95% market share across its segments.There is a lot to like about WMS, as it is an extremely high-quality and well-run company with a long history of compounding growth and secular tailwinds. As a result, WMS has an impressive track record, having grown earnings per share almost 10x since its initial public offering, and has a 28% EPS compound annual growth rate with returns on invested capital consistently above 20%. Management is also very focused on shareholder value and are great capital allocators, increasing dividends and launching buybacks in most years where it does not see a compelling M&A opportunity. Despite this, the company's share price performance has been lackluster over the past 1- and 3-year periods, underperforming the Russell 2000, and its stock has re-rated down to a P/E multiple in the low-to-mid 20s. The reason for this is twofold: investor fears regarding the cyclicality of construction spending and margin compression. However, Impactive Capital believes that both concerns appear to be overblown or misplaced and that management has built this business to protect its top line from market cyclicality and make margin expansion structural, not cyclical. As to the cyclicality of construction spending, construction spending is down 3% year to date as higher interest rates and affordability concerns have dampened residential and non-residential construction spending, setting this up to be the worst year for construction in the past two decades aside from the global financial crisis. But company revenue has not been declining and is not expected to decline for several reasons. First, plastic pipes have been stealing market share from concrete and steel. Only about 20% of the market in 2010, plastic now exceeds 40% due to it being 20% cheaper than alternatives and offering superior performance. Second, with the 2019 acquisition of Infiltrator and the upcoming acquisition of National Diversified Sales, WMS has increased its exposure to the residential repair and remodel end-market, adding resiliency to its revenue streams. This should also make WMS a natural beneficiary of the reversion in existing home sales, which are currently at a 15-year low. Third, billion-dollar storm events have quintupled since the 1980s, necessitating increased investment in resiliency and more complex stormwater infrastructure. The company also has a wide moat, enabled by its high brand loyalty from contractors, its vertical integration and excellent distribution network. As for margin concerns, there are fears that weakness in construction will lead to margin compression. However, this is something else that management has taken a lot of steps and adopted many initiatives to avoid. Over the past six years, the company has been diversifying its business toward its higher-margin Allied Product and Infiltrator offerings, both of which have adjusted operating margins in the mid-50s, whereas pipe is around 30%. Additionally, one of its largest input costs are oil and resin, and WMS has a unique way to mitigate these costs. The company toggles between recycled and virgin resins depending on the price of oil. So, when oil spikes, they use recycled resin, and when it drops, they switch to virgin resin and capture better margins. WMS is the only one of its competitors who can do this at scale. Moreover, when construction is weak, oil and resin prices tend to decline. So, loss to the top line can be made up on the bottom line as the decline in resin prices is more than enough to offset end-market weaknesses (i.e., construction spending is down about 3% YTD, resin prices are down 15% to 20%). As a result, pipe and Allied Products adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded by about 8 percentage points since 2020, but some fear that this will eventually normalize.However, Impactive believes that this shift is structural, not cyclical and WMS will not only avoid margin compression but could see gross margin expand by 100 bps over the next 12-24 months; something that is not factored into forward consensus estimates.As a result of this confluence of factors, Impactive models that WMS will return to mid-teens EPS growth and projects a base case three-year total return and IRR of 69% and 19%, respectively, and an upside case of 146% and 34%, respectively.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Photo illustration of the YouTube TV logo displayed on a smartphone, with the YouTube logo in the background.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesDisney content, including channels like ABC and ESPN, was removed from Google's YouTube TV overnight after the two companies failed to renew a streaming contract. \"Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal, and starting today, Disney programming will not be available on YouTube TV,\" the platform said in a statement.More than 20 channels would be removed from YouTube TV, the company said, adding if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company would offer users a $20 credit. Affected networks include ESPN and its sister sports networks, ABC, FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. Disney said in a statement, \"Google's YouTube TV has chosen to deny their subscribers the content they value most by refusing to pay fair rates for our channels, including ESPN and ABC.\"Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro sent a memo to all Disney employees Friday, noting that YouTube TV also \"deleted all [Disney] previously recorded shows and events from their subscribers' libraries\" in addition to failing to strike a deal.\"Their actions make clear how little regard they have for their customers and are consistent with an attitude which has been prevalent throughout our negotiations — YouTube TV and its owner, Google, are not interested in achieving a fair deal with us,\" wrote Walden, Bergman and Pitaro. \"Instead, they want to use their power and extraordinary resources to eliminate competition and devalue the very content that helped them build their service.\"The two sides had been engaged in negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before their existing contract expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET. YouTube TV subscribers risk losing access to college football if a deal isn't struck by Saturday morning and \"Monday Night Football\" if programming isn't returned by the start of next week.Disney warned last week it could result in a content blackout.In a Thursday statement on its official blog, YouTube argued Disney had \"used the threat of a blackout on YouTube TV as a negotiating tactic to force deal terms that would raise prices on our customers,\" and that Disney was now following through on that threat.\"We will not agree to terms that disadvantage our members while benefiting Disney's own live TV products,\" YouTube TV said in a post on its help center webpage. Disney's live TV offerings include Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels and has been engaged in several tense negotiations over contract renewals in recent months.Last month, NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement after a temporary extension, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.CNBC reported last week that Disney was willing to offer YouTube TV a distribution agreement that would give some subscribers access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for no extra charge. Disney has previously offered similar terms to Charter, the largest U.S. pay TV provider by subscribers.However, YouTube asked for Disney's streaming content to be ingested into YouTube TV, giving customers the ability to view programming on Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ without leaving the platform, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.Disney had rejected that proposal and had no plans to budge on the request, people familiar with the company's thinking told CNBC. Disney has no interest in adding its streaming services to YouTube Primetime Channels, the people said.The recent clash between Disney and YouTube has an added twist, after YouTube hired former Disney distribution executive Justin Connolly earlier this year, prompting Disney to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit.Connolly has recused himself from the discussions, CNBC previously reported, according to the people familiar with the process. Disney and YouTube reportedly settled the lawsuit.YouTube is the top U.S. media distributor by audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen. It is also on track to be the biggest media company by revenue in 2025, beating Disney, analysts at MoffettNathanson told CNBC.— CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV last month before those companies reached an agreement.",

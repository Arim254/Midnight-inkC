    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "In an aerial view, two-story single family homes line the streets on Jan. 14, 2026 in Thousand Oaks, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHouse lawmakers on Monday approved a package of bills aimed at increasing housing affordability by giving builders and local governments incentives to boost construction by reducing regulations around home construction. The legislation gained strong bipartisan support, with the House voting 390-9 in favor. A similar Senate counterpart passed last year, also with bipartisan votes. That, as well as President Donald Trump's focus on housing affordability, means the measure has momentum to become law before the end of the year. \"Nothing's more personal to Americans than their opportunity to have a home,\" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told reporters on Monday. \"When you ask people what is central to their goals in life, mom and dad are working 55 hours a week and overtime and all these other things ... the idea is, how do we get into a house?\"The bill includes numerous provisions, including cutting housing and environmental regulations around constructing homes. Local communities could get grants to make it easier for builders by offering pre-reviewed housing designs, streamlining construction or housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also develop best-practices for zoning guidelines. Definitions around manufactured and modular housing would be updated to encourage more factory-built homes, which can be constructed in a fraction of the time compared to more traditional house-building methods.Community banks would also get a boost through the bill. One change would allow banks to take more custodial and reciprocal deposits, which could help banks provide more mortgages for potential homeowners. Other changes would make it easier to start new banks and change how the FDIC looks at banking mergers. The Senate bill doesn't include many of the provisions on community banks, and would create more programs compared to the House bill. The Senate passed its package last year as part of a larger defense measure, but the bill got significant bipartisan support as a standalone measure, including the backing of both Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.The bills have received an unusually high degree of bipartisan support. The Senate bill was advanced unanimously out of committee with all 24 senators supporting it. A House panel advanced its bill 50 to 1 in December.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who supported the bill, warned the legislation wouldn't be effective if housing programs remain underfunded.\"Policy reforms alone are not enough,\" Waters said. \"These programs must be funded if they are going to work.\"House Financial Services Chair French Hill, R-Ark., said getting a housing bill across the finish line is a \"shared goal\" between him and Scott. Hill said he will work with the Senate to see where they have common ground and get consensus on a bill that can get to Trump's desk. Flood said he is optimistic on getting passage this year. \"We are at a juncture to get something very big done here, and everybody wants to participate,\" he said. \"This isn't like we're pushing an agenda trying to talk people into something. White House has ideas. The Senate has ideas. The House has ideas.\"One thing not in the bill: formalizing Trump's proposed ban on large investors buying homes. Hill noted other lawmakers have introduced bills building on Trump's idea and said it could happen if there is a consensus in the Senate and House. ",

    "body": "From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, in a call two decades ago to a Florida police chief, bashed his former friend Jeffrey Epstein and called Epstein's  procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell, \"evil,\" the now-retired cop recounted to FBI agents in 2019, according to a document released by the Department of Justice.Trump called the then-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter \"to tell him 'thank goodness you' [are] stopping [Epstein], everyone has known he's been doing this,\" Reiter told the FBI in October 2019, according to the FBI document, known as a 302. Reiter's name is redacted from the 302. But the document identifies the interview subject as the person who had been Palm Beach's police chief at the time of the department's investigation of Epstein, who was Reiter.Reiter told the Miami Herald, which first reported the document, that Trump called him in 2006, after the police department's probe of Epstein became publicly known.The document came to light hours after Maxwell's lawyer called on Trump to grant her executive clemency, so that she could speak \"honestly\" about what she knows. Maxwell, earlier Monday, refused to testify to a House committee.Trump told Reiter that he had thrown Epstein out of his club, Mar-a-Lago, which is located in Palm Beach, the summary said.\"Trump told him [Reiter] people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting,\" according to the FBI's 302 summary of its interview with Reiter.\"Trump said Maxwell was Epstein's operative, 'she is evil and to focus on her,' \" the FBI said in the 302.U.S. President Donald Trump sits behind a bill he signed to end the partial government shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEpstein later pleaded guilty to Florida state charges in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, in exchange for avoiding federal criminal prosecution.Reiter's interview with the FBI in October 2019 came two months after Epstein killed himself in a New York federal jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.During the 2006 call, \"Trump told [Reiter] that he was around Epstein once when teenagers were present and Trump got the hell out of there,\" the summary said.\"Trump was one of the very first people to call when people found out that they were investigating Epstein,\" the summary said.In an April 2019 email released last year by House Democrats, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" according to a copy of that message purportedly between the two men.It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.The White House in November said, \"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees.\"The White House, when asked for comment on Monday night by CNBC about the FBI summary, referred questions to the Department of Justice.The DOJ said, \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the President contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"The summary is among millions of documents made public by the DOJ in late January that are related to Epstein and to Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.Ghislaine Maxwell and Donald Trump are shown in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. U.S. Justice Department | Via ReutersMaxwell on Monday appeared virtually before the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the Epstein case, but refused to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Her attorney, David Oscar Marcus, in a statement, said that Maxwell is willing to \"speak fully and honestly\" if Trump grants her executive clemency. Clemency can include a pardon, which would wipe away Maxwell's conviction, or commuting her sentence to allow her release from prison earlier than scheduled.\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" Marcus said. \"For example, both President Trump and President [Bill] Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.\"Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have been subpoenaed to testify to the Oversight Committee about Epstein. They are scheduled to be deposed there in late February.",

    "body": "Tesla electric vehicles outside the company's manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, Feb. 24, 2025.Mike Kai Chen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla Vice President Raj Jegannathan, a 13-year veteran of the automaker, announced his departure from the company on Monday in a LinkedIn post. Jegannathan's most recent role was vice president of information technology, AI infrastructure, business apps and information security. In his short LinkedIn post, Jegannathan wrote, \"The journey at Tesla has been one of continuous evolution.\"Last year, Jegannathan was tasked with leading the electric vehicle maker's sales team after previous North America sales leader Troy Jones was dismissed. Tesla's core automotive sales were in decline, with its brand reputation falling partly due to its aging lineup of EVs, along with a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk over his incendiary political rhetoric, work for the Trump administration and backing of far-right figures and parties around the world.Tesla and Jegannathan didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla's revenue for 2025 dropped 3%, declining for the first time on record. The company is under pressure to revitalize its EV sales, and to finally deliver its long-promised driverless systems and vehicles that can carry passengers around without requiring a human at the wheel. WATCH: Tesla stock still a generational opportunitywatch now",

    "body": "watch nowAt America's oldest bank, 134 new workers don't sleep or take sick days. They don't even have names.They're what BNY calls \"digital employees.\" They work side by side with humans. They have unique roles and are evaluated by how well they do them. Some of their jobs were done by people last year.\"The digital employee works 24/7, which is obviously very different to our human counterparts,\" said Rachel Lewis, who oversees nine digital employees in addition to thousands of humans as head of payment operations for BNY.  \"It's really focused on very specific repetitive tasks that allow our human employees to do much more human, intense, interesting-type roles.\"BNY employs 48,100 humans, down from about 53,400 in 2023, according to a recent earnings presentation. CFO Dermot McDonogh was asked on the firm's fourth-quarter analyst call last month what the 134 digital employees mean for cost savings at the firm. \"Our head count has trended down a little bit, but that's not really anything to do with AI yet,\" McDonogh said. \"We talk about, internally, AI is unlocking capacity. We don't think about it in the narrow definition of efficiency. It's all about growing with clients, increasing revenues and optimizing the potential for our employees.\" Across Wall Street, analysts and investors are starting to ask more questions about how the industry's expenses on AI will translate into higher efficiencies and greater returns. BNY spent $3.8 billion on technology in 2025, or about 19% of its revenue. That's the highest proportion among its large-bank peers, according to data collated by CNBC.JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, BNY\"There's an AI arms race. The banks are part of that, said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. \"But you don't define success by who spends the most. You define success by who has the best results.\"\"It's a lot of 'spraying and praying' when it comes to spending on tech, generally,\" he said. However, BNY has been identified as one of the companies that could see the biggest benefits from AI. Goldman Sachs' research team screened the Russell 1000 for potential productivity improvements, based on labor costs and wage exposure to AI automation. The firm ranked BNY toward the top of that list, saying the bank could see a potential 19% boost to earnings per share. But in several conversations CNBC had with executives at BNY, they've been steadfast that the multitude of technology investments won't come at the expense of human employees.\"I wouldn't think about it that way,\" said Michelle O'Reilly, BNY global head of talent. \"I would think about it more as unlocking that productivity – enabling all employees to be productive.\"While the company is building more digital employees, it's also upskilling the human ones. Shortly after ChatGPT was released in late 2022, BNY set up its AI Hub. \"That's when we really doubled down and realized that this would be transformational for the bank,\" said Leigh-Ann Russell, BNY's chief information officer and global head of engineering. \"Our biggest focus initially was enablement – getting some training rolled out to every one of our employees at the bank.\"BNY built a platform it calls Eliza, which pulls in a variety of open-source, commercially available models that are integrated with the firm's internal data and compliance. Almost all of BNY's workforce has completed a 10-hour training for Eliza, and thousands more have taken it a step further through a multi-day AI bootcamp that can help non-engineers find creative ways to automate parts of their jobs. The name \"Eliza\" is a tribute to Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, the wife of the bank's founder and America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. \"Democratization of this technology is one of our sweet spots on how we feel like we've been successful so far,\" Russell said. \"I have this juxtaposition of this original history of this amazing 241-year institution and being at the forefront of AI, and I think that's just a lovely reminder of technology over the centuries.\"",

    "body": "watch nowTarget said Monday that it's stepping up store staffing, but eliminating about 500 jobs at distribution centers and regional offices as it tries to win back shoppers who have complained about sloppier shelves, out-of-stock items and longer checkout lines.In an internal employee memo obtained by CNBC, the big-box retailer said it's making changes to the way it runs and oversees stores to improve the customer experience, a top goal of new CEO Michael Fiddelke. To do that, Target said it will reduce the number of store districts — the geographic areas that its nearly 2,000 stores are broken into, which have dedicated staffing — and put money toward more hours for front-line store employees.As part of the changes, Target is laying off around 500 people, including about 100 at the store district level and about 400 across its supply chain sites, the internal email said.\"This change also fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores — primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,\" the email said. The email was written by Adrienne Costanzo, chief stores officer, and Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer, and sent to Target employees across its headquarters and store field teams on Monday afternoon.A Target spokesperson declined to specify the amount of additional investment planned for Target stores, but said the announcement will not change starting wages for store workers, which range from $15 to $24 per hour depending on the location. Read moreFor Target, the organizational shift marks one of the first changes under Fiddelke, formerly the company's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, who stepped into the top job on Feb. 1. Fiddelke took the helm as the company aims to get back to growth. Its annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and it cut 1,800 corporate roles last year in its first major layoff in a decade. Customers, vendors and investors say the company had gotten weaker in some of the key areas where it used to stand out. For example, some shoppers said Target had lost its edge with attentive customer service and trendy, fashion-forward merchandise that earned the company its \"Tarzhay\" nickname.The company has also faced backlash and boycotts from customers over a string of political and social stances over the past few years, including its decision to sell and then pull some Pride Month merchandise, its embrace of and reversal of major diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, most recently, for not speaking out against the surge of immigration enforcement in its hometown of Minneapolis. Along with Target's self-inflicted struggles, the company has faced stiffer competition from peers like Walmart and a tougher economic backdrop. Consumers have been more selective in recent years about discretionary purchases and impulse items — Target's sweet spot — while paying more for necessities like groceries and rent. In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said his leading priorities as CEO would be restoring Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.Yet he added that Target needs to simplify an operation that's become more complicated for store managers and store employees in recent years as they not only stock shelves, but also pick orders for curbside pickup or packing cardboard boxes headed to customers' homes.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest, and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said in the October interview. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well, and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"Last year, the company made another store-related change to try to clean up and smooth over its operations. Almost all of Target's online orders are fulfilled in stores, which has taken up more of employees' time and stores' back rooms. In response, the company shook up its online strategy, designating some stores as locations where employees pick and pack online orders to ship to customers' homes and dropping that altogether at other locations.Target is expected to share more details about its turnaround strategy, along with its holiday-quarter results and full-year forecast, on March 3. It will host an event for investors at its Minneapolis headquarters. ",

    "body": "Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks.DatabricksDatabricks said Monday it has raised $5 billion in funding and $2 billion in new debt capacity at a $134 billion valuation. The privately held data analytics software company also said that its annualized revenue exceeded $5.4 billion for the January quarter, up 65% year over year, while delivering free cash flow over the past year. That type of performance might whet the appetites of public market investors, who have not seen many new issuances of technology companies with high growth rates. Databricks is prepared to go public \"when the time is right,\" co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC in an interview. This year is shaping up to potentially feature notable tech IPOs. Fast-growing artificial intelligence labs Anthropic and OpenAI are also considering 2026 initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk said in December that his rocket company SpaceX could also go public this year.Like many other companies, Databricks is generating revenue from AI. The company helps its clients connect their data with AI models to launch custom agents, in addition to providing tools for storing, processing and querying data. AI products now generate $1.4 billion in annualized revenue, Databricks said in a statement. The pace of Databricks' overall expansion is accelerating — in June, the company forecast 50% growth.The company said in December that it was raising more than $4 billion in the round at a valuation of $134 billion. \"We weren't sure we're going to actually be able to raise all of the five,\" said Ghodsi, adding that there was heavy interest in recent weeks. He said it can take months for venture capital to reflect major changes in equity markets. Goldman Sachs, Glade Brook Capital, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman and the Qatar Investment Authority are among the investors in the new round. JPMorgan led the debt round, and now Databricks has billions in cash on hand.\"If this correction hasn't bottomed out yet, and it's just going to continue, we're just going to continue as a private company,\" Ghodsi said.Databricks is now larger than rival Snowflake, which reported $1.21 billion in revenue in the October quarter. Snowflake's market cap stands at about $58 billion. With the wide release of its Lakebase database last week, Databricks has expanded its market, challenging incumbents such as Oracle and SAP.Oracle and Snowflake shares both fell about 13% last week as software stocks took a step down across the market. That happened due to investors worrying that open-source plugins for Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI-powered productivity tool might pose new competitive challenges for public software companies. \"The correction is an overreaction, and you're going to see all these companies be around, and nobody's getting rid of them anytime soon,\" Ghodsi said. \"Their moat is shrinking.\"Founded in 2013, Databricks ranked No. 3 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.— CNBC's Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.WATCH: Trading the tech takedown with Altimeter's Brad Gerstnerwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included \"false or misleading\" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients.In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. The agency requested that the drugmaker take immediate action to address the violations, which could include ceasing all ads containing misleading claims. In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. \"We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation,\" Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. Bloomberg first reported on the FDA letter on Monday. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsIn the letter, the FDA said Novo's ad misleadingly suggests its pill offers superior benefits to other approved GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The agency said phrases used in the spot, including \"live lighter\" and \"a way forward,\" imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. The ad's statements \"misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated,\" the FDA said in the letter. The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections. ",

Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep besides the airport.On Monday, the flight attendants' union issued a vote of no confidence against Isom, saying \"this level of failure begins at the very top.\"And late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel in the island nation due to fuel shortages after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.Cuba's leadership said Sunday that the country will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, which cited two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" which required a national emergency declaration. Read moreThe U.S. president said Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations and communist leadership destabilize the region \"through migration and violence.\" As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Russia: Fuel situation in Cuba is 'critical'Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was \"truly critical\" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.Pedestrians walk past the Habana Libre hotel, formerly the Habana Hilton, in Havana on Feb. 2, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the \"strongest possible terms.\"In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to \"blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.\"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowMeta is back in court, but this time it's a lone defendant. Opening arguments begin on Monday in a high-profile trial brought by the state of New Mexico against Meta, which allegedly failed to safeguard apps like Facebook and Instagram from online predators who targeted child users, according to Raúl Torrez, the state's attorney general. Originally filed in 2023, the suit claims that Meta \"steered and connected users — including children — to sexually explicit, exploitative and child sex abuse materials and facilitated human trafficking\" within the state.  \"What we are really alleging is that Meta has created a dangerous product, a product that enables not only the targeting of children, but the exploitation of children in virtual spaces and in the real world,\" Torrez told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday.The trial is one of several significant cases involving Meta this year that could have major repercussions on the company and the broader social media industry. Experts have said the lawsuits resemble those brought against \"Big Tobacco\" in the 1990s, due to the alleged harm the products can have on users, and the efforts by tobacco companies to mislead the public about the negative effects.In January, a trial kicked off in Los Angeles stemming from plaintiffs' allegations that Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap failed to tell the public about the safety of their social and video-streaming apps, despite knowing that the designs and certain features were harmful to the mental health of young users. TikTok and Snap settled with a plaintiff involved in the case before the trial commenced.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta starts big week in court, with opening arguments beginning in New Mexico, LA trialsEpstein's Silicon Valley connections went beyond Gates and MuskOpenAI executives were on a tear trying to quell criticsNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says $660 billion capex buildout is sustainableOpening statements in the L.A. trial were supposed to begin last week, but were delayed following the unexpected illness of a lead attorney.  A Meta spokesperson said 18 jury members were impaneled Friday afternoon and that opening arguments begin on Monday. Instagram head Adam Mosseri is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, followed a week later by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Many of New Mexico's allegations against Meta were derived from an undercover operation conducted by the attorney general that involved the creation of a fake social media profile modeled after a 13-year-old girl. Torrez previously told CNBC that the dummy social media profile, \"was simply inundated with images and targeted solicitations, which, frankly, I found to be shocking.\"Meta has denied the allegations and said in various statements to the media that the company is \"focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"Torrez told CNBC on Monday that Meta could face significant financial penalties, but fundamentally, he wants the company to make changes.\"We need to have real age verification. We need to have changes to product design so that they don't connect kids with, with predators on the platform. We need full disclosures in terms of making their users aware of the ... potential harm and danger,\" he said.Although social media businesses have argued that content shared on their apps is protected under the Section 230 provision of the Communications Decency Act, the overall theme among the various lawsuits is that tech companies have allegedly endangered young users through the design and features of their apps.Later this year, another trial is slated to start in the Northern District of California. That federal case involves Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Snap, and centers on allegations that the companies built defective apps that resulted in teens and children developing unhealthy and addictive behaviors.WATCH: Magnificent 7 trade is broken and reversing.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive $100 refund on average, though State Farm says it will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in lower costs for customers.  That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.  Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a new car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid a billion dollars in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business.  Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC, it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesRetail investors rushed into Nvidia on Thursday following the chipmaker's latest earnings report, according to VandaTrack.Mom-and-pop traders recorded their highest levels of net buying in the stock during the first 80 minutes of a trading day going back to at least 2012, according to analyst Viraj Patel. Retail is not behind the selling that led to a lackluster reaction to the blockbuster results, Patel said.There's a caveat: Patel said there's strong selling in addition to buying in the chipmaker. That can help explain the stock's rocky action in morning trading, he added.\"Flows have been two-way,\" Patel wrote in a Thursday note. \"Total retail turnover in [Nvidia] has been pretty epic too at the start of the session.\"Thursday's action comes on the heels of the AI darling's earnings, which beat analyst expectations and came with strong guidance. Nvidia also reported 75% revenue growth in its core data center business, which helped drive the company's overall sales up 73%.Despite trading modestly higher before the bell, shares were lower by more than 4% in midday trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-day chartBroadcom, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) have seen \"spillover buying\" as retail investors up their activity more broadly, Patel said.\"If this continues, then we may be on track for one of the biggest days of retail buying of single stocks in months, which matters a lot for the overall risk view,\" Patel said.To be sure, everyday traders were relatively reserved heading into Nvidia's report. Average daily net flow over the five-day window ahead of the release was $94 million, around half of what was seen in the runup to the prior report, Vanda said Wednesday.Nvidia has been a top stock for retail investors since 2023, Vanda data shows. Despite Thursday's slide, Wall Street is bullish on the path ahead: The typical analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can jump more than 35% over the next 12 months.",

    "body": "Students are seen on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 14, 2025.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesColumbia University said a student was detained by federal agents early Thursday, the latest sign of President Donald Trump's nationwide escalation of immigration enforcement.The student was taken by Department of Homeland Security officials from a university-owned residential building around 6:30 a.m., according to an email from Claire Shipman, the school's acting president, obtained by CNBC. \"Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a 'missing person,'\" Shipman said.A DHS official said in statement to CNBC that Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Elmina Aghayeva. The official described Aghayeva as an Azerbaijan native whose student visa was terminated by the Obama administration in 2016.\"The building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment,\" the official said. \"She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS.\"The student was not named in Shipman's email. The New York City-based university is gathering more details and attempting to contact the student's family, Shipman said.Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal said in a social media post that ICE \"used a phony missing persons bulletin\" about a 5-year-old girl. He said federal agents \"purposefully deceived\" campus housing and security personnel to enter the student's apartment.Thursday's detainment comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan said earlier this month that the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, bringing the backlash against the White House's efforts to a fever pitch.All law enforcement agents required a judicial warrant or subpoena to enter housing and other non-public campus areas, Shipman said in her email. Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.Columbia has been in the White House's crosshairs since Trump returned to office last year.The Education Department said in June that the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration cut.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released after months in ICE detention last year.The White House referred CNBC to DHS when contacted for comment.",

Cuba's coast guard said on February 25, 2026, it shot dead four people and wounded six others traveling in a US-registered speedboat during an exchange of fire near Cuba's shores that came amid heightened tensions with Washington.Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Kremlin on Thursday said that the situation in fuel-starved Cuba is intensifying after a deadly incident with a U.S.-registered speedboat off the coast of the Caribbean island. \"We see that the situation around Cuba is escalating,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.\"The most important thing is the humanitarian component. Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said. The comments come shortly after Cuba's Interior Ministry said border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters. The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island. The individuals, all of whom were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's Interior Ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as \"highly unusual\" and said the White House would \"respond appropriately\" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

The Trump administration has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching a military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.U.S. President Donald Trump has since said Cuba's government poses \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.

Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats will force a vote on a war powers resolution relating to Iran next week, Democratic leadership announced Thursday, as President Donald Trump engages in a massive military buildup in the region. The resolution would limit Trump's ability to conduct military action there.Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., have introduced a measure known as a war powers resolution that would compel the administration to seek congressional approval before engaging in any further activity in Iran. Congress has the sole authority to declare war under the U.S. Constitution, though that authority has been stretched in recent years by the executive branch. \"As soon as Congress reconvenes next week, we will compel a vote of the full House of Representatives on the bipartisan Khanna-Massie War Powers resolution,\" the Democratic leaders led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"The Iranian regime is brutal and destabilizing, seen most recently in the killing of thousands of protestors,\" the statement read. \"However, undertaking a war of choice in the Middle East, without a full understanding of all the attendant risks to our servicemembers and to escalation, is reckless.\"The war powers resolution would also need to be approved by the Senate if it is passed by the House. But passage from the House is far from a guaranteed outcome as bipartisan lawmakers have recently lined up against the resolution. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., released a statement last week opposing the measure, citing concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\"We respect and defend Congress's constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital,\" the pair wrote. \"However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\"Trump has overseen a massive military buildup in the Middle East and has threatened strikes against Iran. His administration is also negotiating with Tehran over the country's nuclear program. The two countries held a third round of talks in Geneva on Thursday.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi in a post on X described the day's negotiations as having made \"significant progress.\" He said that technical discussions will continue next week in Vienna and that the principals would reconvene \"soon after consultation in the respective capitals.\"The president said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he prefers to resolve the Iran situation diplomatically but did not take military force off the table. \"I will never allow the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said.

    "body": "Antonio Filosa attends the presentation of the new Fiat 500 Hybrid at the Stellantis FIAT Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy, on November 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAuto giant Stellantis on Thursday reported its first-ever annual loss after booking substantial write-downs amid a major strategic shift.The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, posted a full-year 2025 net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion), compared with full-year profit of 5.5 billion euros a year ago.The net loss was impacted by 25.4 billion euros in write-downs, Stellantis said, as the firm sharply scales back its electric vehicle strategy.Despite the results, shares of the company were up Thursday after CEO Antonio Filosa discussed Stellantis' North American operations leading a turnaround for the company, including better-than-expected results for the region during the second half of the year.\"North America is a very strong growth in volume. ... It is very encouraging,\" Filosa told investors during its results. \"This growth will be the largest contributor in the world for Stellantis' profitability.\"Shares of the company in Milan and New York were up roughly 5% as of 10:40 a.m. ET.Filosa said expected continued growth in North America will be led by new products as well as the increased production of trucks with Hemi V8 engines. He also said the company's decision to cancel its plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will help with profitability.Stellantis' results come as carmakers across the globe look to walk back their EV plans. Car giants including GM, Ford and Honda, for example, have all announced billions of dollars in charges to write down EV investments in recent months. The trend underscores the shifting dynamics at play on the road to full electrification.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMilan-listed shares of Stellantis so far this year.\"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies,\" Filosa said in a statement. \"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth,\" he added.Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.Other earnings highlights:Adjusted operating loss of 842 million euros in 2025, compared with an adjusted operating income of 8.65 billion euros in 2024.Estimates net tariff expenses of 1.6 billion euros in 2026. Stellantis said it expects positive industrial free cash flow in 2027.Over the second half of 2025, Stellantis it delivered a \"solid\" performance, noting consolidated shipments came in at 2.8 million units, with North America posting the strongest contribution. Net revenue rose 10% to 79.25 billion euros through the latter half of 2025 when compared with the same period a year ago. These results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies, disciplined commercial strategies and the strength of the firm's global brand portfolio, Stellantis said.",

    "body": "Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrives to attend a European Council summit at the EU headquarters in Brussels on March 21, 2024.Sameer Al-doumy | Afp | Getty ImagesHungary has accused Ukraine of disrupting oil supplies it gets from Russia and has stationed troops at critical energy facilities across the country as Prime Minister Viktor Orban ramps up the rhetoric around energy and national security ahead of parliamentary elections in April.Orban on Wednesday accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline which supplies it, and neighboring Slovakia, with Russian oil. Ukraine shut the pipeline a month ago, saying a Russian strike had damaged it, but Hungary's leader accused Kyiv of deliberately keeping the pipeline closed for \"political\" rather than \"technical\" reasons.\"The Ukrainian government is exerting pressure on the Hungarian and Slovak governments through an oil blockade,\" Orban said in a video on X following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday. \"They will not stop there,\" he claimed, adding: \"They are preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system,\" without further details or evidence.Orban said he had \"ordered the strengthening of the protection for critical energy infrastructure. That means that ⁠soldiers ​and the necessary equipment to repel potential attacks will be deployed near key ​energy facilities.\"\"The police will also patrol with increased forces around designated power plants, distribution stations and control centers,\" he said. Drones were also banned in the north-east border region with Ukraine. Ukraine has not publicly responded to the accusations and CNBC has contacted the country's foreign ministry for a response. The ramping up of rhetoric around energy and national security, and an increase in anti-Ukraine sentiment, comes as Hungary's leadership fights to stay in power ahead of a parliamentary election in April. Orban's right-wing Fidesz party is trailing in most independent polls while former party insider and center-right challenger, Peter Magyar, is leading voter surveys ahead of the April 12 vote.Thorny relationsThe comments come amid thorny relations between the countries over energy, Russia-related sanctions, and the ongoing war. EU countries Hungary and Slovakia have continued to import Russian oil and gas despite the bloc attempting to curb — and wanting to outright ban — such imports, with both countries saying their economies and citizens rely on cheap Russian energy supplies.The relationship with Russia goes deeper than just energy, however, with the leaders of both countries, Hungary's Orban and Slovakian PM Robert Fico, both having good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while having frosty relations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Thursday morning, Orban posted an open letter to Zelenskyy on Facebook, accusing him of \"working for four years to force Hungary into the war between you and Russia.\"Russia's President Vladimir Putin meets with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 5, 2024. Valery Sharifulin | Afp | Getty ImagesHungary and Slovakia have frequently opposed EU sanctions on Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, and they again blocked an attempt by the EU to impose more punitive measures on Moscow this week that coincided with the four-year anniversary of the war.Both said their vetoes were due to the halt in Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline — a Soviet-era pipeline whose name translates as \"Friendship\" — that connects the two countries via Ukraine.The countries' closeness to Russia and reluctance over sanctions have strained relations with Brussels, as they accuse the EU of turning a blind eye to their energy needs. Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó went further on Wednesday, saying Europe had overlooked incidents in which he said Ukraine was behind the sabotage of Russian-Europe energy infrastructure, such as the blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia to Germany. Ukraine has denied involvement in damage to one of the pipelines, but investigators in Germany have said the saboteurs were Ukrainian.\"The same people are blocking transportation on the Friendship oil pipeline today are the same as those who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipeline. This is the situation, and we cannot allow this,\" Szijjártó stated in comments reported by national news agency MTI. He did not produce evidence for his accusations.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThere is a $3 trillion opportunity for Black and other minority entrepreneurs to become business owners as part of the \"Great Business Transfer,\" according to a new report from McKinsey.\"This is the largest ownership transition in modern US history,\" said Shelley Stewart, a co-author of the report, senior partner and Chair of the McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility. \"This is a huge opportunity but there is also a challenge, the issue is many viable businesses may not successfully transfer because the market to connect buyers, sellers and capital is not built at scale.\"Researchers forecast 6 million small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, will be available for acquisition by 2035. If Black, Latino and women entrepreneurs can increase ownership in these transitioning businesses, it has the potential to unlock $3 trillion in new household wealth, the report found.McKinsey said the contrast between the opportunity and the risk is especially stark for the Black community.Only 3% of U.S. business owners are Black compared to 13% of the population. If current trends hold, Black entrepreneurs are expected gain $87 billion of the transferring enterprise value. However, if they increase their participation in the Great Business Transfer, the number could jump to more than $369 billion. Conversely, without greater participation, disparities in wealth would only be increased according to the report.Stewart added, the ripple effect of the transfer goes far beyond underrepresented communities.\"The thing that is going to make this successful is having the broadest pool of entrepreneurs to buy these businesses, so that means you have to be inclusive,\" said Stewart. \"This is in the interest of all Americans. This has implications on employment, it has implications on local economic spend, it has implications on wealth creation.\"Funding and finding the businessAccording to McKinsey, the biggest challenges for potential acquirers in the Black and other minority communities will be financing, gaining access to deal flow and navigating the advisory process in an acquisition.\"We have more Black check writers at venture capital firms and buyout firms than ever before,\" said Jacob Walthour of Blueprint Capital Advisors. \"Also working inside other traditional financial institutions like banks, so the capital is there.\" But Walthour added it's imperative for members of the Black and minority communities to understand the dynamics of acquiring a business compared to starting a new business.\"You can get people to put capital behind a business that already exists, one of the hardest things to do is raise capital to build that business,\" said Walthour. \"The basic principles of capitalism should always be in place and this includes return on investment. That's how professional investors think about allocating capital.\"John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation Hope, also emphasized the need for Black entrepreneurs to look for opportunities in essential industries as opposed to personal interests.\"You don't have to fall in love with this business,\" said Bryant. \"Business is not personal. Once that shift happens and you connect the hustle we have, the untapped ambition … that's how you become a millionaire. This boring traditional approach we have never tried.\"The planning process The McKinsey report highlights five stages of a successful ownership transfer: aspiration and preparation, search and sourcing, deal structuring and financing, ownership and value creation and succession and exit.Sheena Gray, CEO of the African American Advisors Association, said the transfer highlights the need for Certified Financial Planners as potential acquirers will, in many cases, enter unfamiliar financial territory.\"The right planning infrastructure can be meaningful to expand minority business ownership,\" said Gray. \"Certified Financial Planners are better positioned to structure tax strategies that will help someone when they want to transition to ownership strategically. It's an important component that most business owners don't think about when they are in talks about acquiring a new opportunity.\" Gravy Wealth founder Brandon William Jones is working with the National Black MBA Association to help professionals become business owners, a transition he calls going from an \"earner\" to an \"owner.\"\"It's more urgent now than ever to be in control and capture the value you create,\" said Jones. \"The world is moving to a place where the workers, the knowledge workers specifically, are now becoming optional.\"AI impactMcKinsey's Stewart said the potential for disruption from AI only increases the upside for business acquisition.\"What's in the 6 million businesses? You've got retail, you've got restaurants, you've got construction, you've got healthcare. You've got small manufacturing. These will certainly be impacted by AI, but these are labor intensive businesses that will continue to need labor,\" said Stewart, \"AI will play a role in helping entrepreneurs get smart on different industries, AI is not likely to eliminate the need for these businesses.\"\"It will be a question of whether we can create the market mechanism that connects businesses with entrepreneurs and capital. I actually think we could see an acceleration over the next decade if we can pull the infrastructure together that actually sets people up to buy these businesses.\"Jones also said AI can also be a key tool for narrowing wealth and ownership gaps: \"If someone is AI forward, not only can they potentially acquire this business they can run the AI playbook to drive a lot more efficiency and value.\"",

    "body": "Women investors are stepping up their game, gaining confidence and taking some more risks. Yet they still lag their male counterparts when it comes to the amount of money they are putting to work in the market.But women are expected to see an influx of wealth as part of what is being coined the \"Great Wealth Transfer.\" Cerulli Associates anticipates $105 trillion in wealth will be passed down to heirs through 2048, with about $54 trillion of that inheritance going to spouses. Women, on average, live nearly 6 years longer than men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That makes them more likely to be the prime recipients of that wealth. \"We're about to see this massive change in terms of who is going to control wealth,\" said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at wealth management firm Hightower Advisors. See Stephanie Link live here: CNBC Pro Live — Wealth for Women - You're invited to join us for an exclusive, live, in-person event on May 28 at the NASDAQ MarketSite designed specifically for serious investors who demand more than surface-level market commentary. More details below.Women commanded $18 trillion of investable assets in the United States in 2023, representing 34% of the assets under management, according to McKinsey & Company. That figure is expected to nearly double to $34 trillion by 2030, or about 38% of total U.S. assets, the consulting firm found. We've seen an improvement in terms of those that are getting more sophisticated, but we have a long, long way to go.Stephanie LinkHightower AdvisorsWhile the transfer of wealth is one way to narrow the gender investing gap, women are still earning less than men in the workplace. Women employed full time in the United States are typically paid 81 cents to every dollar paid to men, according to the National Women's Law Center. That has led to a gap in retirement savings, said Veronica Willis, global investment strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Willis co-authored the firm's 2025 \"Women and Investing\" report.  \"We have seen some signs that the gap is starting to close, but there is still some work to do,\" she said. How women investWomen are more likely to describe their investing approach as conservative, according to Wells Fargo's research. Link said she sees that with her female clients, who aren't focused on the beating the S&P 500 and instead want to preserve the wealth they have. \"We've seen an improvement in terms of those that are getting more sophisticated, but we have a long, long way to go,\" Link added.In fact, women are leaning a little less conservative these days and are actually taking a bit more risk, Willis said. They are also gaining confidence in their ability to invest, she noted. Some 71% of women said they invested in the stock market in 2024, up from 60% the year prior, according to a survey by Wells Fargo. Gen Z and millennials led the way. In fact, the firm's analysis found that the performance of single female and female-led accounts  over a seven-year period were similar to that of single male and male-led accounts. However, the female-led accounts had the highest risk-adjusted returns, Willis said. \"Women tend to be less likely to check those accounts every day, which means that they're less likely to make as many trades,\" she explained. \"That willingness to stick to an investment plan … works in the favor of these women.\"Maximize returnsPrasit photo | Moment | Getty ImagesInvestors should assess their goals to understand how they should be investing, Willis said. Then they should ensure they have the right allocations in their portfolio so their investments grow over time, she noted.\"[Make] sure that you have a good mix of equities, as well as some assets that are going to diversify a little bit of that equity risk,\" she said. \"[Resist] that urge to fly to safety, be in cash or all fixed income types of assets when it comes to that retirement bucket.\"Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at NB Private Wealth, likes to break it down by age groups.Women should start investing early, with those in their 20s and 30s focusing on discipline to create strong financial habits, she said.By the time they reach their later 30s and 40s, they should have started to accumulate some wealth, she noted. \"They also, however, should consider incorporating broader financial advice — not just how to allocate their 401(k) and optimizing their savings, but understanding that the working capital generated from working is a meaningful input in their financial equation,\"  Saccocia said. That includes issues around workplace compensation and the best ways to diversify equity ownership, she noted.Later in life, women should be honest about what they want both during and after their lifetimes. \"Who will continue their legacy? How do they think about balancing lifestyle, philanthropy, and generational wealth transfer? These should be clearly articulated as part of the conversation with their advisors,\" Saccocia said. For Hightower's Link, education is key. Start reading, find an advisor who can help you meet your goals and talk with other women, whether it is over a Mahjong game or in an investing group, she said. watch nowFor those who want to start investing, the best advice she got was from her father just after she graduated college in 1992. \"You start very early to invest, and when you're younger, you can take more risk … you want to have more equity exposure versus fixed income exposure,\" she said. \"You want to start to dollar cost averaging.\"Dollar cost averaging allows investors to build positions over time and at varying prices. Investors can take a certain amount — even $10, $50, $100 — directly out of their bank account and put it onto an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P, she said.Those who have 401(k)s can have funds directly taken out of their paycheck. \"You'll never miss it, and over time, you'll be very thankful and very grateful that you did this, because you're not going to be able to time the market,\" Link said.An Exclusive Invitation: CNBC Pro Live — Wealth for Women: You're invited to join us for an exclusive, live, in-person event on May 28 at the NASDAQ MarketSite designed specifically for serious investors who demand more than surface-level market commentary.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questions Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled \"The Financial Stability Oversight Council's Annual Report to Congress,\" in Dirksen building on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling President Donald Trump's bluff after he claimed to be \"ending\" the affordability crisis during his State of the Union address, opening a new front in the battle that could determine November's midterm elections.\"Your claims are directly at odds with the day-to-day experiences of American households, who are struggling with rising costs of essentials, including food, housing, health care, child care, and electricity,\" Warren, D-Mass., wrote in a letter to Trump, which was shared exclusively with CNBC after being sent late Wednesday. \"Despite your claims, you have not 'solved' affordability or 'defeated' inflation. Instead, over the past year, prices have skyrocketed for American households,\" Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote.Warren's letter is the launching point for a frontal assault on Trump and congressional Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could be decided over affordability. Trump's approval rating on the economy has plummeted as voters express concern about the high cost of living, a contrast with an economy he said was \"roaring\" during his State of the Union address. Now, Democrats are hoping to seize the opportunity to leverage affordability and kick Republicans out of power in Congress. Warren made clear the letter is only her first foray into knocking the president on affordability, as Democrats race around the country selling their economic message before November. \"Over the coming weeks, I will be writing to Administration officials, companies, and industry representatives directly about your chaotic tariffs and failed economic policies — seeking answers for the American people who are being forced to pay more on everything from groceries to housing,\" Warren said.Warren late Wednesday also sent a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy saying the online retailer was tardy in publicly saying that Trump's tariffs had contributed to price increases on its platform since their enactment. She also asked Amazon to respond to a series of questions about its future plans on price hikes given Trump's pledge to find ways tariffs in place. Spokespersons for Amazon and the White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump has at times suggested he is getting serious about addressing affordability concerns. He's called for a cap on interest on credit cards, which he did not mention in his speech. He's also called for a ban on institutional investors from buying homes, which he did mention. Both are also priorities of Warren's and the progressive left.But in his State of the Union address, Trump laid blame solely on Democrats for affordability and argued his administration has solved the problem, as polls consistently show increased economic concern from voters. \"You caused that problem,\" the president said. \"They knew their statements were a dirty, rotten lie. Their policies created the high prices, our policies are rapidly ending them.\"US President Donald Trump gestures as he delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile overall inflation has cooled significantly from recent highs, the cost of many everyday goods remains high, especially compared with before the Covid-19 pandemic. Electricity prices have skyrocketed amid increased demand from data centers, grocery prices remain high and housing costs have stayed inflated. Trump's tariff agenda has also contributed to lingering high prices. Trump doubled down on issuing tariffs through other means during his address, after the Supreme Court knocked down the authority he had been using to implement them. The tariffs will \"remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,\" he said. To Warren, that only provided ammunition. \"Rather than providing relief to consumers, you are pursuing additional across-the-board tariffs through other mechanisms — opening the door to yet another wave of price hikes,\" she said in her letter. watch now",

CEO Jamie Iannone said Depop would also allow eBay to expand its presence in fashion, which has emerged as one of the company's fastest-growing categories. The company has leaned into its other so-called focus categories, which include collectibles, car parts and accessories, and refurbished goods.EBay said in its fourth-quarter earnings report last week that gross merchandise volume from focus categories grew more than 16% year over year.watch now",

    "body": "Nvidia shares dropped 5% on Thursday, as investor concerns around its leadership in the artificial intelligence boom dampened enthusiasm over its earnings beat.The company reported stellar quarterly results, but the numbers were not enough to assuage Wall Street amid an already fragile time for stocks. Companies across many industries, ranging from trucking to software, have been rattled this year on fears of AI disruption to their businesses. Elevated valuations and high capital expenditures have also set a high bar for these names.\"The debate has shifted away from near-term results and toward the sustainability of AI capex spending, amid concerns around its quantum, monetization and potential cashflow degradation,\" Richard Clode, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, told CNBC. Nvidia's decline on the day also pressured several other leading chipmakers. Broadcom shares dropped nearly 6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing dropped more than 3%. Concerns about Nvidia-OpenAI dealInvestors are pointing to Nvidia's stalling $100 billion deal deal with OpenAI as a pain point for the stock. Nvidia's 10-K regulatory filing published on Wednesday states that while the company is \"finalizing an investment and partnership agreement\" with the maker of ChatGPT, \"There is no assurance that we will enter into an investment and partnership agreement with OpenAI or that a transaction will be completed.\" Tom Graff, chief investment officer at Facet, told CNBC that he expects a \"bumpy ride\" ahead for the stock for at least the next couple of quarters.He said that the market expected a good quarter from Nvidia after customers like Microsoft and Amazon projected higher spend on data centers, but investors were seeking more insight from the chip giant.\"What we didn't get were details about the future guidance,\" Graff said. \"If players like OpenAI might be slowing spending, that would show up in actual revenue one to two quarters from now, so the lack of specificity about the revenue outlook is generating some concerns.\"To be sure, Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson said that Nvidia provided more detailed guidance for the year than it usually does. He told CNBC that he remains optimistic that the company will be making a large investment in OpenAI despite the \"confusing\" language in the regulatory filing.'Odds were stacked against them'Market participants are also anticipating a potential shift in Nvidia's AI dominance as the industry pivots away from training-heavy demand toward inference-driven workloads, which some think could beef up competition from alternative chipmakers.\"Where [Nvidia] did miss was easing investors' concerns about its narrowing moat in the evolving world of compute,\" Fundstrat economic strategist Hardika Singh wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. In an interview with CNBC, Singh explained that the report shows \"just how emotions, not logic, is driving the stock market right now.\" She noted that just because there may be other players in the field, it shouldn't mean Nvidia can't emerge a winner. Singh added that the architecture of Nvidia's Vera Rubin chip is specifically designed to be very strong for inference.Similarly, Adam Phillips of EP Wealth Advisors and Dan Hanbury, global strategic equity co-portfolio manager at Ninety One, said they believe the post-earnings Nvidia reaction speaks to investors' anxiety around the AI trade in recent months. \"The odds were stacked against them,\" Phillips, the firm's managing director of investments, told CNBC. \"The bar is just so high right now considering the growth of this firm and the extent to which it's run here over the last couple of years.\"\"It's becoming harder and harder to impress the Street and I think that many investors are kind of just wondering where things go from here,\" he said. \"Is all this investment going to pay off?\"Hanbury noted that hyperscalers' free cash flow levels is another point of scrutiny for investors, given that demand for Nvidia's core products is affected by hyperscaler spending on AI-related capex. Strong growth reinforces confidenceAnalysts across the Street remain bullish on Nvidia shares. Of the 66 analysts covering the name, 61 rate it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Their average price target implies roughly 37% potential upside ahead for the stock, which is little changed on the year. Janus Henderson's Clode is optimistic on Nvidia's upbeat fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance, which came out well above analysts' forecast. Nvidia's data center unit also fueled its revenue boom for the latest quarter, bringing in 91% of sales. Data center revenue came in at $62.3 billion for the quarter, ahead of expectations for $60.69 billion, according to StreetAccount.\"The guidance of $78bn in revenues was well ahead of even the most bullish buyside expectations and the fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth in contrast to concerns around a slowdown,\" said Clode.Read more CNBC tech newsFirst look at Nvidia's new AI system Vera Rubin is 10 times more efficient than its predecessorSamsung's S26 gives an advance look at what the Google-powered Apple Siri could doThrive Capital invested about $1 billion in OpenAI at a $285 billion valuation, source saysHead of Amazon's AGI lab is leaving the company",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026.Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares climbed Thursday after the customer service software maker reported healthy results, although its fiscal 2027 revenue view trailed Wall Street projections.The company posted results Wednesday after the market close for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on Jan. 31.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.81 adjusted vs. $3.04 expectedRevenue: $11.20 billion vs. $11.18 billion expectedSalesforce's revenue grew 12% year over year in its fourth quarter, according to a statement. It's the company's fastest growth rate in two years.The company has allocated $50 billion for new share buybacks, \"because these are some low prices,\" CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce shares had fallen about 28% so far in 2026, while the S&P 500 index had gained 1%.Net income of $1.94 billion, or $2.07 per share, increased from $1.71 billion, or $1.75 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excludes stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs.Current remaining performance obligation, a sum of contracted but unrecognized revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue over the next year, came in at $35.1 billion. The figure was higher than StreetAccount's $34.53 billion consensus.Guidance for the fiscal first quarter included $3.11 to $3.13 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.03  billion to $11.08 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $3.00 per share and $10.99 billion in revenue.For the 2027 fiscal year, Salesforce called for $13.11 to $13.19 in adjusted earnings per share on $45.8 billion to $46.2 billion in revenue, which implies 10% to 11% growth. The LSEG consensus had $13.12 per share on $46.06 billion in revenue.

On Monday, IBM stock dropped 13% in its worst daily performance since 2000 after Anthropic published a blog post saying its Claude Code AI tool for developers can assist with modernizing code written in the Cobol programming language.During the quarter, Salesforce released an AI-enabled Slackbot assistant in its Slack team communication app for paying clients. The company also completed its $8 billion Informatica acquisition and announced plans to buy marketing company Qualified. Informatica, a data management software company, contributed $399 million in revenue during the quarter.The company now sees $63 billion in fiscal 2030 revenue, up from a target of over $60 billion it presented in October. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $59.07 billion. The new number includes a contribution from Informatica.Five customers of ServiceNow moved to Salesforce's competing product for information technology service management during the quarter, Benioff said on the TBPN podcast on Wednesday.Salesforce has been working to expand adoption of its Agentforce AI technology for automating customer service and other corporate functions. The company said annualized Agentforce revenue exceeded $800 million in the quarter. Morgan Stanley analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on Salesforce stock, said in a Monday note to clients that conversations with partners \"continue to indicate we are in the early innings.\"Meanwhile, Salesforce is seeing a benefit from its stake in Anthropic, generating an $811 million gain on strategic investments in the quarter. That's up from $96 million in the year-ago quarter.\"I think we just put another $100 million into the new round,\" Benioff said. We're [at] about $330 million into Anthropic invested. It's almost about 1% of Anthropic. And believe me, I wish we had invested a lot more.\"Benioff said the company isn't doing all that it can with debt.\"We're just very under-leveraged on our balance sheet,\" he said.WATCH: Investors are paying less and less for software earnings these days, says Jim Cramerwatch now",

    "body": "This combination of pictures created on April 09, 2025 shows US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff after a meeting with Russian officials at Diriyah Palace, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on February 18, 2025 (L); and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi speaking to AFP during an interview at the Iranian consulate in Jeddah on March 7, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | Amer Hilabi | AFP | Getty ImagesA third round of talks between the U.S. and Iran kicked off in Geneva on Thursday, with Iran under immense pressure to agree a nuclear deal with the States and to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile development programs.The U.S. has amassed a large military force in the Middle East ahead of the discussions and President Donald Trump warned last week that \"bad things\" would happen if Iran does not agree to a new nuclear deal.On the eve of the latest talks in Switzerland, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran's reluctance to discuss its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles was also a significant stumbling block. \"The negotiations [on Thursday] will be largely focused on the nuclear program, and we hope progress can be made ...  But it's also important to remember that Iran refuses – refuses – to talk about ballistic missiles to us or to anyone, and that's a big problem,\" he told reporters Wednesday.Rubio said that beyond the nuclear program, Iran's conventional weapons were \"solely designed to attack America and attack Americans, if they so choose to do so.  These things have to be addressed.\"watch nowTrump alleged in his State of the Union address on Tuesday that Tehran was working on rockets that could \"soon\" reach the U.S. but did not present evidence for his assertion.When asked how close Iran was to achieving such weaponry that posed a direct threat to U.S. territory, Rubio said, \"clearly they are headed in the pathway to one day being able to develop weapons that could reach the continental U.S. ... And the ranges continue to grow every single year exponentially,\" he said, calling it an \"unsustainable threat.\"Read moreThe latest round of talks on Thursday is being led by U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi heads up Tehran's delegation. Oman is mediating the discussions and the residence of the Omani ambassador to the United Nations is reportedly the venue for the talks.Pressure is certainly mounting on Iran to agree to a deal in which it bows to the U.S.' demand that it stops efforts to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. But Iran has previously insisted its missile program was never been part of the agenda of talks with the U.S., and that this was \"non-negotiable.\"Big breakthrough?Iran has previously rejected the U.S.' demand that it halt the enrichment of uranium inside its territory, and says it's needed for energy production. Araghchi has insisted that Iran would \"under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon.\" Tehran has signaled instead that it's prepared to make compromises to appease the U.S., however.Araghchi said Wednesday that a \"fair, balanced and equitable deal\" was within reach while Esmail Baghaei, spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Iranian state TV that \"Iran has come here with a very reasonable amount of flexibility.\" He added that Iran was \"entitled to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, that's a right that is recognized.\"Iran foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, speaks during a press conference at the Lutfi Krdar Congress Center on the sideline of the 51st session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), in Istanbul on June 22, 2025.Ozan Kose | Afp | Getty ImagesAraghchi had told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" last Sunday that he was still working on a proposal that would consist of elements that accommodate both sides' \"concerns and interests.\" He said the proposal would be discussed in Geneva and both sides will work on a text to try and reach \"a fast deal.\"Tehran is desperate for sanctions relief as anti-government protests over the country's economy and authoritarian leadership continue to rattle the regime. Those protests continued on Thursday with students leading the latest demonstrations across Iranian universities.Analysts are skeptical that the next 24 hours will lead to a big breakthrough in the impasse between the two sides but said imminent U.S. military action — which could unleash turmoil in the wider Middle East and for oil markets — was not an immediate threat, for now. Paul Musgrave, associate professor of government at Georgetown University in Qatar, told CNBC that both sides would \"reaffirm their core interests\" over the next 24 hours.\"On the Iranian side, I have to say that is really straightforward, making sure that the regime is secure, making sure that they have the option legally of pursuing a nuclear weapon, and ensuring that their conventional ballistic missile programme remains intact,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Thursday. watch now\"On the American side, we have seen a variety of goals expressed, some of which are incompatible with others, from protecting protesters to trying to get rid of the Iranian missiles, to trying to ban Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon. If you're the Iranian government, you're probably looking at this and trying to think exactly what do the Americans want out of this?\" he added.\"I don't expect any major breakthrough in the next 24 hours, but in the next 24 hours, I also don't expect military strikes,\" he said.",

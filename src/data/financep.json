    "body": "OpenAI's EMEA startups head Laura Modiano spoke at the Sifted Summit on Wednesday, 8 October.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIn the latest comparison between American and European founders, OpenAI's startup boss admitted that the Americans are \"almost shameless\" when it comes to making demands and giving feedback to the AI giant.Laura Modiano, who heads up OpenAI's startups division in EMEA, drew a comparison between American and European founders based on her extensive work with founders across both regions and rolling out AI features.\"So feedback is extremely important. We're moving at lightning speed. It has to represent your voice and I see American founders being extremely good, almost shameless, and coming in and saying: 'We need this. You need to get better at that. You need to improve that. You need this new feature,'\" Modiano said during a fireside chat at the Sifted Summit on Wednesday. \"If founders don't tell us, we don't always know.\"She called on European founders to be much more vocal — or risk missing out on big opportunities.\"Please, please, please, if you're using OpenAI ... you should always tell us what you think about it, what is working, what isn't and how we can do better.\"She cited Lovable, valued at $1.8 billion, as an example of a European company good at giving feedback. The Swedish vibe coding startup has a GPT-5-based assistant called Lovable Assistant 5.\"When GPT-5 was launched, they [Lovable] were one of the companies that launched with us, and they were in the alpha, so early access to GPT-5, and they gave us a lot of feedback. Like, I was in their office for a week, and literally every hour, we were having reviews,\" she said.\"'How is something working? What do we need?' So GPT-5 launching actually had the taste of European developers included in the model that all of you are using today. So unless you're vocal about it, you're missing out on a great opportunity.\"Swedish AI-learning platform Sana was another startup praised by Modiano.\"I was in their office a few months ago and they said: 'We really need this capability on voice, the tone of voice, the speed, this is what we need.' I got that feedback then we see who else has had similar feedback, and then we prioritize that feature on the roadmap to make sure that we're servicing what the customer is asking for,\" she said.\"I give this advice often. I say every startup, especially every AI startup, should have a chief feedback officer, because we can only ship and include things in our roadmap, different features, different improvements, if we know what customers want,\" she added.European vs. U.S. startupsWith her comments, Modiano was fanning the flames of a debate that has seen European entrepreneurs criticized for lacking the same intensity and vigor as their American counterparts.Earlier this year, some venture capitalists suggested that startup founders in Europe needed to increase their work hours — including working seven days a week — to be more competitive globally.Harry Stebbings, founder of 20VC, previously told CNBC Make It that Europeans are not as good at marketing themselves when pitching their company to venture capitalists and are often held back by a culture of reservedness.By contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories to promote their businesses: \"I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions,\" he said.More recently, U.K. Business Secretary Peter Kyle fired shots at British university students, criticizing them for lacking ambition and not having the drive to start their own companies, as opposed to students at American universities.\"In Britain, if you went to a group of undergraduates, how big would that group have to be before you found someone that said their choice of going to university … was because they wanted to become a founder?\" Kyle said at an event hosted by AI chipmaker Nvidia in London. \"The entrepreneurialism simply isn't there – the drive, the vigour.\"",

    "body": "Last year, while researching for my book \"Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives,\" I visited five of the world's healthiest countries — Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Spain — to see how they keep older adults active, engaged, purposeful, and healthy.I picked these countries because they have some of the longest healthy life expectancies in the world (in some cases, a decade longer than the U.S.). And none of them the most ideal environments for aging: Singapore is hot, crowded, and has a notoriously competitive work environment, for instance. In Spain, obesity and smoking rates are significant. If these countries can succeed, so can we.At a community development center in Kanazawa, Japan, older adults teach, volunteer, run the restaurant, or just hang out with young people and those with Down syndrome. In Korea, lifelong learning is written into the Constitution. Singapore is building a whole \"health district.\" Italy taps into the wisdom and energy of seniors through volunteering.After seeing how these countries are rewriting the rules on aging, I'm doing five things to live a longer, happier life.1. I'll plan for the next 20 years, like I did the last 20In other countries, definitions of \"old age\" are fluid, tied to individual circumstances rather than arbitrary dates. At 62, I can easily have another 20 or more years of good health, and unlike many older adults, I am going to plan them with the same seriousness of purpose I did the last 20.   I spent the first big chunk of my career managing people who create content. It was only in my 50s that I realized I was much happier telling the stories myself. In the last decade, I've written three books, hosted my own podcast, launched two weekly newsletters, and started a video channel on Instagram called GrandPeople. While our society often pushes us to make big, intentional career and life plans in our 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, we don't typically expect as much from people over the age of 60. But as I look ahead, I'm excited to continue honing and developing my craft. Because there's no reason the next 20 years can't be as meaningful and purposeful as the last. 2. I won't retire anytime soon, but I will rethink how I workJapan has the highest percentage of older workers in the world, and many of them aren't working just for the money. They do it for purpose, connection, and health. Most work part-time, on flexible schedules, or in job shares.While in Japan, I met older adults working on candy assembly lines, managing books for a machine tool company, running parking lots, driving taxis, and guiding tours.The lesson they embodied stuck with me. As I think about my own future, I plan to continue working, but on my terms. I'll keep writing books and telling stories. But maybe I won't commit to putting out two newsletters a week forever. And that's okay. Instead of working full-steam or retiring completely, I can find a middle ground. The goal is to keep working in a way that fits the life I want to lead.3. I'll spend time with people of all agesAmericans don't tend to think of intergenerational connection as a public health strategy, but people in the countries I visited see how important this is. Studies all over the world have shown the benefits of intergenerational relationships, such as increased happiness, a better sense of well-being, and improved physical and mental health.Even in the U.S., which has been described as one of the most age-segregated societies in the world, there are opportunities for intergenerational collaboration: at work, in neighborhoods, in volunteer settings, in families. I'll proactively find places and activities that connect me with younger generations, and choose to foster my friendships with people of all ages. Down the line, I'd consider moving into a place like Mirabella at Arizona State University or Gorham House in Maine, which combines a nursing home with a preschool. 4. I'll prioritize socializing over scrollingTime spent with friends has dropped precipitously in the U.S., while time spent with technology has skyrocketed. It doesn't have to be that way. I saw for myself how Italians spend more time at meals and with family and less time online. This couldn't be more important. A decades-long Harvard study tells us that positive relationships are key to living a longer, happier, healthier life — more crucial even than career achievement, money, exercise, or a healthy diet.My baby steps include being more intentional about family meals without phones and trying to cut back on the obsessive scrolling of the news and Instagram that interferes with human conversation.  5. I'll never stop learningResearch has demonstrated that learning supports healthy aging. Many states provide free or low-cost education opportunities to older adults, and I plan to take advantage of them. As I think ahead to my next book project, I might enroll in a writing seminar at an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute designed to serve older learners. Each one is associated with a university — the closest to me is at American University — and offers a wide range of classes. Whatever class I take or learning I do, it will be in person. Because interacting face-to-face maximizes social connection and healthy longevity. Ken Stern is a nationally recognized expert on longevity and aging. He is the founder of the Longevity Project and hosts the popular \"Century Lives\" podcast from the Stanford Center on Longevity. His most recent book is Healthy to 100: How Strong Social Ties Lead to Long Lives.\" He is also the former CEO of NPR.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines flight arrives at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, U.S., September 18, 2025.  Quinn Glabicki | ReutersSpirit Airlines won approval for a $475 million lifeline and a $150 million payment from its biggest aircraft lessor in court on Friday, as the struggling budget airline races to stabilize itself after its second bankruptcy since November. U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved the $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing, a lifeline that bankrupt companies can use to continue operating, along with $150 million from AerCap and the rejection of 27 airplane leases. Spirit said on Friday that $200 million would be immediately available for the carrier.Spirit has been cutting dozens of routes, announced plans to slash its fleet, and last month said it would furlough about one third of its flight attendants to cut costs. The airline is in talks with its pilots' union and is seeking about $100 million in cuts from that group.\"We are pleased to have reached another significant milestone in our restructuring, which represents continued progress toward securing a successful future for Spirit,\" Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in a news release Friday.Spirit's problems piled up in recent years: An engine recall, a failed acquisition by JetBlue, a jump in labor and other costs, and a shift in consumer tastes for more upmarket offerings. Spirit has spent more than a year trying to offer travelers roomier seats and other fare packages beyond the cheap tickets and a la carte add-ons like seat selection and cabin baggage that it's been known for for years.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flights",

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is leading a demonstration against the re-inauguration of authoritarian President Maduro this Friday.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesThe White House on Friday complained that President Donald Trump was snubbed for the Nobel Peace Prize because the award's committee placed \"politics over peace.\"But the prize's actual recipient, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, said she was partly dedicating the award to Trump for supporting her efforts to promote democracy in her country.Machado said in an X post that her cause of achieving freedom and democracy depends on Trump and other key allies.\"I dedicate this prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!\" she wrote.Machado's shoutout came less than three hours after White House communications director Steven Cheung claimed that by snubbing Trump, \"The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\"Trump reportedly called Machado on Friday to congratulate her on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.Trump for years has said he deserves the prize, which has been awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee more than 100 times since 1901 to honor one person's work to promote peace.He has also been openly critical of former President Barack Obama receiving the prize in 2009.\"They gave it to Obama for doing absolutely nothing but destroying our country,\" Trump said Thursday.In recent months, Trump has frequently said that he ended seven wars — a claim that has been disputed by fact checkers.After Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a peace plan this week, Trump claimed, \"This would be number eight.\"A number of Trump's Republican allies have advocated for him to get the prize, though the nomination deadline for the 2025 award ended less than two weeks into his current presidential term.Asked about the campaign for Trump, Nobel Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said that his panel is used to receiving media attention and \"thousands and thousands of letters\" every year.\"This committee sits in a room filled with the portraits of all laureates and that room is filled with both courage and integrity,\" Frydnes said at a press conference.\"We base only our decision on the work and the will of Alfred Nobel.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continues",

This is where I draw the line,\" Loomer wrote.Trump himself in 2017 said, \"The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\" That comment came during a dispute between Qatar and other Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, who had blockaded Qatar over claims that it had backed extremist Muslim groups.Qatar has denied financing terrorists.After a backlash among some Trump supporters, such as Loomer, to Friday's announcement, Hegseth posted what he called an \"important clarification\" on X, saying, \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft.\"\"However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base,\" Hegseth wrote. \"We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots.The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement.The announcement is another sign of the deepening of the relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesIn September, after Israel executed an airstrike on senior leaders of the Hamas terror group in Doha, Trump signed an executive order \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar.\"Earlier this year, the U.S accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family. Trump has said he wants that jet, valued at $400 million, converted for use as Air Force One, the presidential aircraft.NBC News has reported that the jet is expected to be handed over to Trump's future presidential library after he leaves the White House in January 2029.A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet looked like a bribe to Trump.Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm, as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat."

Previously, the option was limited to those with an aggressive risk tolerance and at least $1.5 million in assets who wanted crypto in a taxable brokerage account.  The move marks the latest expansion of access to crypto at the world's largest wealth management firm after the U.S. government's stance toward the nascent asset class flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Last month, Morgan Stanley said it would soon enable trading of bitcoin, ether and solana at its E-Trade subsidiary.Over the past two decades, Morgan Stanley has become an industry juggernaut, amassing $8.2 trillion in client assets across its wealth and investment management operations. In recent years, the bank has repeatedly shown it is keen to defend its position amid the rise of platforms including Coinbase and Robinhood.As Morgan Stanley drops its eligibility requirements for crypto funds, it will rely on an automated monitoring process to make sure that clients aren't overly concentrated in the volatile asset class, said people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified speaking about internal policy.The bank's global investment committee recently issued a model that recommended a maximum initial allocation to crypto of up to 4%, depending on goals ranging from \"wealth conservation\" to \"opportunistic growth.\"The committee \"considers cryptocurrency as a speculative and increasingly popular asset class that many investors, but not all, will seek to explore,\" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer for wealth management at the firm, said in the Oct. 1 report.As of now, advisors are still limited to pitching bitcoin funds from BlackRock and Fidelity, but Morgan Stanley is watching the industry for possible additions to those offerings, including other types of crypto, according to the people familiar.Clients can ask to be placed into any listed crypto exchange-traded product, they added.watch now"

    "body": "China's and U.S.' flags are seen printed on paper in this illustration taken January 27, 2022. Dado Ruvic | ReutersChina on Sunday said \"we are not afraid of\" a trade war with the United States after President Donald Trump vowed to impose punishing new retaliatory tariffs on Chinese imports.A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce accused the U.S. of a \"textbook double standard\" with Trump's promise on Friday to tack on additional 100% tariffs on those imports after China imposed new export controls on rare earths minerals.That promise in a social media post by the president shook U.S. stock markets on Friday, erasing $2 trillion in equity values in a single day.Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,\" the ministry spokesperson said.\"China's position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,\" they added.The spokesperson said that the United States \"for a long time … has been overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control, taking discriminatory actions against China, and imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures on various products, including semiconductor equipment and chips.\"The U.S. Commerce Control list covers more than 3,000 items, more than three times the approximately 900 items on China's Export Control List of Dual-use Items, the spokesperson said.China called its export controls on rare earth exports a \"legitimate\" measure under international law, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion.The Commerce Ministry said the controls, issued Thursday, were part of Beijing's effort to strengthen its export control system and \"better safeguard world peace and regional stability\" amid what it described as a turbulent global security environment.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesThe measures, which now cover not only rare earth materials but also related intellectual property and technologies, were announced just weeks before a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\"These controls do not constitute export bans. Applications that meet the requirements will be approved,\" the Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.\"China has fully assessed the potential impact of these measures on the supply chain and is confident that the impact will be very limited.\"Beijing's new curbs also require foreign entities to obtain a license to export products containing more than 0.1% of domestically-sourced rare earths, or manufactured using China's extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology. Applications for items that could be used in weapons or other military purposes will be denied.U.S. Trade Representative Jamison Greer said Sunday that the U.S. was not notified of the new export controls in advance, \"and quickly, as soon as we found out from public sources, we reached out to the Chinese to have a phone call, and they deferred.\"Greer, speaking on Fox News' \"Sunday Briefing,\" called China's move \"a power grab.\"Shortly after Beijing tightened export controls on rare earths, the European Chamber of Commerce in China reported a backlog of export license applications awaiting approval, saying the new restrictions \"add further complexity to the global supply chains of rare earth elements.\"\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tIn response to Beijing's move, Trump on Friday announced new tariffs of 100% on imports from China \"over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying\" beginning Nov. 1.Trump also said that the U.S., on that same date, would also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"Stock markets plunged after Trump said on Truth Social that \"there is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'\" with its rare earths policy.China accounts for about 70% of the global supply of rare earths and has repeatedly used the critically needed minerals as a bargaining chip in trade discussions.Tensions whipsawHours after tightening export controls on rare earths, Beijing also announced that it would start charging U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports from Oct. 14, mirroring a new U.S. fee on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports, set to take effect the same day.The U.S. accounts for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding, compared to 53.3% for China, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.China's Commerce Ministry defended its reciprocal decision as \"necessary passive defensive actions.\" It added that the U.S. actions \"seriously undermined the atmosphere of the economic and trade talks between the two sides.\"Senior U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade negotiations in Geneva in May — the first since Trump launched a global trade war. A follow-up meeting in London in June led to a trade \"framework,\" while a third round of high-level talks took place a month later in Stockholm, where both sides signaled progress in negotiations.The most recent trade meetings in Madrid in September yielded a \"basic framework consensus\" on the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok, ahead of a deadline to either sell off its U.S. business or shut down the social media app in the country.On Sept. 19, Trump and Xi spoke on the phone but did not finalize a deal on TikTok. After the call, Trump announced that he and Xi agreed to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum during the last week of October in Gyeongju, South Korea.While China has been silent on future meetings, Trump had also said he would visit China early next year and that Xi would come to the U.S. at a later date.However, Trump on Friday threatened in a social media post to cancel his upcoming meeting with Xi after China's latest tightening of export curbs on rare earths.— CNBC's Dan Mangan, Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this story.",

Nathan Howard | ReutersThe Trump administration and AstraZeneca announced Friday they have reached an agreement for the U.K.-based pharmaceutical giant to cut drug prices in the U.S.The deal with AstraZeneca follows a similar pact with U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which was announced late last month.AstraZeneca will agree to sell drugs directly to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed countries, or what Trump calls \"most-favored nation\" pricing, on a coming government website called TrumpRx.gov. AstraZeneca's primary care medications will be available on the site starting early next year, and the company will offer new prescription medications at most-favored nation pricing, said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot also said the company will be exempt from pharmaceutical sector tariffs as part of the agreement. Pfizer agreed to similar terms with the Trump administration and received a three-year carveout from pharmaceutical tariffs on the condition that it continued to invest in U.S. manufacturing.AstraZeneca in July said it would invest $50 billion in the U.S. by 2030. The company announced further details about those plans Friday ahead of the reported pricing deal announcement.President Donald Trump, administration officials and Soriot announced the agreement during a White House event on Friday. MSNBC earlier reported on the deal.Trump has pushed drugmakers to cut prices and build out manufacturing in the U.S., as sky-high costs for medicines relative to other developed countries irk voters across the political spectrum. As his administration threatened pharmaceutical companies with tariffs as high as 250% in recent months, many drugmakers announced significant investments in the U.S.Trump has said he aims to strike pricing deals with other major drugmakers in the weeks ahead. Trump suggested drugmakers and other companies have invested as much as they did because of the threat of higher tariff costs. \"Most of them are here because of tariffs,\" he said. "

For both indexes, it was the worst day since April, when Trump said he would slap \"reciprocal\" duties on U.S. trading partners.After market close on Friday, Trump declared in a social media post that the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China and, on Nov. 1, it would apply export controls \"on any and all critical software.\"Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla all slipped about 2% in extended trading following the post.The president's latest threats are disrupting, at least briefly, what had been a sustained rally in tech, built on hundreds of billions of dollars in planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.Read more CNBC tech newsSingapore police probe Nvidia customer Megaspeed over alleged China export violationsTesla faces U.S. auto safety probe after reports FSD ran red lights, caused collisionsTop Hollywood agencies slam OpenAI's Sora as 'exploitation' and a risk to clientsGoogle launches Gemini subscriptions to help corporate workers build AI agentsIn late September, Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units for training AI models, became the first company to reach a market cap of $4.5 trillion.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that foreign entities must now obtain a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earths sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology.The new rules for rare earths exports are set to take effect Dec. 1.U.S. and Chinese officials have been working to arrange a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming months, which will likely take place in Beijing, experts said.Dilara Irem Sancar | Anadolu | Getty Images\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\"They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,\" Trump wrote.The president said he had not spoken to Xi about the issue \"because there was no reason to do so.\"\"This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,\" Trump wrote, referring to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.Trump claimed that the United States has been contacted by other countries that are \"extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere.\"\"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,\" he wrote.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this story."

Ken Cedeno | ReutersDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at a U.S. Air Force Base in Idaho.Hegeth said the facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base will allow pilots from Qatar's air force to train with American military personnel.The Defense secretary made the announcement at a Pentagon press conference with Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.Hegseth said the facility will \"host a contingent a Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"Qatar is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. The Al-Udeid Air Base, whose 10,000 or so service members make it the largest American military installation in the Middle East, is located in Qatar, near the capital of Doha.Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist who has influence with President Donald Trump, blasted the announcement.\"Never thought I'd see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,\" Loomer wrote on X.\"I don't think I'll be voting in 2026. I cannot in good conscience make any excuses for the harboring of jihadis. This is where I draw the line,\" Loomer wrote.Trump himself in 2017 said, \"The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\" That comment came during a dispute between Qatar and other Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, who had blockaded Qatar over claims that it had backed extremist Muslim groups.Qatar has denied financing terrorists.After a backlash among some Trump supporters, such as Loomer, to Friday's announcement, Hegseth posted what he called an \"important clarification\" on X, saying, \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft.\"\"However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base,\" Hegseth wrote. \"We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots.The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement.The announcement is another sign of the deepening of the relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesIn September, after Israel executed an airstrike on senior leaders of the Hamas terror group in Doha, Trump signed an executive order \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar.\"Earlier this year, the U.S accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family. Trump has said he wants that jet, valued at $400 million, converted for use as Air Force One, the presidential aircraft.NBC News has reported that the jet is expected to be handed over to Trump's future presidential library after he leaves the White House in January 2029.A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet looked like a bribe to Trump.Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm, as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat."

Ingrassia, nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel.Source: DHSPresident Donald Trump's nominee to head the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Paul Ingrassia, was accused of sexual harassment, Politico reported.Ingrassia, who is currently the White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security, was investigated in connection with an incident in late July in which he told a lower-ranking female colleague on a business trip that she would be sharing a hotel room with him, Politico reported Thursday. The outlet cited five unnamed administration officials.The woman later \"discovered that Ingrassia had arranged ahead of time to have her hotel room canceled so she would have to stay with him,\" three officials said, according to Politico.She \"initially protested\" the arrangement, but relented in order to avoid causing a scene around other colleagues, Politico reported officials saying. The two slept in separate beds in the room, according to Politico.In a letter to Politico, a lawyer for the 30-year-old Ingrassia denied the harassment allegations.The news outlet did not name the woman, but said that she was a Trump appointee, \"Mr. Ingrassia has never harassed any coworkers — female or otherwise, sexually or otherwise — in connection with any employment,\" the attorney, Edward Paltzik, wrote.Paltzik said that while the two did share a hotel room on the trip, Ingrassia did not cancel the woman's reservation and \"no party engaged in inappropriate behavior.\"In a separate letter to CNBC, Paltzik said Ingrassia \"did not engage in any wrongdoing in connection with the matters reported.\"The woman filed a human resources complaint against him but retracted it days later out of fear of retaliation, three officials told Politico. An HR investigation into Ingrassia cleared him, Paltzik and a DHS spokesperson told Politico.The woman told Politico in a statement that she \"never felt uncomfortable\" about Ingrassia's behavior and that she never made a complaint.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Politico's report.Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that oversees whistleblower complaints and investigates federal employees.The nomination came after Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Dellinger had reportedly opposed the layoffs of federal employees ordered by Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Dellinger challenged his dismissal in a lawsuit but later dropped the suit.In his role as White House liaison, Ingrassia has pushed for the hiring of candidates at the Department of Justice who show \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump, ABC News earlier reported.Ingrassia's chances of being confirmed to lead OSC appeared to falter in July, when Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would not back Trump's pick.Read Politico's full report here."

He also said he expects some clarity on President Donald Trump's plans to issue new tariffs on China. The market soured on Friday after Trump threated a \"massive increase of Tariffs\" on Chinese products entering to U.S. to counter the country's expansion of rare earth mineral export restrictions. Friday evening, Trump announced on social media that he would put an extra 100% tariff on imports.Earnings season kicks off on Tuesday, starting with quarterly results from Blackrock, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Cramer said all three have had solid runs this year, and they \"aren't exactly in the crosshairs of the trade war.\" He suggested Goldman Sachs might have \"the biggest upside surprise.\" JPMorgan and Citigroup will report that day, and Cramer said he's optimistic about the results from both banks.Tuesday also brings earnings from Johnson & Johnson and Domino's Pizza. Cramer said he expects the pharmaceutical giant to report the best quarter of the sector, but indicated the pizza maker could miss the estimates.Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Abbott Laboratories are set to report on Wednesday, and Cramer noted that Morgan Stanley has been surprisingly positive for the last several quarters. He also said Abbott Laboratories is usually reliable.Wednesday also brings analyst meetings from Salesforce and Dollar Tree. Cramer noted that both companies' stocks have been under pressure as of late — with Salesforce weighed down by worries about its artificial intelligence offerings and Dollar Tree burdened by new tariffs.Trucking giant J.B. Hunt and United Airlines are set to report Wednesday, and Cramer said these two could provide a solid read on the economy as investors largely lack economic data due to the government shutdown.On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor, CSX and Charles Schwab will report earnings. Cramer said he expects largely positive figures from Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures chips for industry leaders Nvidia and AMD. Cramer said CSX will likely explain its recent leadership shakeup, while Schwab can give insight to retail participation in the market.Friday brings quarterly reports from American Express and oil giant SLB.

Still, Sora has climbed to the No. 1 spot in Apple's App Store, and OpenAI said this week it hit 1 million downloads in less than five days after launch.Major Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association have objected to OpenAI's copyright policies, and top Hollywood agencies are calling it \"exploitation.\" That's led to changes in how the model handles prompts for certain sensitive categories of generated content. CNBC's Julia Boorstin got access to Sora 2 and tried prompts like \"show me a video of a fat orange cartoon cat eating lasagna\" and \"create a superhero that wears a black cape and is saving a woman from a burning building.\" Some of the prompts failed due to copyright infringement, while others worked.

In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" said Airlines for America, whose members include Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and others.Bad weather could also snarl travel over the long weekend. The National Weather Service on Friday issued a flood watch for New York, Long Island, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey from an expected storm.During a federal government shutdown, \"essential\" workers such as air traffic controllers and TSA agents worth without pay, while many other employees are placed on furlough.A more than monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Absences of air traffic controllers rose this week as the current shutdown stretched into its second week, Bryan Bedford, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, reiterated to staff on Friday.\"Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,\" he said in a note to employees, which was seen by CNBC.Tuesday will mark the first partial paycheck for air traffic controllers, and Oct. 28 would be the first suspended payday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, said on Friday.The union said it plans to start informational leafleting on Tuesday at New York's LaGuardia Airport about the effects of the shutdown on controllers. Similar events are scheduled at other airports in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia. \"Participating air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals plan to engage with travelers to explain how the government shutdown introduces unnecessary risk to the National Airspace System (NAS) and is detrimental to efficiency,\" the union said.Delta CEO Ed Bastian earlier this week told CNBC that the carrier has so far not seen \"any impacts at all\" to its operation because of the shutdown. However, he said that could change if it continued for another roughly 10 days.On Friday, close to 3,700 U.S. flights were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, below the average daily rate of about 4,100 for U.S. airlines so far this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flights"

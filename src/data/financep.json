    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident. Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted. \"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch,\" Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday. He stressed \"everything in moderation\" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter. Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.\"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children,\" Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a \"paramount responsibility\" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform. He said his goal is  \"to make it easy for all parents\" to manage their children's YouTube use \"in a way that is suitable to their household,\" especially as every parent has a different approach. Bill Gates, Mark Cuban Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform. \"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it,\" Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. \"I think too much of anything is not a good thing.\"Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens. \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier,\" Gates said years ago. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk appears on a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle on Friday pushed back against a report that said the company will complete data centers for OpenAI, one of its major customers, in 2028, rather than 2027.The delay is due to a shortage of labor and materials, according to the Friday report from Bloomberg, which cited unnamed people. Oracle shares closed down more than 4% on Friday. \"Site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI following execution of the agreement and were jointly agreed,\" an Oracle spokesperson said in an email to CNBC. \"There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track.\"The Oracle spokesperson did not specify a timeline for turning on cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. In September, OpenAI said it had a partnership with Oracle worth more than $300 billion over the next five years. \"We have a good relationship with OpenAI,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two newly appointed CEOs, said at an October analyst meeting.Doing business with OpenAI is relatively new to 48-year-old Oracle. Historically, Oracle grew through sales of its database software and business applications. Its cloud infrastructure business now contributes over one-fourth of revenue, although Oracle remains a smaller hyperscaler than Amazon, Microsoft and Google. OpenAI has also made commitments to other companies as it looks to meet expected capacity needs. In September, Nvidia said it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia equipment for the San Francisco artificial intelligence startup. The first phase of that project is expected in the second half of 2026.Nvidia and OpenAI said in a September statement that they \"look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.\"But no announcement has come yet.In a November filing, Nvidia said \"there is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity.\"OpenAI has historically relied on Nvidia graphics processing units to operate ChatGPT and other products, and now it's also looking at designing custom chips in a collaboration with Broadcom. On Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out a timeline for the OpenAI work, which was announced in October. Broadcom and OpenAI said they had signed a term sheet.\"It's more like 2027, 2028, 2029, 10 gigawatts, that was the OpenAI discussion,\" Tan said on Broadcom's earnings call. \"And that's, I call it, an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed with respect to a very respected and valued customer, OpenAI. But we do not expect much in 2026.\"OpenAI declined to comment.WATCH: Oracle says there have been 'no delays' in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people.

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing.

Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on, as he signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday issuing a single regulation framework for artificial intelligence, undermining the power of individual states. \"To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,\" the order says. \"But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.\"The Trump administration, with the aid of AI and crypto czar David Sacks, has been pursuing a path that would allow federal rules to preempt state regulations on AI, a move meant to keep big Democratic-led states like California and New York from exerting their control over the growing industry. Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The move marks a win for tech companies like OpenAI and Google and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz that have lobbied to limit regulations they view as overly burdensome. AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

    "body": "In Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Walt Disney Co. tallied its second billion-dollar film of 2025 with the help of a determined bunny and mischievous fox.\"Zootopia 2\" is set to top $1 billion at the global box office on Friday, according to company estimates, joining the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\" as the only Hollywood-made films to cross the benchmark this year. Heading into the weekend, the film had tallied $232.7 million domestically and $753.4 million from international markets.\"This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world — and that is a Zootopia dream come true,\" Jared Bush, chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, wrote in a statement Friday.The only other film to cross the billion-dollar threshold this year is China's \"Ne Zha 2,\" which has collected $2.2 billion since its release in January, according to data from Comscore.\"With the evolution of global market trends in recent years, reaching $1 billion has become a little more of a novelty again,\" Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNBC. He also noted the importance of the film's \"staggering success in China.\" Nearly $450 million of the global haul for \"Zootopia 2\" has come from the region so far — a massive figure considering China has decreased the number of American films it permits to play in its theaters and has threatened to restrict even more because of escalated tariffs.\"Zootopia 2\" had the highest animated opening of all time for a non-local title in China and broke the record for highest-grossing non-local animated film of all time within five days of its release in the country, Disney reported.The film's billion-dollar haul also highlights a transition in the domestic theatrical marketplace. PG-rated family films have outperformed PG-13 and R-rated films at the box office in 2025. So far, PG films released this year have generated $2.7 billion in the U.S. and Canada, while PG-13 films have tallied $2.5 billion and R-rated films have collected $2.4 billion.This shift started in 2024, when PG-rated films sold more tickets domestically than any other rated film for the first time ever. PG-13 films had dominated the space for decades, according to data from Comscore. \"With PG-rated films, it is often the kids who make the decision as to whether to hit the multiplex, and their influence can be seen directly in the numbers for the category that have hit all-time highs over the past couple of years,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"Equally impressive is that most PG movie tickets sold are at a child-friendly lower price point and therefore reaching these huge box-office milestones is made even more impressive.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersBroadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter. The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4.5% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 5%, respectively. AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.69%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1%. The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.\"This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,\" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"We would be buyers on this pullback.\"Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It closed on Friday just below $360. \"This is still where the growth is,\" Rakesh said. \"They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta, to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.\" Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.watch nowCEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher up-front costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks. Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, \"We do not expect much in '26.\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that \"AI angst\" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.\"Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,\" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note. Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt. CoreWeave, which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 10% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

    "body": "Lauripatterson | E+ | Getty ImagesConsumers are still dining out, but instead of higher-priced entrees, many are ordering more appetizers. As food inflation and affordability dominates the conversation about the U.S. consumer, new restaurant purchasing data shows even among Americans who are going to restaurants, many are in the mindset of cutting back.\"Appetizer orders are up 20% year over year, even as entrees and desserts are largely flat or declining,\" said Jim Pazzanese, executive vice president of global strategic procurement of Buyers Edge Platform, which tracks supply chain data within the food service industry. \"The shift is visible at the item level,\" he said, with some popular appetizer sales to restaurant operators experiencing growth rates north of 30%.Top-growing appetizersMozzarella sticks, up 36%Pickle chips, up 35%Cheese curds, up 33%Jalapeno poppers, up 20%Cheese bites, up 17%Source: Buyers Edge, year-to-date dataPazzanese is calling the current restaurant environment the \"appetizer economy.\"Meanwhile, he says dessert orders are down 2 percent year over year.One reason for the rising popularity of appetizers, Pazzanese says, is their link to promotions, which are key to getting Americans to spend in the current economic environment.\"Consumers realize appetizers are more frequently tied to promotions and drink specials,\" he said. \"This makes eating out more affordable.\"He added that buying of frozen or shelf-stable appetizers, which are the fastest-growing appetizer SKUs, makes sense from an economic perspective for restaurant operators, too. \"This is helping owners and managers reduce waste and manage unpredictable demands,\" Pazzanese said.\"The K-shaped economy we are seeing is being reflected in food spending,\" said Brian Choi, CEO of the Food Institute. In the grocery store, he said that is being seen in the continued migration to private label brands as food inflation influences consumer purchasing.\"The top 10 percent are increasing their spending in novel products and are willing to pay, but the vast majority of consumers are moving down to private label versus national brands,\" said Choi. \"Consumers can save anywhere from 10-20 percent by switching to a private label,\" Choi added.In a recent Food Institute survey, consumer perception of private labels has gone up substantially over the last five years, and it is now on par with national brands.\"Albertsons, Costco, and Kroger are just some examples of companies increasing their shelf space for their own,\" Choi said.\"Save Mart launched a private-label for beef, poultry, and pork, and Amazon launched Amazon Grocery with many products under $5,\" Choi said. \"Albertsons believes private label could represent 30 percent of sales.\"Amazon debuted its private-label grocer in October.While inflation may be down from 2022 highs, food inflation has been stubborn, according to Food Institute data. \"Food price inflation has increased since the midpoint of 2025, with food-at-home prices up in the range of 1.9 percent to 2.7 percent year-over-year,\" Choi said.The latest consumer price index for September — the October report was not produced due to the government shutdown and the November report delayed — showed food prices up 3.1% year over year. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year.\"We expect further growth for private label, and it should outpace national brands in 2026,\" Choi said.The September CPI showed \"food away from home\" inflation even higher than food inflation overall, at 3.7%, with full-service meals at 4.2%. That is leading to more private-label spending by restaurants, college and university dining halls, and convenience stores.\"The $1.5 trillion food away from home industry is seeing the move to more private label brands to save money,\" said Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the IFMA, the Food Away from Home Association.\"Tariffs and supply chain issues have led to price increases, especially in perishable items,\" Kafarakis said.Pricing relief is not expected to arrive soon.\"Consumers do not understand the food supply chain,\" Kafarakis said. \"It doesn't correct itself in weeks.\"IMFA expects that consumers will start to see some price relief from tariffs in the spring.\"Consumers do not know how long it takes to produce beef, and if you have a drought or other problems that impact the supply chain, it takes time to build the supply chain back up,\" Kafarakis said.",

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "body": "Workers are suspended on a Pepsi sign on a building outside of Allegiant Stadium ahead of LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., February 9, 2024.Brian Snyder | ReutersOne of this year's top food trends is facing some tough competition.Protein captivated consumers and food companies in 2025, but fiber is increasingly stealing the scene as people place an increasing emphasis on promoting gut health.It's taken hold on social media, where \"fibermaxxing\" — or the concept of increasing fiber intake through whole foods like fruits and legumes — has seen thousands of posts.\"Fiber is finally getting a spotlight, which is a great thing because it's a nutrient that people need,\" said Stephanie Mattucci, principal strategist at food research company Mintel.Currently, 90% of women and 97% of men in the U.S. are not meeting their daily fiber requirements, Mattucci said. For most Americans, that recommended range usually falls somewhere between 25 grams and 38 grams of fiber per day, she added.But more people are beginning to take notice of those gaps.According to Mattucci, 22% of consumers in the U.S. said high fiber content was one of their top three important factors when shopping for food — up from just 17% in 2021.Wall Street's companies are taking note, too. On an earnings call with analysts in October, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said fiber was emerging at the forefront of the company's product goals as it looked ahead to 2026.\"I think fiber will be the next protein,\" Laguarta said. \"Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated.\"In February, the company is going a step farther and plans to launch Smartfood Fiber Pop, featuring six grams of fiber per serving, and SunChips Fiber, incorporating fiber variants like whole grains and black beans, Pepsi's chief science officer, Tara Glasgow, told CNBC exclusively.Smartfood Fiber Pop and Sun Chips Fiber snacks.Source: PepsicoAnd there's a reason companies are broadening their offerings. Research firm Datassential found that fiber is on track to be the \"next big health trend following on the heels of protein\" in its 2026 trends report.Of the consumers the firm surveyed, 54% said they are interested in foods and beverages that are high in fiber. That number is even higher — reaching 60% — among members of Generation Z, who are pioneering the \"fibermaxxing\" trend on social media.And 42% of consumers said they believe the attribute of \"high fiber\" on a nutrition label of any food or beverage product is important to defining that product as \"healthy,\" according to Datassential.It's that momentum that landed fiber as one of Whole Foods Market's top trends for 2026.The gut health crazeWatching fiber intake isn't new, experts note, but it's often been associated with older people who require it for health reasons as they age.\"When I think of fiber, I immediately think of my grandfather. Every day, he had his little baggie of All-Bran, and he brought it everywhere he went, probably out of necessity,\" Mintel's Mattucci said, citing the slowing of digestive tracts as people age.Still, something has shifted as consumers of all ages have started placing more emphasis on promoting gut health and digestive wellness — and fiber entered the spotlight.The emphasis on diversity of fiber intake and finding it in everyday whole foods rather than through supplements or powders is part of what's allowing it to find popularity and align with current culture, according to Angela Salas, a senior dietitian at the University of California, Davis.watch nowThe two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — work together to keep people fuller for longer, improve digestion, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol, Salas said. In some ways, fiber could mimic the effects of weight-loss drugs because it takes longer to break down food and therefore sits in the stomach for longer, she said, which could be a factor for its recent popularity.\"These nutrients have always been around and always kind of shifts, I think, from the food industry saying, 'What can we highlight? What do people want to be focusing on so that we can continue to sell the same product, just slightly altered?'\" Salas said.Still, Kate Pelletier, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the University of Michigan Health, said it's important to note that fiber is not sufficient as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs, and a balanced plate is the best way to stay healthy.Pelletier said fiber's use as a \"street sweeper\" for the body is likely one of the reasons it's been thrust back into the spotlight.\"There's been a really big shift into more natural plants instead of popping a supplement or using a protein powder,\" Pelletier said. \"We can get the benefit of fiber from thinking about adding more wholesome foods into our diet, versus typical diet culture [which] focuses on taking out X, Y or Z.\" Promoting high-fiber productsFood and beverage companies are jumping on the momentum, too.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched its prebiotic soda, Simply Pop, with six grams of prebiotic fiber in five flavors to encourage gut health. Nestlé unveiled a new protein shake in June with four grams of prebiotic fiber designed specifically to support the digestive health of adults on GLP-1 medications.Other companies like Olipop have also entered the prebiotic soda market, boasting recipes that promote gut health, while smaller businesses, like Floura fiber bars and Sola Bagels, have also begun selling fiber-rich products.Olipop soda at a store in San Francisco, California, US, on Monday, March 17, 2025. Olipop Inc., the high-fiber, lower-sugar soda startup, raised $50 million in a Series C funding round at a valuation of $1.85 billion. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPepsi's Glasgow told CNBC the company is taking every opportunity to explore consumers' newfound interest in fiber. Glasgow said the research and development team's work starts in science and follows trends to keep up with their audience's evolving tastes.Pepsi already has products on the market that specifically boast high fiber content, like its prebiotic cola and Quaker oatmeal. As consumers start to explore the previously \"sleepy little nutrient,\" Glasgow said, Pepsi is innovating new products across its beverages and food brands.\"We hear it from consumers as well that they're becoming more knowledgeable about nutrition and their nutrition needs,\" Glasgow said. \"And I think that's where the excitement is coming from. I feel it growing.\"Glasgow said the company, which already launched successful protein-packed products this year, is moving toward products that incorporate multiple sources of gut-healthy ingredients.\"We saw protein grow in a big way in the last couple years,\" Glasgow said. \"I think [consumers] are then expanding their view, and they realize there's not one ingredient alone that is the silver bullet. It's about getting the right ingredients all together.\"For some, fiber isn't just a trend.Naomi Aganekwu, a 27-year-old content creator, said she started incorporating fiber more intentionally into her diet last year. Now, she makes sure each meal she eats has at least five to 10 grams of fiber through foods like beans, lentils and chia seed puddings.Aganekwu said she's seeing results from incorporating fiber into her diet, like being satiated after meals and seeing her hormonal acne reduce. And as she's championing fiber, she's seeing the people around her do the same, especially among her generation.It's become personal for Aganekwu, too, whose father died earlier this year of colon cancer. Some research has shown fiber could prevent colorectal cancer in addition to promoting overall health, according to the National Institutes of Health.\"You don't want to wait until you're 60 or 70 and you're dealing with more diagnoses,\" she said. \"There's a lot that you can do, even just in your everyday choices, down to what you're putting on your plate, that can directly impact your chances or decrease your chances of developing critical diseases.\"Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the level of fiber in Smartfood Fiber Pop.",

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate markets could get an influx of capital and investors under legislation approved by the House on ThursdayThe package of capital-formation bills, called the INVEST Act, passed the House 302 to 123. Eighty-seven Democrats joined every Republican in the House to support the bill. The wide-ranging package of legislation would allow more investors access to private markets. Lawmakers say the measure will help more companies go public and increase capital formation for startups.Instead of only wealth or income determining who can be an accredited investor, investors could become accredited by taking an exam approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said the bill was needed in part because of the decrease in the number of public companies in America. \"We make it easier to be a public company in America,\" Hill said on the House floor during debate on the bill. \"\"We make it easier, if you have a great idea, to crowdsource that idea, to raise money from friends and family. And we make it easier, if you're an individual investor, to have other opportunities in which to invest.\"The bill also would lift the cap for how much venture capital firms can raise, and how many people can invest, before they are subject to stricter disclosure and compliance regulations.The bill increases the number of investors to 500 from 250, and increases funds to $50 million from $10 million. It also would become easier for venture capital firms to invest in each other  — a change lawmakers say will help more funds reach companies in places like the Midwest and the South. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said that unicorn companies  — privately held startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more  — used to be rare. Now, he said there are \"herds of unicorns\" which limit investing opportunities for the public. \"We're trying to make sure that this is open and accessible to folks, and I think that's going to be a healthier approach for both the public markets and the private markets,\" Huizenga said. The bill now heads to the Senate, where making capital formation easier is on Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott's to-do list. It is not clear if the Senate will take up the House package, move individual pieces of it, or try to do its own bill. ",

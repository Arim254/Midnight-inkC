    "body": "Two HSBC bank logos are displayed on an office building in Mexico City, Mexico, July 25, 2025. Henry Romero | ReutersEurope's largest lender HSBC on Tuesday beat third-quarter profit expectations on the back of revenue growth, which included a rise in the bank's net interest income and a robust performance in its wealth segment.The bank's profit before tax for the three months ended in September was $7.3 billion, down nearly 14% from a year ago due to higher operating expenses, namely from notable items, including legal provisions of $1.4 billion.Here are HSBC's second-quarter 2025 results compared with consensus estimates compiled by the bank.Profit before tax: $7.3 billion vs. $5.98 billionRevenue: $17.8 billion vs. $17.05 billionThe earnings come a day after the bank said it will recognize a provision of $1.1 billion in its third-quarter results following a court ruling in Luxembourg related to the Bernard Madoff investment fraud case.The case stems from a 2009 lawsuit by Herald Fund SPC against HSBC's Luxembourg arm, seeking the return of securities and cash allegedly lost in the fraud.The court rejected the HSBC unit's appeal on the securities restitution claim, though it accepted its challenge about the cash portion.HSBC said it plans to file a further appeal with the Luxembourg Court of Appeal and, if that fails, it will dispute the final amount in later proceedings.The bank said the $1.1 billion provision will trim its Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital ratio by roughly 15 basis points. The CET1 ratio is a key indicator of a bank's financial strength.—CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.",

    "body": "To find out how well a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund has performed over a certain period, you typically look at total return.That number bakes in a few assumptions. Namely, that you put a chunk of money into the fund and let it sit there the entire time, periodically reinvesting any dividends that may have come in.Of course, that's not how real people invest. After you buy a fund, you might end up adding a few more shares if the fund gets hot. Or maybe you sell a chunk if you find another investment you like better.For this reason, even if you've held a fund for a decade, the 10-year return you see on your portfolio page is unlikely to match the official return on the fund's website. And, on average, investors' returns are lower than those of the funds they own.Over the 10 years ended December 2024, the average dollar invested in U.S. mutual funds and ETFs returned an annualized 7%, according to Morningstar's 2025 \"Mind the Gap\" study. Over the same period, those funds returned 8.2%, on average.Put another way, over the course of the decade researchers analyzed, investors lost out on about 15% of their returns.That 1.2 percentage-point difference is what Morningstar researchers call the \"investor return gap.\" In general, it can be attributed to investor behavior, says Jeffrey Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services.\"Literally, it would be buying high and selling low,\" Ptak says.How to narrow your performance gapThe most obvious examples of self-destructive behavior from investors come during market extremes, Ptak says, with over-exuberant investors piling into the market when stocks have already shot up and panic-selling when the market hits the skids.But the kind of behavior that leads to long-term underperformance \"could be much more mundane than that,\" he says. It just may be a coincidence of timing that you buy a fund before a few of its holdings decline in value. Or maybe you sell to raise money for something else, and the fund takes off.Morningstar's data isn't a perfect roadmap for maximizing returns from the funds you own, but it does potentially highlight a few possible strategies for keeping more of the money your funds earn. But remember: Experts recommend talking with a financial professional before making any major changes to your investing strategy.Avoid taking on too much riskAs a rule, investments that come with a higher level of risk also offer higher returns. Among professional investors, this is known as the risk \"premium.\"  But if you have a highly volatile fund in your portfolio, the data shows that you're less likely to realize that fund's full potential.\"More volatile funds are harder for investors to succeed with than less volatile funds,\" Ptak says. \"And that was true even when we were controlling for fund type.\"Across all types of mutual funds and ETFs, investors in the least volatile quintile of funds experienced a return gap of 0.4%, compared with a 2% gap among the most volatile funds.It's impossible to draw a precise conclusion as to why that is, but it's not hard to believe that financial psychology plays a role, Ptak says. Theoretically, the jumpier a fund's performance, the more tempted an investor might be to panic and sell when things get bad.\"Somebody could be following the theory and think, I'll invest in [riskier assets] that pay you a premium return,\" Ptak says. \"That's all well and good, but if you can't hang on, you aren't going to be getting any sort of risk premium. On the contrary, you'll probably have a gap.\"Invest deliberatelyMorningstar's data tends to support the idea that investors who take a hands-off, buy-and-hold approach generally have a smaller gap than people who trade more frequently.Case in point: Among the different types of funds researchers analyzed, allocation funds — which largely consist of target-date funds — produced the lowest investor gap on average, just 0.1 percentage point.The reason for the small gap likely comes down to how these funds, which are designed to grow more conservative as you age, are commonly held: in long-term retirement accounts.The best way to keep your investing gap narrow, Ptak says, is to invest in a diversified portfolio and automate your trading as much as you can to avoid discretionary or emotional trading.\"Less is more,\" he says. \"The less transacting you have to do, the better off you're going to be.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "President and CEO of Saudi's Aramco, Amin H. Nasser, speaks during the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia October 29, 2024. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersThink of Saudi Arabia and the first thing that comes to mind might be its massive, oil-derived wealth.While oil continues to drive Saudi Arabia's economy, the kingdom is now expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence, tourism and sports to diversify its growth avenues.According to Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih, more than half — 50.6% — of the Saudi economy is now \"completely decoupled\" from oil.\"This percentage is growing,\" Al Failh told CNBC's Dan Murphy, adding that government revenue used to be almost completely derived from oil money, but now, 40% of its revenue comes from sectors and sources that \"have nothing to do with oil.\"\"We're seeing great results, but we're not satisfied. We want to do more. We want to accelerate the kingdom's diversification and growth story,\" he said.Saudi Arabia is doubling down on fast-growing sectors such as artificial intelligence, naming it one of its new growth areas, with Al Failh saying the kingdom will be a \"key investor\" in developing AI applications and large language models. Saudi Arabia would also build data centers \"at a scale and at a competitive cost not achieved anywhere else.\"\"AI has emerged [in] the last three, four years, and it's definitely going to define how the future economy of every nation. Those who invest will lead, and those who lag behind, unfortunately, will lose,\" he pointed out.On Monday, AI chip company Groq's CEO, Jonathan Ross, told CNBC that  for AI infrastructure thanks to its energy surplus. The country could see more than $135 billion in gains by 2030 thanks to AI, according to PwC.Saudi Arabia's quarterly budget performance report revealed that total government revenue for the first half of 2025 came in at 565.21 billion Saudi riyals ($150.73 billion), with oil making up 53.4% of the country's overall revenue, down from 67.97% in the same period in 2019.In 2024, the country reported a 1.3% rise in full-year GDP, mainly driven by a 4.3% increase in non-oil segments. Oil activity, on the other hand, fell 4.5% year on year.The country's sovereign wealth fund — the Public Investment Fund — has acquired stakes in tech giants, video game publishers and football clubs as it uses oil revenues to diversify into other sectors.PIF has acquired stakes in video-game heavyweight Electronic Arts, establishing the SoftBank Vision Fund with Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp in 2017, and a takeover of English Premier League club Newcastle United in 2021.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhen asked if declining oil prices were piling pressure on Saudi Arabia's economy and government revenue, Al Falih said that the country was not scaling back budgets and there were no cuts to public spending.Oil prices have fallen in 2025, with Brent crude spot prices down 13.4% so far this year, according to FactSet. Saudi Arabia's oil revenue slid 24% in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe government will continue to address all activities that require government spending, Al Falih said, noting that the PIF has grown sixfold since its creation and that the country was approaching nearly $1 trillion in capital deployed across sectors of strategic interest.Tourism has also been a key growth area for Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Al-Khateeb, the country's tourism minister, told CNBC that the sector's share in GDP had grown to 5% in 2024 from 3% in 2019.\"We are [opening] resorts, new airlines, new airports, and the numbers are growing, and we are focusing on countries and visitors that are coming from outside to experience our great culture,\" Al-Khateeb highlighted.The tourism minister also expressed confidence that the sector could contribute 10% of GDP by 2030, aiming to raise it to 20% eventually.\"This 20% will help Saudi Arabia to diversify the economy and make it more sustainable,\" he added.",

    "body": "A container ship sails past buildings in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than a year, with its third-quarter gross domestic product growth topping analysts' estimates on Tuesday.According to advance estimates from Bank of Korea, GDP rose 1.7%, year on year, compared to the 1.5% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. The economy had grown by 0.6% in the second quarter.Data from the Bank of Korea revealed that growth was mostly supported by exports and the manufacturing sector that expanded 6% and 3.3%, respectively, year on year.The construction sector was the biggest drag on the economy, contracting 8.1% in the reported quarter compared to a year earlier.The growth in exports of goods and services, which came on the back of increased semiconductor and motor vehicle shipments, was the fastest since the third quarter of 2024.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the country's GDP expanded 1.2%, also beating Reuters poll estimates of a 0.9% growth.Experts that spoke to CNBC highlighted that although export figures were stronger on a year-on-year basis, compared to the second quarter, growth actually declined. HSBC's Korea economist Jin Choi told CNBC that the the annual rate was boosted by low base effects from last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, export growth slowed to 1.5% from 4.5% in the second quarter.\"For Korea's exports, we think there were relatively limited signs of frontloading, while global AI demand will likely continue to buttress Korea's semiconductor exports,\" Choi said.Homin Lee, senior macro strategist from Lombard Odier, said that the sequential fall was evidence that payback from tariff-related frontloading has already taken place to a degree.Lee said while there may be \"residual\" frontloading in non-tech exports facing tariff uncertainties, the main drivers for better growth in the third quarter were consumption and investment.These areas were boosted by the resolution of the post-martial law constitutional crisis, consumption voucher program, and broadening global AI capex boom, he added.HSBC's Choi said that going forward, continued private consumption recovery, a bottoming out of the construction sector, and expansionary fiscal policy, rather than exports, will be the main drivers for Korea's growth recovery.Trade talksSouth Korea's GDP data comes as the country's negotiators continue to wrangle over details of a trade deal with the Trump administration. In an interview with Bloomberg last Friday, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung said that the two country's were deadlocked on key details over Seoul's $350 billion investment pledge.\"The U.S. will of course try to maximize its interests, but it mustn't be to the extent that causes catastrophic consequences for South Korea,\" Lee said in the interview.In July, South Korea reached a trade deal with Trump that featured blanket tariffs on the country's exports to U.S. at 15% — down from the 25% Trump announced earlier. In return, Seoul had pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S.Lee is set to meet Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit being held in Gyeongju, South Korea, later this week.The Bank of Korea in its statement last Thursday said that the economy has continued to improve, supported by a sustained recovery in consumption and favorable exports growth.\"Going forward, domestic demand is expected to continue its recovery, led by consumption, and exports are likely to remain favourable for some time owing to the strong semiconductor sector, but the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports are likely to expand gradually,\" the BOK added.The central bank has forecast full-year growth for 2025 at 0.9%, and 1.6% for 2026",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

    "body": "Dan Rosensweig, CEO, CheggScott Mlyn | CNBCChegg said on Monday it would lay off about 45% of its workforce, or 388 employees, as the \"new realities\" of artificial intelligence and diminished traffic from internet search have led to plummeting revenue. The online education company, founded 20 years ago, has been hit by the rise of generative AI software tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which have become increasingly popular among students. Chegg also sued Google in February, arguing that AI summaries of search results have hurt its traffic and sales.The company reiterated that claim on Monday, saying AI and \"reduced traffic from Google to content publishers\" have damaged its business.\"As a result, and reflecting the company's continued investment in AI, Chegg is restructuring the way it operates its academic learning products,\" the company said.The cuts come after Chegg in May laid off 22% of its workforce, citing increasing adoption of AI.Chegg went public in 2013 and saw its stock price hit a high of $113.51 in February 2021, boosted by the Covid pandemic and a shift to remote learning. The stock has since lost 99% of its value. Its market cap peaked at about $14.7 billion, before falling to roughly $156 million.The company offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, as well as a newer suite of AI tools like a service that automatically generates flashcards.As part of Monday's announcement, the company said Dan Rosensweig will return as CEO effective immediately, replacing Nathan Schultz, who will step down from the role and remain as an executive advisor to Rosensweig and Chegg's board.Rosensweig, a former top executive at Yahoo who joined Chegg as CEO in 2010, stepped down from the post in April 2024, handing the job to Schultz, who was operating chief at the time.Chegg also said it plans to remain a standalone company, ending a strategic review process that began earlier this year.\"After thoughtful consideration of multiple proposals, the board unanimously determined that remaining an independent public company offers the best opportunity to maximize long-term shareholder value,\" the company said.In April, Chegg was at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Chegg received the warning when the stock was trading at about 60 cents. Trading below $1 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period triggers a warning. By May, the stock was back over $1.— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Chegg sues Google over AI-generated information blurbs in searcheswatch now",

    "body": "Klaudia Radecka | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAirbnb wants to block parties this spooky season.The travel and home rental platform said Monday that it will utilize its anti-party technology this Halloween weekend. The tech factors in the length of a stay, the distance from a guest's location, property type and timing of a booking to block reservations deemed \"higher risk.\"\"We lead the way in proactive measures to reduce the risk of unauthorized parties, and our heightened technology for Halloween is one important layer in a comprehensive suite of policies and tools to support hosts, guests and local communities, and promote responsible travel,\" the company wrote in a release.This isn't the first time Airbnb has attempted to block parties during holidays.Last year, the company said it prevented about 38,000 people in the U.S. and 6,300 in Canada from making bookings during Halloween weekend. The company has also used the tech during New Year's Eve and summer holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.Airbnb said the rate of parties reported worldwide has dropped by 50% since it implemented a ban on parties and events in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid. The party ban became official in 2022.The company cracked down on parties and implemented a number of new safety measures in 2019 in response to a deadly shooting at an Airbnb booking that left five dead.Following the shooting, CEO Brian Chesky announced a ban on \"party houses\" in a post to the social media platform now known as X. At the time, Chesky said that the company was also cracking down on \"abusive host and guest conduct.\"Airbnb said accounts that break the no party policy will be suspended or banned from the platform. The company also said its offers features like a 24-hour safety line and noise sensor for hosts.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new product updates, integrating AI and state of AI tech racewatch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a press conference following their meeting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

    "body": "Amazon Proteus robots demonstrate autonomous navigation using barcodes on the floor during the Delivering the Future event at the Amazon Robotics Innovation Hub in Westborough, Massachusetts, US, on Thursday, Nov. 10, 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence is widening the productivity gap between large and small companies, lifting up bigger firms that are able to effectively scale the technology and cut costs tied to human workers.Large-cap companies are seeing steady AI-related productivity gains since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT model in 2022 in terms of their real revenue per worker, according to a Wells Fargo analysis. Small-cap names are witnessing a decline over the same period, the firm found.\"While productivity for the S&P 500 has soared 5.5% since ChatGPT, it's down 12.3% for the Russell 2000,\" Wells Fargo equity strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote in recent note to clients. \"We see other examples of diverging trends in consumer, industrial, and financial markets.\"Wells Fargo analysis comparing real revenue per worker between Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indicesWells FargoBreakthrough advancements in AI this year have led major corporations such as Amazon to notably go all-in on the technology, finding ways to eliminate human roles that can be replaced by AI machines.The performance of the S&P 500 versus the Russell 2000 small-cap index reflect this divergence in productivity gains. The broad market index is up 74% since ChatGPT's 2022 launch, while the Russell is up only 39%.The biggest U.S. companies have been internally deploying AI tools over the past few years to improve their productivity and supply chains and, in some cases, cut head count. A World Economic Forum survey published at the start of 2025 found that roughly 40% of companies around the world expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years in roles where AI can automate tasks.Layoffs this year have been on the rise. Several big-name companies, including Target, Amazon, Meta, Starbucks, Oracle, Microsoft and UPS, have announced significant cuts to their total head count. For Target, the cuts are historic. Amazon is expected to announce historic cuts on Tuesday. Companies have mostly cited efforts to streamline operations and growth strategy as reasons for cuts, but many are nodding at AI as part of the reason that human worker roles can be axed now or in the future.For one, Amazon has been a leader in robot deployment across its facilities, which the e-commerce giant has said is improving costs and delivery times. The New York Times reported this month that Amazon executives believe the company is on track to replace more than half a million jobs with robots, which they think will save about 30 cents on each item Amazon selects, packs and delivers to customers. Morgan Stanley said Amazon's robotics efforts can save the company between $2 billion and $4 billion by 2027.Klarna, which has been among the most transparent in how AI is affecting its head count, said it has shrunk its workforce by about 40%, in part due to its AI investments. CrowdStrike in May announced cuts to 5% of the company's global workforce, citing AI efficiencies and saying that the technology \"flattens our hiring curve.\" IBM's CEO has forecast 30% of non-customer-facing roles will be cut by 2028 and told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year that AI chatbots have replaced 200 HR employees, freeing up investments to hire more people in sales and programming.Palo Alto Networks, Walmart and McDonald's are other companies that have notably been leveraging AI in ways that analysts expect will improve margins, CNBC previously reported.An Intuit QuickBooks Small Business Insights survey of 5,000 small businesses in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia in September revealed that 68% of businesses have integrated AI into their daily operations, with roughly two-thirds reporting an increase in productivity.\"The numbers don't lie,\" Wells Fargo's Kwon said in his report.",

    "body": "David Ryder | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAmazon is preparing to announce sweeping job cuts beginning Tuesday, CNBC has learned.The layoffs will amount to the largest cuts to Amazon's corporate workforce in the company's history, spanning almost every business, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.Amazon is expected to begin informing employees of the layoffs via email Tuesday morning, the person said.The company plans to lay off as many as 30,000 staffers across its corporate workforce, according to Reuters, which first reported the news.Amazon declined to comment.Amazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce. It has roughly 350,000 corporate employees.The planned layoffs would also represent the biggest job cuts across the tech industry since at least 2020, according to Layoffs.fyi. As of Monday, more than 200 tech companies have laid off approximately 98,000 employees since the start of the year, according to the site, which monitors job cuts in the tech sector.Microsoft has laid off about 15,000 people so far this year, while Meta last week eliminated roughly 600 jobs within its artificial intelligence unit. Google cut more than 100 design-related roles in its cloud unit earlier this month, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in September the company laid off 4,000 customer support staffers, pointing to its increasing AI adoption as a catalyst behind the cuts. Intel's cuts this year totaled 22,000 jobs, the most of any listed by Layoffs.fyi.The steepest year for job cuts in tech came in 2023, as the industry reckoned with soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Close to 1,200 tech companies slashed over 260,000 jobs, the site said.Over the past year, companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have also pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing size of their workforces.Amazon has conducted rolling layoffs across the company since 2022, which has resulted in more than 27,000 employees being let go. Job reductions have continued this year, though at a smaller scale. Amazon's cloud, stores, communications and devices divisions have been hit with layoffs in recent months.The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting campaign by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. Jassy has also moved to simplify Amazon's corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations.\"Jassy said in June that Amazon's workforce could shrink further as a result of the company embracing generative AI, telling staffers that the company \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"\"It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,\" Jassy said in the June memo to staff.WATCH: Report: Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts beginning Tuesdaywatch now",

    "body": "In an aerial view, a container ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland on October 10, 2025 in Oakland, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShares of several U.S.-listed rare earth miners fell sharply on Monday as U.S. officials said they expect China to delay introducing export controls on critical minerals as part of a broader trade deal.Critical Metals fell more than 17% in early deals, USA Rare Earth declined 12%, MP Materials was down 7.3% and Trilogy Metals lost 15%. Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, traded 14.7% and 9.5% lower, respectively.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News' \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that Washington and Beijing were expected to reach a deal to avoid a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with Beijing set to defer on imposing strict rare earth export controls.His comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday.Trump on Monday said that the U.S. and China were set to \"come away with\" a trade deal. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan amid a weeklong Asia trip, Trump said that he had \"a lot of respect for President Xi.\"watch nowThe U.S. president had previously threatened to impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting from Nov. 1, adding at the time that the White House would also slap export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"China, for its part, announced a new framework earlier this month for restricting rare earth exports. The move was seen as a stark warning to the West — and a reflection of the deepening mistrust between Beijing and Washington.To be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.\"Details are still limited, and nothing will be finalized until the Trump-Xi meeting,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 26 note.\"But a renewed truce now seems near-certain, with China likely fully delaying their rare earth export controls for a year—better than the alternative of an agreement to grant licenses,\" Marcus said.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Artificial intelligence startup Mercor announced on Monday a new Series C round that values the company at $10 billion, a fivefold increase since its last raise in February.The company said in a blog post that it raised $350 million in a round led by Felicis, which also led its $100 million Series B round, with participation from Benchmark, General Catalyst, and new investor Robinhood Ventures.The new investment will feed into three focus areas: Expanding the company's talent network, advancing its matching systems between experts and training opportunities, and providing faster delivery.Founded by three Thiel Fellows, the company initially started as a hiring company that assessed candidates by analyzing interview transcripts, resumes and personal portfolio websites to make recruiting decisions.After inadvertently amassing a network of specialized experts, the startup has pivoted to hiring highly skilled professionals to train AI models.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawMercor now manages over 30,000 contractors, who are collectively paid over $1.5 million each day and teach agents to think more like humans by \"sharing knowledge, experience, and context that can't be captured in code alone,\" the startup wrote in a blog post.The company was able to take advantage of the pivot to data-labeling after Meta paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI in June. As part of the deal, founder and then CEO Alexandr Wang stepped down to join the social media company.Concerns over Scale AI's neutrality following the Meta investment reportedly caused some large AI labs, including Google and OpenAI, to cut ties following the deal.\"It just doesn't happen too often in startups where your biggest competitor gets torpedoed overnight,\" cofounder Adarsh Hiremath told Forbes.The startup still faces competition in the data-labeling space, including Scale AI rival Surge AI, which is reportedly aiming for up to $1 billion in a new raise, according to Reuters. Turing AI reached a valuation of $2.2 billion in March, and Invisible Technologies raised $100 million in a new round to reach a value of over $2 billion in September.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowShareholders must vote to pay Tesla CEO Elon Musk almost $1 trillion, or he might not stay, Board Chair Robyn Denholm warned in a letter Monday.\"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,\" Denholm wrote ahead of Tesla's annual meeting on Nov. 6.Online shareholder votes regarding Musk's new pay plan and other proposals must be received by Tesla by or before 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5.Musk is key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being \"just another car company,\" with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus, Denholm argued.In May this year, as Musk faced criticism for neglecting Tesla while working for President Donald Trump, the billionaire CEO said he was committed to running his auto business for the next five years.Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest proxy advisory firm in the world, recommending against its \"astronomical\" value.Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk's embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand.Musk lashed out at top proxy advisors ISS and Glass Lewis, calling them \"corporate terrorists\" on an earnings call with analysts last week.ISS said it stands by its report. A spokesperson for Glass Lewis told CNBC, via e-mail, \"Our job as a proxy advisor is to provide informed analysis and recommendations to our clients worldwide. Those that are Tesla shareholders will ultimately make their own decisions about Mr. Musk's pay proposal and the Board directors that put it forward for shareholder vote.\"Denholm told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday that the company is at an \"important inflection point\" with artificial intelligence at the forefront.\"The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,\" she said.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawTesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines.The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones.The first tranche milestone is a market capitalization of $2 trillion. The company is currently worth about $1.5 trillion.The next nine tranches are awarded as the market cap increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. The last two tranches bump the increment to $1 trillion, putting a $8.5 trillion market capitalization as the last tranche.Product goals tied to the pay package:20 Million Tesla Vehicles Delivered​10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions​1 Million Bots Delivered​1 Million Robotaxis in Commercial OperationThere are also a series of adjusted EBITDA milestones, beginning at $50 billion and moving up to $400 billion.As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the Tesla board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of attainable goals.The proposed pay package would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla's earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots.\"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\" Musk said to analysts. \"I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.\"The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%.\"He's been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can't happen with the AI,\" Denholm told CNBC. \"So it's less about compensation and more about the voting influence.\"Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla's shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote.She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTesla year-to-date stock chart.5 quotes from Denholm's \"Squawk Box\" interview:On Musk's pay package and shareholder value:\"What we have done in the plan is we've bifurcated the voting rights versus the economic value. He doesn't get those economic value till at least year seven and a half, even if he delivers them in the first five years. And so that's one of the features of this plan. ... Firstly, shareholders get their return much earlier than Elon would if he delivers against the plan. And secondly, it really does make sure that the economic value is an incentive for him to stay at the company and continue to deliver for quite some time in the future.\"On the upcoming Roadster:\"It's on the roadmap.\"On autonomous driving and AI in vehicles:\"Leaning into FSD and actually AI in the vehicles has actually been the focus over this last period of time. The integration of that with a really purpose built vehicle for autonomy is actually really important, which is why you see the cyber cabs and, again, the vehicles that we have on the road today. Great vehicles using full self driving as well.\"On vote for Tesla to take a minority stake in xAI:\"It is a shareholder proposal, and what that means is that the company didn't put the proposal on the proxy. It was actually submitted by shareholders. We received a number of them, and actually this was the most common proposal around xAI to take a minority stake, or at least vote on that.\"On Optimus robots:\"So I've been in the lab with Optimus. He can fold laundry. He can wipe the table down really well, where he can hand things to you, you can actually shake hands with him. The tactile nature of his hand is actually really very good. ... He's very mobile and very dexterous. He's walking around the offices in Palo Alto all the time.\"watch nowCNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this story.",

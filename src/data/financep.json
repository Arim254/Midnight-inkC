    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump holds a bilateral meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.\"Trump said that as a result of that negotiation, he would no longer impose punitive tariffs on a slew of European countries that were set to begin Feb. 1.In an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen minutes after posting the statement, Trump described the Greenland framework as the \"concept of a deal.\"Read Trump's entire announcement, which he posted on Truth Social:Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations — They will report directly to me. Thank you for your attention to this matter!Stocks shot up immediately after Trump posted the update.Details about the framework agreement were unclear. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information.Despite its lack of detail, the announcement marks a stunning twist in the ongoing controversy over Trump's persistent efforts to acquire Greenland for the U.S.The Trump administration in recent weeks has floated buying the island or even utilizing the U.S. military to take control of it, even though it is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally.Danish and Greenlandic officials have rebuffed the U.S., reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. As tensions ratcheted up, a slew of European NATO nations increased their military presences in the territory. Over the weekend, Trump responded by threatening to hit those countries with new tariffs starting at 10% next month and increasing to 25% in June.Earlier Wednesday, during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump laid out his case for the U.S. to obtain Greenland on national-security grounds.But Trump said he would not use military force in pursuit of the territory. Stocks, which had plummeted a day earlier amid Trump's increasing aggression toward Greenland, immediately rebounded.This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "A person takes a break from clearing a walkway along Bannock Street as a winter storm sweeps over the intermountain West, plunging temperatures into the single digits and bringing along a light snow in its wake Saturday, Jan. 18, 2025, in Denver.David Zalubowski | APNatural gas prices soared more than 20% on Wednesday as an Arctic cold front is forecast to blast across the Upper Midwest and descend south to grip much of the U.S. with frigid temperatures through the weekend. Prices were about 25%, or 97 cents, to nearly $4.88 per million British thermal units. Heating demand is expected to spike as wind chills could fall to -50 degrees Fahrenheit across the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains, according to the National Weather Service. The wind chills pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin, the NWS warned. Power outages could prolong the risk, the federal agency said. Families should protect all pets from the cold, it said.Heavy snow is forecast for the southern high plains of Colorado and New Mexico on Friday, said Owen Shieh, a meteorologist at the NWS Weather Prediction Center in a public service announcement on social media. The storm will spread across the southern plains to the Mississippi Valley on Saturday before moving into southern Appalachia, the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday night into Sunday, Shieh said. A major ice storm threatens to hit Texas on Friday night and extend through the Deep South and the Carolinas into the weekend, the meteorologist said. This could lead to hazardous travel, downed trees and power lines, he said. Frigid subzero and single-digit temperatures will also expand into the Ohio Valley and Northeast by Sunday, according to the NWS. \"Due to the large extent and long duration of the extreme cold accompanying this winter storm, it will take longer for the snow and ice to melt after the storm,\" Shieh said. \"You need to prepare for the possibility of extended impacts, potentially for several days.\"",

    "body": "A drone view shows Netflix logos on buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026. Daniel Cole | ReutersNetflix jumped into the advertising business later than its media peers, but its strategy shift is starting to pay off.This week Netflix reported its fourth-quarter earnings, which were mostly overshadowed by the company's recent pursuit to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets. However, beyond the headlines, metrics like customer engagement, subscriber numbers and advertising revenue paint a promising picture. The earnings report provided some long-awaited clarity on the progress of Netflix's advertising strategy, and how it has been factoring into the overall business. On Tuesday Netflix said 2025 advertising revenue exceeded $1.5 billion — about 3% of total full-year revenue for the streaming giant — and is expected to double this year. Overall company revenue jumped almost 16% percent for 2025, while net income rose 26%. \"We're making good progress and the opportunity ahead of us is massive,\" Co-CEO Greg Peters said on Tuesday's call with investors. Wall Street analysts, however, noted that ad revenue disclosure fell short of their previous forecasts, indicating that it could be taking longer than expected to get the ad business off the ground. \"The last couple of years were slower out of the gate than we had estimated. However, advertising revenue growth is hitting its stride and should yield a similar contribution to revenue growth as we had estimated in our pre-4Q forecast,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a research note Wednesday. Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson noted total ad revenue was lower than the research firm had forecast but welcomed the fresh insights into the company's ad business. \"At least now we can finally have a better understanding of the contribution from advertising to total growth and can back into core subscription revenues,\" Fishman said in a note on Wednesday. Netflix's stock was trading down about 4% on Wednesday.Advertising has come front and center for media companies after it became clear that a subscription-only streaming model wouldn't be enough to support profitability. Advertisers, despite various headwinds, have been eager to find a place on streaming platforms, especially Netflix. Yet the industry leader was late to the advertising game after leadership long rejected the business model. It launched its cheaper, ad-supported tier in late 2022, coinciding with a brief slowdown in subscriber additions. Advertising and a crackdown on password sharing were put forth as measures to drive growth. And it has, even if slowly. Netflix said Tuesday it had 325 million global subscribers at the end of 2025. That marks an increase of roughly 23 million from the end of 2024, when Netflix last disclosed its global paid memberships. For comparison, Netflix added roughly 41 million subscribers in 2024 and almost 30 million in 2023. Against a backdrop of consistent price increases for streaming services, companies are increasingly leaning on the belief that consumers will opt for cheaper, ad-supported plans rather than drop out altogether. Peters said Tuesday that while there remains a gap between average revenue per membership of the company's standard, no-ads plan subscription and its ad-supported plan, \"that gap is narrowing.\" \"And while, because there's a gap, it means we're under-realizing revenue growth in the near time, it also, therefore, represents an opportunity for us,\" Peters said, pointing to upgrading the tech stack and ad capabilities to help drive growth.

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold prices climbed to a fresh record above $4,800 on Wednesday, extending a sharp rally as investors sought safety amid tariff threats from the White House and renewed concerns about a global trade war.The surge has reignited debate among investors over how much prices can rise after a blockbuster year for the bullion.Following a record-breaking 2025, gold has entered 2026 with momentum intact as geopolitical tensions, falling real interest rates and efforts by investors and central banks to diversify away from the dollar reinforce its role as the world's ultimate haven, analysts said.Forecasts are increasingly bullish. Analysts surveyed by the London Bullion Market Association expect prices to rise above $5,000 this year, citing expectations of lower U.S. real rates, continued Federal Reserve easing and sustained central-bank diversification away from the dollar.Julia Du, a senior commodities strategist at ICBC Standard Bank, sees gold prices pushing as high as $7,150.\"Gold remains the headline story after a record-breaking 2025,\" the LBMA said in its forecast survey.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGoldman Sachs also reiterated its bullish stance, calling gold its highest-conviction trade, driven by a shift in who is buying the metal.\"Gold remains our highest conviction long or base case, the price by the end of this year is $4,900,\" said Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs.He noted that central bank purchases drove gains in 2023 and 2024, while the rally accelerated in 2025 as private-sector demand increased.\"Private investors are starting to diversify into gold through different channels,\" he said in a media briefing on Wednesday, with ETF inflows offering one clear evidence of that shift, though it's difficult to separate retail demand from institutional flows. According to Goldman Sachs, demand largely came from private wealth firms, asset managers, hedge funds and pension investors.For many gold bulls, geopolitics remains the defining backdrop. Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP,  said the current cycle does not resemble a speculative peak. She expects gold prices to reach $5,400 this year.\"Last year was historic, sort of a once in a hundred year event across precious metals, where silver basically doubled,\" she said.\"Gold was up 60%, so we won't see a repeat of those gains, but $5,400 is a solid 30% up year on year,\" she said. \"This is a secular trade. This isn't a commodity blowoff top.\"Geopolitical tensions, she argued, are not fading into the background. Recent flashpoints, including U.S. actions in Venezuela and Washington's push to assert control over Greenland, have only deepened investors' flight to gold.\"You're entering a world where ... there is a strong demand to secure critical metals, critical commodities in this decade,\" Shiels said.",

Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStagnant mortgage rates, falling housing supply and ongoing economic uncertainty weighed heavily on homebuyers in December. Pending home sales, a measure of signed contracts on existing homes, dropped 9.3% last month from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts were expecting a slight gain. Sales were 3% lower than December 2024.\"The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\"Sales fell month to month in all regions of U.S. and were higher annually only in the South. Homes also stayed on the market longer in December, at an average of 39 days compared with 35 days in December 2024.Mortgage rates in December, when these deals were inked, barely moved at all. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan sat around 6.25%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is slightly lower than it was over the summer, but consumers were also facing a market with fewer homes available for sale.

Inventory was up 12% from a year ago, but that is off an extremely low level. \"Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Nov. 6, 2025.Chandan Khanna | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday advocated for a test of President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates in two U.S. states: Vermont and Massachusetts.Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, addressed a question about Trump's order for banks to voluntarily limit their interest rates for a year. The president had called for the lower rates to take effect Tuesday.Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified as defying Trump's proposal.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said Wednesday. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said. In earnings conference calls last week and behind the scenes, banks have pushed back against Trump's order this month to voluntarily forgo billions of dollars in revenue.Their main argument, that price controls will result in lenders canceling accounts for many card customers, has resonated with several Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Most banking analysts believe that Trump would need legislation to enact a nationwide cap on card rates.'A great idea'Dimon then said he had a \"great idea\" to help quell disagreement over the proposed card cap, suggesting that the U.S. government impose the pricing controls on Americans in just two states.Vermont and Massachusetts are the home states of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively, both of whom support a bill capping card rates at 10% for five years. Dimon didn't mention the lawmakers by name Wednesday.The U.S. government \"should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts, and see what happens,\" Dimon said, drawing laughter from the audience.Dimon said \"the left\" and people who argue for price controls \"will learn a real lesson, and the people crying the most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said.\"It'll be the restaurants, the retailers, the travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people miss their water payments,\" he said. \"It would be something else to watch.\"The offices of Sanders and Warren did not immediately return calls for comment.Dimon added that JPMorgan was planning on giving the Trump administration its analysis on what would happen under a national credit card rate cap.\"I think it's wrong for the government to get involved extensively in pricing of stuff, but I got to deal with the world I got,\" Dimon said.watch now",

    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube CEO Neal Mohan said reducing \"AI slop\" and detecting deepfakes are priorities for the Google-owned video site in 2026. \"It's becoming harder to detect what's real and what's AI-generated,\" Mohan wrote in his annual letter published Wednesday. \"This is particularly critical when it comes to deepfakes.\" With artificial intelligence penetrating every aspect of technology, Google has been investing heavily in building out the infrastructure to support new and growing workloads while also bolstering its Gemini models and adding AI features to its portfolio of business and consumer products. But as one of the leading sources of user-generated content on the internet, YouTube is dealing with an explosion in the number of videos created by AI. The term AI slop refers to the mass of low-quality AI content that's showing up across social media platforms. In addition to YouTube, companies such as Meta and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time.Mohan said the world is at an \"inflection point,\" where \"the lines between creativity and technology are blurring.\"\"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we're actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content,\" Mohan wrote. He said that YouTube clearly labels videos created by AI products and requires creators to disclose if they've produced altered content. The company's systems also remove \"harmful synthetic media\" that violates its guidelines, Mohan wrote. Critical to YouTube's growth among users, creators and advertisers is keeping the platform desirable for all parties involved. In December, YouTube said it would be expanding its \"likeness detection,\" which flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes. The feature is being rolled out to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program.Mohan's letter said the company will use AI as a tool and \"not a replacement,\" adding that on average more than 1 million YouTube channels used its artificial intelligence creation technology daily in December.The company is expanding the way creators can take advantage of AI, he said, including on YouTube's short-form video offering called Shorts, which competes with TikTok and Instagram Reels. \"This year you'll be able to create a Short using your own likeness, produce games with a simple text prompt, and experiment with music,\" he wrote. Mohan described creators as \"the new stars and studios,\" and said YouTube creators are \"buying studio-sized lots in Hollywood and beyond to pioneer new formats and produce beautifully produced, must-see TV.\"  The company also wants to provide new ways for creators to earn, from \"shopping and brand deals to fan funding features like Jewels and gifts.\"Another priority, Mohan said, is making YouTube \"the best place for kids and teens\" and said this year the company plans to make it easier for parents to set up new kid accounts and to easily switch between them.YouTube said in September that it's paid out more than $100 billion to creators, artists and media companies since 2021. Earlier in the year, analysts at MoffettNathanson estimated that If it was a stand-alone business, YouTube would be worth between $475 billion and $550 billion.WATCH: How Neal Mohan leads YouTube by putting creators firstwatch now",

    "body": "Warren Buffett, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCBerkshire Hathaway, with new CEO Greg Abel in charge, has taken a formal step toward unwinding a rare misstep by Warren Buffett.The conglomerate, which owns Geico insurance and BNSF Railway, registered its entire 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz in a filing that clears the way for Berkshire to exit its position in the hot dog and macaroni-and-cheese maker. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder.Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 7.5% at one point in Wednesday trading following the news.The move underscores Abel's willingness to move on from a deal that has long stood out as a rare blemish on Buffett's otherwise storied record. Kraft Heinz shares have plunged about 70% since the 2015 merger that created the ketchup-making giant, weighed down by shifting consumer tastes, rising costs and sluggish growth across core brands. Some of the loss has been offset with billions of dollars in dividends over the years, but last year Berkshire still took a $3.8 billion write-down on the value of its holding. \"We ... view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure,\" Greggory Warren, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note.The latest Berkshire filing also came as Kraft Heinz seeks to separate into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft cheese singles and Lunchables.Buffett himself has acknowledged his frustration with how the merger he orchestrated a decade ago ultimately unraveled.\"It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking them apart will fix it,\" Buffett, who remains Berkshire's chairman, told CNBC last year.The registration statement gives Berkshire the flexibility to reduce the position, rather than signaling an imminent sale, according to Stifel.\"The registration provides Berkshire Hathaway the ability to reduce its ownership stake; we believe transaction notifications are not required outside of quarterly 13F filings,\" Stifel analysts wrote. \"The next update is likely to be in mid-May, when Berkshire reports its first fiscal quarter activity.\"Stifel reiterated a hold rating on Kraft Heinz and a $26 price target, citing softer U.S. consumption trends and slower growth in emerging markets that could delay any revenue growth, even as the company continues to generate strong cash flow.In 2015, Berkshire teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the combined company struggled.",

    "body": "Homes under construction in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2025. Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage refinancing jumped sharply higher for the second straight week, as interest rates fell further, but that boom may be about to bust. Interest rates are now moving much higher.Last week, applications to refinance a home loan rose 20% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Applications were 183% higher than the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.16% from 6.18%, with points falling to 0.54 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest rate since September 2024.\"Mortgage rates declined further last week, driving another big week for refinance applications, which saw the strongest level of activity since September 2025,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. \"These lower rates prompted greater refinance activity from conventional and VA refinance borrowers, with increases of 29 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Refinance applications accounted for more than 60 percent of applications, and the average loan size also moved higher.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Rates initially dropped the week before last, after President Donald Trump said he would make mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy $200 billion of mortgage-backed bonds. Rates only fell 9 basis points across the two weeks, but the focus on it in the news may have caused an outsized reaction. The 30-year fixed was 86 basis points lower year over year.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 5% for the week and were 18% higher than the same week one year ago. Homebuyers are still contending with high home prices and continued uncertainty in the broader economy. There are more homes available for sale, but affordability, despite slightly lower rates, is still a major impediment. Interest rates moved much higher to start this week, as bond markets sold off following the Trump's threats of new tariffs and escalating tensions over Greenland. The average rate on the 30-year fixed jumped 14 basis points higher, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. \"This matches the level seen the day before the announcement of the administration's $200 billion mortgage bond buying plans. The last time rates were higher was December 23rd,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In light of that announcement, why aren't mortgage rates doing better? Simply put, the market has already reacted to that news to the extent allowed by its transparency.\"",

The social media company first tested ads on Threads with users in the U.S. and Japan last January. Since its launch in July 2023, Threads has been a direct competitor to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. Meta's service has amassed more than 400 million active monthly users globally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in August.Earlier this month, The Verge reported that Threads had lured more daily active users worldwide than X, citing data from Similarweb.

    "body": "Artificial intelligence startups OpenAI and Anthropic have their sights set on enterprise customers this year as they race to win more revenue, users and market share. In separate interviews with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar highlighted enterprise as a key revenue driver for their businesses. Enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business as of January, but Friar said she expects that figure to grow to closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology.  OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion since the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. \"We're an incredibly strong business today,\" Friar said Wednesday. \"As we look forward, for us, it's eyes on the prize of, 'How do we add value to the consumer? How do we add value to enterprises? And how do we close this capability gap?' You're going to hear us talk about this over and over again.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateAmodei said that while Anthropic offers consumer products, they are not the company's major focus. He attributed roughly 80% of Anthropic's business to enterprises and 20% to consumers, adding that the startup has embraced enterprises in part because they are a relatively predictable and stable source of income. \"Since the beginning, Anthropic has thought in terms of safety and reliability of AI systems, and one of the things we realized is that that was very synergistic with working with enterprises as compared to consumers,\" Amodei said.As of September, Anthropic had amassed more than 300,000 business customers, up from less than 1,000 two years prior. Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers in 2021, and its valuation has since climbed to $350 billion.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday urged U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation to limit credit card rates to 10%, following his social media post this month ordering banks to voluntarily lower their rates.\"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year, and this will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" Trump said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"They charge Americans interest rates of 28%, 30%, 31%, 32%,\" Trump said. \"Whatever happened to usury?\"Shares of banks climbed after the comments. The KBW Bank Index rose 2.2% in morning trading. Capital One, which relies on cards for most of its revenue, advanced 1.9%.Among the options that the Trump administration had for applying pressure to American banks over card rates, the legislative path may be the least threatening to the industry. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a bill last year that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years, but that proposal has stalled in Congress.Analysts including Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW have said it is unlikely that a card bill will have enough bipartisan support to become law. Lawmakers from Trump's own Republican Party, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have expressed caution when it comes to card price controls. \"If this is the path, the odds of implementation are low,\" Sakhrani said in an interview. \"There is a lot of Republican leadership that opposes the idea\" and other industries, including airlines and retailers, would be hurt by the policy.It's unclear whether pressure from Trump — who holds massive sway among GOP lawmakers — will improve the plan's chances of passing.Breaking 'the law?'The episode may show the limits of Trump's ability to cajole the financial industry into voluntarily giving up billions of dollars in revenue to support his election year affordability push.After Trump's Jan. 9 Truth Social post on the rate cap, banks said on earnings conference calls that such a limit would have unintended consequences, including that lenders would simply cancel accounts for many card customers, especially those with lower credit scores.The president told reporters that lenders who didn't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" but behind closed doors, bankers countered that they were already compliant with the law. Privately, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC they hoped to fend off the president's request, given the difficulty of passing legislation. Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified. KBW's Sakhrani said he wasn't aware of any major card player that cut its rates.On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told a Davos audience that the U.S. government should test out the rate cap in just two states, Vermont and Massachusetts. Those are the home states of Sanders and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have both championed interest rate caps.Doing so would teach \"a real lesson\" to those in favor of price controls, Dimon said.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said.",

The company said it will provide data speeds of \"up to 6 terabits per second\" from satellites positioned in low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit, regions of space that are between 100 miles and 21,000 miles from the Earth's surface. Blue Origin said it expects to begin deploying its constellation in the fourth quarter of 2027. Bezos is entering an increasingly crowded satellite internet market that's currently dominated by Starlink, a service operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Starlink has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers.

The service recently rebranded from Project Kuiper to Leo. The company has sent up 180 satellites since last April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners such as United Launch Alliance and SpaceX. Several future deployments are expected to be handled by Blue Origin. Amazon aims to build a constellation of 3,236 low-Earth satellites that will serve businesses, governments and consumers. Last November, the company opened up an \"enterprise preview\" to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch.  Bezos predicted in 2024 that Blue Origin would one day be a bigger company than Amazon. He founded Blue Origin in 2000 and Dave Limp, Amazon's former devices boss, serves as its CEO. \"I think it's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in, but it's going to take a while,\" Bezos said in a 2024 interview at The New York Times' DealBook Summit.Blue Origin is primarily a rocket launch company, flying tourists and research to the edge of space on short trips. Last January, the startup notched a major milestone when it successfully launched its towering New Glenn rocket for the first time, though it was unable to return part of the booster back to a launchpad for reuse.  watch now",

    "body": "Dr. Stephanie Long (right), MD, of One Medical Group takes the blood pressure of Danielle Greene (left), who is 20 weeks pregnant, during a prenatal appointment on Thursday, February 4, 2016 in San Francisco, Calif.Lea Suzuki | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesAmazon on Wednesday rolled out an artificial intelligence health-care assistant for members of its primary care chain One Medical, joining the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, which recently launched similar features.The tool, called Health AI, uses large language models from Amazon's Bedrock service to answer questions and provide members with personalized advice based on their medical records, lab results and current medications. It can also assist with managing medications and book appointments with a user's One Medical provider. The tool pulls answers from a variety of sources, including licensed and proprietary data, knowledge verified by medical experts and in some cases, publicly-available data, Amazon said.Health AI appears in the app for One Medical, the health-care company Amazon acquired for $3.9 billion in 2023. One Medical runs brick-and-mortar clinics and also offers some telehealth services to members who pay between $99 and $199 a year for its services.Amazon said Health AI isn't intended to provide diagnosis or treatment, and it shouldn't replace a doctor's visit. The tool is \"programmed with clinical protocols\" that identify when symptoms or conditions require escalation to a provider or for an in-person visit, the company said.Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateConversations with Health AI also aren't added to a patient's medical records, Amazon said. The company began testing Health AI among a subset of One Medical members last Spring before rolling out the tool more broadly.Other AI providers have also jumped into the lucrative health-care market. Earlier this month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, a feature within its chatbot that enables users to upload medical records and receive personalized advice. Anthropic released its Claude for Healthcare feature shortly after. Amazon said Health AI is easier for patients to use because it doesn't require them to upload documents or connect outside apps, and it's \"more actionable\" compared to other offerings.\"In short: other AI health chatbots provide general health information,\" Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, told CNBC in a statement. \"One Medical's Health AI assistant knows your health story, can take actions based on a patient's request, and keeps your trusted providers in the lead. It's the difference between getting answers and getting care.\"Amazon has pushed deeper into health-care over the past decade. In addition to acquiring One Medical, Amazon also bought online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million in 2018. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy.The company said Health AI may direct users to One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy services \"where it is helpful,\" but protected health information isn't used to market or advertise general merchandise from its broader webstore.   watch now",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department showing Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein. Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of JusticeFormer President Bill Clinton was set to tell the House Oversight Committee on Friday morning in testimony about Jeffrey Epstein that \"I saw nothing and I did nothing wrong\" during their times flying together or socializing.\"First, I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,\" Clinton planned to say during his closed-door deposition, which was underway in Chappaqua, New York.\"No matter how many photos you show me, I have two things that at the end of the day matter more than your interpretation of those 20-year-old photos. I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn't see,\" Clinton said to say.\"I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn't do,\" he planned to say. \"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.\"\"As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing — I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,\" Clinton planned to say. \"But even with 20/20 hindsight, I saw nothing that ever gave me pause.\"Clinton also blasted the committee for forcing his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify about the notorious sex predator Epstein on Thursday. The committee issued subpoenas to both Clintons demanding their testimony, and threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress if they failed to comply.Hillary Clinton says she has told the panel that she neither recalls ever meeting Epstein, or having knowledge of his sexual abuse of young women and underage girls.\"Before we start, I have to get personal,\" Bill Clinton said, according to prepared testimony that his X account posted.\"You made Hillary come in. She had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of even meeting him,\" the former president was set to say. \"She neither traveled with him nor visited any of his properties. Whether you subpoenaed 10 people or 10,000, including her was simply not right.\"The House Oversight Committee has not sought testimony from President Donald Trump about Epstein.The two men were friends for years before falling out in the early 2000s.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal child sex trafficking charges, during Trump's first presidential administration.Epstein killed himself weeks later in a federal jail in New York City.Trump said that millions of documents related to Epstein that were recently released by the Department of Justice exonerated him of any wrongdoing.Trump for months last year opposed the bill in Congress that would force the DOJ to release those files. He dropped his opposition when it became clear Congress would pass that bill, and then he signed it into law in late November.",

The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said in a short statement Friday that a truce had taken effect in southern Ukraine to enable the restoration of the 330-kilovolt supply line to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\"Demining activities are ongoing to ensure safe access for the repair teams,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on social media.The local ceasefire, which the IAEA said it had helped to secure, comes shortly after the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of the invasion. Situated in the southeast of the country, the plant is Ukraine's largest and houses six of its 15 operational nuclear power reactors. It has recently been reliant on external power to sustain all essential nuclear safety functions. Both sides have accused each other of raising the risk of a catastrophic accident by staging attacks near to the plant.Russian nuclear power company Rosatom said Friday that IAEA specialists located at the power plant were monitoring repairs to the disconnected power line, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.Ukraine's Foreign Ministry had not responded to CNBC's request for comment as this article went live.View of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant from right bank of Dnipro river.

    "body": "Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., gestures at the United Center, on Day 1 of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Aug. 19, 2024.Mike Segar | ReutersHouse Democrats this week laid out their plans to counter President Donald Trump's rhetoric about \"nationalizing\" this year's elections ahead of the 2026 midterms. The lawmakers convened at their annual policy retreat, where they set their agenda for the year and hone campaign messaging. They met in northern Virginia this week following Trump's escalating calls for voter-ID requirements at the polls and his desire to require presenting documents to register to vote, both changes that would likely disenfranchise voters across the U.S. A pending Supreme Court decision on the Voting Rights Act also looms large, and Trump has said he is considering ways of imposing the changes he wants even if Congress does not pass legislation.\"This is a five alarm fire,\" Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said at a Congressional Black Caucus press conference at the retreat's close on Friday. \"We are going to fight back, and we are going to use every tool in the toolkit.\"Sewell, who is also a member of the House Administration Committee that has jurisdiction over federal elections, said options include litigating, legislating and mobilizing. But with a minority in both chambers, Democrats are somewhat limited in the run-up to the pivotal 2026 midterm elections that will decide control of the House.\"The vast majority of Americans support President Trump's commonsense election integrity agenda, Democrat politicians should too,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an emailed statement. Trump in recent months has again become laser-focused on elections, rehashing some of his old, unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential contest being \"rigged\" and noncitizens voting. It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and instances are rare. The FBI in January seized ballots in Fulton County, Ga., a precinct that Trump lost to Joe Biden.The president has recently called to \"nationalize\" elections. He has pushed for the Senate to pass a controversial bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register and photo identification to cast a ballot. \"President Trump is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,\" Jackson said in her statement. \"[The] President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.\"Trump threatened earlier this month to unilaterally impose voter ID restrictions ahead of November's elections. MS NOW reported Thursday that he has instructed White House lawyers to review the feasibility of such an order. And the Washington Post reported that a group of pro-Trump activist is circulating a draft executive order to effectuate that goal that is premised on Chinese interference in the 2020 election.Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said these attempts have \"shaky\" legal footing. \"I'm deeply skeptical of any evidence that they suddenly have six years later,\" Morelle said in an interview at the retreat.Morelle, in his capacity as the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, is leading House Democrats' response to the Trump administration's elections priorities. He's also preparing for the potential fallout from a challenge to a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that, if upheld, could eliminate some majority-minority Democratic-held districts. The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on that case sometime between now and June.That Democratic effort includes war-gaming different potential election scenarios, working on litigation and crafting messaging, Morelle said. Sewell, meanwhile, said the CBC has held several all-day sessions on the topic of voting rights to help hone its response.\"One of the things I think we really need to focus on, especially in the wake of the seizure of the ballots in Fulton County, is there's got to be a strong legal basis that we lay out now that's in objection to what they're doing on that front,\" Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., said at the CBC press conference.Democrats also articulated fears that Trump could deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and National Guard members to polling places as a means of voter suppression in November. \"Every year we do a grassroots piece where you have people, poll watchers and the like. But it's got to be supercharged, on steroids this time around,\" Ivey said. \"We've seen this movie before. It's been a long time since it was this overt, but I think we have to have people who are trained and ready to be in all of these polling places.\"Saving democracy vs. affordability?Democrats were laser focused on cost-of-living issues throughout the retreat, which included appearances by Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger and organized labor leaders. Affordability is already shaping up to be a key message to voters for Democrats this year.But Morelle said members are \"acutely attuned\" to potential threats to elections. Most of the conversations he had during the retreat were related to election security, he said.Still, after their message on Trump's threats to democracy fell flat in the 2024 cycle, they face a strategic challenge: Does raising the election issue take away from their messaging on the economy? \"You can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a member of the CBC and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in an interview. Affordability is the top concern, Waters said, but \"Democrats have to be very concerned about what the president is doing — it is literally voter suppression.\"Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee and a former member of the House Jan. 6 Select Committee, and Morelle both said Democrats do not have to choose one or the other.\"I don't buy the argument that we either have to talk about popular democracy or we have to talk about middle-class affordability,\" Raskin said in an interview. \"To me, these are the same issue. We need government that is going to be an instrument for the common good of all the people, and not an instrument for the corrupt self enrichment of the guy who gets in and his family and his friends.\"\"I don't think [Americans] think about it sort of in an esoteric, theoretical way, 'democracy needs to be defended,'\" Morelle said. \"I think what they are growing in their awareness is, our access to the ballot has a great deal to do with the decisions that will affect the bottom line for my family.\"",

Democrats remain committed to keep fighting for real reforms to rein in ICE and stop the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said in a statement.The negotiations over DHS funding are heightened after federal immigration agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens during an immigration surge in Minneapolis, though the Trump administration has since said it would wind down the operation. Democrats are demanding changes to DHS' immigration enforcement tactics. They want to bar federal immigration agents from wearing masks, mandate body cameras and require them to obtain judicial warrants to search homes, among other proposed changes. The White House and Republicans have pushed back on the mask ban and judicial warrant requirement.Senate Democrats on Monday for the second time blocked a House-passed DHS funding bill, as negotiations dragged on.\"Yesterday, the White House made another serious counter offer. Democrats need to make a move to end the shutdown before more Americans are harmed by a lack of funding for critical services like disaster relief,\" a White House official said on Friday.Despite the shutdown, most DHS employees are deemed essential and continue to work. Parts of the agency are funded through last year's sprawling tax and spending bill. But some employees, including those at DHS subagencies like the Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency, could be forced to work without pay if the shutdown continues.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem is schedule to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., speaks during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, on Friday, June 4, 2021.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlock CEO Jack Dorsey's move to cut nearly half the company's workforce is shining a spotlight on a growing question for corporate America: whether advances in artificial intelligence will ultimately mean fewer workers.In an earnings call Thursday, Dorsey said Block will cut about 4,000 jobs.Dorsey framed the move as more than a cost-cutting exercise, instead describing a shift in how companies operate as artificial intelligence becomes more central to business decisions.He also suggested other companies will follow suit.\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said. \"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.\"Economists, however, question whether such moves signal a broader shift in the labor market or simply reflect company-specific adjustments.\"This is a function of lax judgment during a period of rapid expansion and the retrenchment that follows,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"It should be understood within the unique context of that firm, and it does not signal risk to the broader U.S. labor market.\"Doubts about jobsThe layoffs come amid broader questions about the employment picture.Though job cuts have remained low and the unemployment rate is a relatively healthy 4.3%, openings have contracted sharply and hiring in 2025 largely flatlined, with average payroll growth of just 15,000.Still, the tech-related picture looks relatively healthy.The information sector, one proxy for the tech industry, saw its unemployment rate fall to 5% in January, down 0.7 percentage point from a year ago. Job openings have declined in the sector, but demand for some roles remains firm: Postings in software development are up 12% from a year ago, according to Indeed.Most economists remain sanguine on the labor market, even in the current \"low-hire, low-fire\" environment. Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, said Friday on CNBC that while it is \"healthy\" to discuss AI's potential impact, it is important not to overinterpret individual company decisions.\"I would not extrapolate from Block to the whole U.S. economy,\" Sahm said. \"It's important to understand that these AI tools — the direction you go with them really depends on the leadership. Automation, mass layoffs is not necessarily the only path forward.\"AI's broad impactA widely-discussed speech earlier this week by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller also underscored the challenges and opportunities AI presents.While discussing the Fed's internal use of the technology, Waller said AI is more likely to enhance productivity than eliminate jobs outright.\"When ATMs were first introduced, they didn't eliminate bank tellers. Instead, they changed how banking worked,\" he said. \"The real impact wasn't automation alone — it was how institutions reorganized around technology. AI is similar. The biggest gains won't come from simply adding AI to existing processes. They'll come from rethinking workflows, roles and systems.\"But even if layoffs are not yet widespread — and Dorsey's warnings are not necessarily a broad harbinger — companies are beginning to rethink how they allocate resources.Tech jobs account for only about 5% to 7% of the total labor force, but AI technology itself is spreading far beyond the sector.\"Some jobs are apt to be disrupted by AI\" as companies reconsider the balance between labor and technology, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at Indeed Hiring Lab.\"Companies are really shifting their investments toward capital spending and away from labor,\" Ullrich added. \"They're investing in AI with the hope that it can replace jobs.\"",

Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Friday said that \"I'd love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, \"but sometimes you have to.\"But Trump also said, \"We haven't made a final decision\" on whether to attack Iran.\"We'll see what happens,\" he said. \"We're talking later today. We'll have some additional talks today.\"Trump's comment to reporters outside the White House came after he expressed frustration at Iran's refusal to comply with American demands to curb its nuclear program.\"We're not thrilled with the way they're negotiating,\" Trump said. \"They cannot have nuclear weapons.\"\"I'm not happy that they're not willing to give us what we have to have,\" Trump said, referring to that condition.Asked by a reporter if there could be a long, drawn-out conflict in the Middle East if the United States attacks Iran, Trump said, \"I guess you could say there's always a risk.\"\"It'd be wonderful if they negotiate, really, in good conscience, good faith,\" he said. \"They are not getting there so far.\"Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, met in Washington, D.C., with Vice President JD Vance and other American officials in a bid to avoid war. A statement issued by Oman's government after the meeting put a positive spin on those talks that was not reflected in Trump's blunt comments.\"The meeting examined the indirect US-Iran negotiations sponsored by the Sultanate of Oman, alongside the diplomatic endeavours seeking to culminate in a just and enduring agreement concerning the nuclear file and to guarantee the peaceful character of Iran's nuclear energy program,\" Oman's government said.\"I am grateful for their engagement and look forward to further and decisive progress in the coming days,\" al-Busaidi said in a post on X. \"Peace is within our reach.\"During an interview with MS Now,  when asked if there was a chance of the United States attacking Iran overnight, al-Busaidi said, \"I can't answer that question, because I don't know.\"\"I think President Trump is sincerely passionate for a deal,\" al-Busaidi said. \"He wants to have a deal. He wants to have a diplomatic solution, and this is what we are trying to do.\"But Trump, in a speech later Friday afternoon in Corpus Christi, Texas, said of Iran, \"We have a very big decision.\"\"We have a country that's been 47 years blowing people's legs off, arms off,\" Trump said. They've been knocking out ships, killing people, lots of people, not only Americans, lots of people.\"Trump said he wanted to \"make a deal that's meaningful.\"\"I'd rather do it the peaceful way,\" Trump said, while calling Iran's government \"very difficult people, dangerous people, very difficult people.\"The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem earlier Friday authorized non-emergency U.S. government personnel and their family members to leave Israel \"due to safety risks.\"Also Friday, the massive American aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, arrived off Israel's coast.Also on Friday, the State Department said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would visit Israel on Monday and Tuesday to discuss Iran and other regional issues.",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersUBS' top equity strategist dialed back his view on U.S. stocks, citing mounting risks from a weakening dollar, stretched valuations and policy turbulence in Washington.Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at the investment bank, downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\" in a fully invested global equity portfolio, arguing that the factors that powered years of outperformance are starting to fade.The dollar risk is a central concern, Garthwaite wrote. UBS forecasts the euro climbing to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter and sees \"asymmetric structural downside risks\" to the greenback. Historically, when the dollar's trade-weighted index falls 10%, U.S. equities underperform by roughly 4% in unhedged terms, according to the bank. Foreign markets are trouncing the U.S. this year as a weaker dollar and cheaper valuations draw capital overseas. The MSCI World ex-US index has gained about 8% in 2026, compared with the little changed performance for the S&P 500. Japan's Nikkei 225 has rallied 17% year to date, while the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7%, underscoring a sharp rotation away from American equities. U.S. stocks struggled again Friday as investors fretted over the potential downsides of the artificial intelligence build-out and persistent inflation at home.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 year to dateAnother pillar of U.S. stock strength — corporate buybacks — is also losing its edge, the bank said. The buyback yield in the U.S. is now only roughly on par with global peers, eroding what had been a key support for earnings per share growth and investor flows, UBS said. The combined shareholder yield from dividends and buybacks in the U.S. is now about half that of Europe, the bank said.\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" Garthwaite wrote.Valuations add to the unease. UBS calculates that the sector-adjusted price-earnings ratio for U.S. stocks is 35% above international peers, versus an average premium of about 4% since 2010. Roughly 60% of sectors trade not only at higher multiples than their global counterparts but also above their own historical premium, the strategist wrote.Policy volatility under President Donald Trump is another headwind. This year has brought shifts in tariff policy, proposals to cap credit card interest rates, potential limits on private equity investment in housing, renewed scrutiny of drug pricing, and suggestions to curb dividends and buybacks for defense companies, UBS said.Still, the noted strategist stopped short of turning outright bearish. Garthwaite said the U.S. economy and equities tend to benefit more than peers when markets are in the early phases of a potential bubble. The bank also expects artificial intelligence adoption to outpace most other major regions, with the possible exception of China, helping sustain earnings growth across key industries.UBS strategist Sean Simonds set a year-end target of 7,500 for the S&P 500, compared with an average forecast of 7,629 among 14 top strategists, according to CNBC Pro's strategist survey.

    "body": "watch nowWholesale prices rose at a faster-than-expected pace in January, countering hopes that inflation was easing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The core producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8%, more than the 0.6% gain in December and well ahead of the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 0.3%.On an all-items basis, the headline PPI rose 0.5%, also above the forecast for 0.3% and 0.1 percentage point more than the prior month.For the full year, core wholesale prices accelerated 3.6%, while the headline index posted a 2.9% gain. Both figures are well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal and suggest that rising prices are still a factor for the U.S. economy.Stock market futures added to losses following the report. Services prices primarily drove the increase, with a 0.8% monthly rise that was the highest since July 2025. By contrast, goods prices actually fell 0.3%, though core goods prices climbed 0.7%.More than 20% of the increase in services came from margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. On the goods side, energy and food prices both fell while metals prices rose 4.8%.Trade services prices surged 2.5%, helping boost pressures on wholesale inflation.The report comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation has been tamed. Pipeline pressures as indicated by the PPI figures could keep the Fed cautious as it weighs its next moves on interest rates. Markets largely expect the Fed to stay on the sidelines until the summer, though Trump and other White House officials have pushed for lower rates.Economists have worried that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher, though Fed officials largely expect the impact to be temporary. There was some evidence of tariffs in the PPI data, with indexes for apparel and other goods such as intermediate components moving higher.Trump lost a key Supreme Court ruling that overturned his move to use emergency measures to implement the tariffs. However, the president has cited other authorities that will allow him to implement the duties anyway.",

She told reporters later that she testified she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and that she had no knowledge of his crimes.House Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Thursday told reporters that it is \"very possible\" that the panel will subpoena Lutnick to testify.Comer has not called President Donald Trump to testify.Trump, who had a longtime friendship with Epstein before the two men fell out in the early 2000s, has said that the recently released files on Epstein by the DOJ exonerate him of any wrongdoing.MS Now reported earlier this week that the DOJ withheld from public disclosure memos and notes about FBI interviews, including those of a woman who has alleged that Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor.The DOJ, in response to that and other similar reporters, had said, \"If files are temporarily pulled for victim redactions or to redact Personally Identifiable Information, then those documents are promptly  restored online and are publicly available.\"Lutnick, in testimony on Feb. 10, to the Senate Appropriations Committee, admitted that he and his family had lunch with Epstein in December 2012 at Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sits to testify before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing to examine a review of broadband deployment funding at the Department of Commerce, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 10, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersLutnick's testimony came after he had claimed that he cut off contact with his New York City neighbor Epstein in 2005, three years before Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.DOJ files show that Lutnick remained in communication with Epstein years later.MS Now reported on Feb. 10 that, \"In 2015, Lutnick appeared to invite Epstein to an 'intimate' fundraising event for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which Lutnick had been fundraising for at the time.\"\"In 2017, Epstein donated $50,000 to a New York charity in honor of Lutnick, according to the files,\" MS Now reported.Documents also indicate that Epstein and Lutnick \"each signed on behalf of limited liability companies that agreed on Dec. 28, 2012, to acquire stakes in a now-shuttered advertising technology company called Adfin,\" CBS News reported previously.Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Friday dismissed the Trump administration's request to eliminate a student loan repayment plan that lowered monthly bills for millions of borrowers.Judge John Ross of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order dismissing the multistate lawsuit blocking the enactment of the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, federal student loan repayment plan.The Trump administration's failed bid to block the SAVE plan means that borrowers should have access to the program's benefits, at least for now, consumer advocates said. Those include lower monthly payments and a faster timeline to forgiveness.\"As of today, not only is there no legal barrier to delivering those rights through the SAVE plan, but the secretary has a legal obligation to do so,\" said Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at Protect Borrowers.

Here's whyCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedMore than 7 million student loan borrowers remain enrolled in the SAVE plan, as of the fourth quarter, according to the Education Department. Those borrowers were placed in forbearance during the legal challenges, meaning they didn't owe monthly payments. Their loans have been accruing interest since August.The court order may be a temporary reprieve, and it's unclear how the Trump administration will respond. President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out the SAVE plan as of July 1, 2028. How the SAVE plan worksThe Biden administration introduced the SAVE plan in 2023, billing the program as \"the most affordable repayment plan ever created.\" But just as many of the SAVE plan's benefits were taking effect, Republican-led legal challenges put the program on hold. One of the hallmarks of SAVE is a faster timeline to forgiveness compared to other income-driven repayment, or IDR, plans, which typically offer forgiveness after 20 to 25 years. Under the SAVE plan, borrowers who originally took out $12,000 or less are eligible to have their loans forgiven after 10 years of monthly payments. For every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount, the repayment period increases by one year — up to 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for graduate loans.For example, an undergraduate borrower with a starting balance of $15,000 would need to make payments on SAVE for 13 years in order to qualify for loan forgiveness.Another benefit of SAVE was lower payments than those under other IDR plans.Monthly payments on SAVE were originally capped at 10% of discretionary income, and slated to drop to 5% of discretionary income in 2024. Borrowers with incomes at or below the federal poverty level would qualify for $0 monthly payments.The SAVE plan also includes a cap on interest. Any interest that accrues above a borrower's monthly payment is waived. If $50 in interest accumulates on your loans in a month, but your payment is only $30, you won't be charged the additional $20, for example. Borrowers who qualify for $0 monthly payments would not see additional interest charges on their debt.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersPresident Donald Trump is careening toward the Make America Healthy Again iceberg after issuing an executive order to boost the domestic production of a key herbicide called glyphosate. Democrats see an opportunity to steer the health-conscious movement back to their side. Trump strode into a second term in the White House after former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped his independent bid for president and endorsed him. Kennedy's MAHA movement, which disavows chemicals in food and pushes natural alternatives, played a key part in Trump's victory — and Trump rewarded Kennedy by making him Health and Human Services secretary.But Trump's recent moves that benefit the very chemicals MAHA hates are creating fissures in the base that helped deliver him to the White House, with less than nine months to go until the pivotal midterm elections and primary elections starting next week. Democrats who hope to strip Trump's near-total control of Washington now see an opportunity to claw MAHA back into their fold. \"What the President did in the EO, and sort of saying, you know, 'trust me on this one, we'll get to it later,' has really angered a lot of people,\" Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, the top appropriator on the panel with oversight over the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview with CNBC. \"It does create some huge opportunities for candidates who are willing to talk about the health of our diet, 'food is medicine' [and] toxic chemicals in our environment.\"Pingree is pushing a bill to revoke the executive order on glyphosate with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and has long advocated against chemicals in food. At issue for MAHA is not only last week's executive order to spur glyphosate, the main chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's herbicide Roundup, which has been linked in the past to cancer, but is still deemed safe by the EPA. MAHA advocates say the White House and Republicans have spurned them at multiple turns.The administration has also sided with Bayer-Monsanto in a Supreme Court case that would weaken petitioners' ability to sue if they believe they got cancer from a pesticide or herbicide. And congressional Republicans are pushing a new farm bill with what MAHA advocates argue is a \"liability shield\" for chemical manufacturers. \"This EO is feeling very, very much like the breaking point,\" said Kelly Ryerson, a MAHA advocate who is known by the moniker \"Glyphosate Girl.\" \"People can't continue to make excuses for the administration and saying, 'well, you know, they'll get to it or whatever it is,' because it's just not happening.\"Kelly Ryerson, known by her supporters as \"Glyphosate Girl,\" poses for a portrait, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026, in Miami.Marta Lavandier | APRyerson said the contingent of MAHA that she sees fleeing the Trump administration is the independents who supported Kennedy and the Democrats who crossed the aisle to support Trump in the hopes that he would make good on Kennedy's health agenda. \"That is a very, very, very real, very large contingent of the group, and very concerning in terms of going into midterms now,\" Ryerson said.  Many in the MAHA movement were initially aligned with Democrats. Some worked to elect former President Barack Obama, making the embrace of Trump especially shocking for Democrats. Republicans have traditionally aligned with chemical manufacturers and big agricultural interests on pesticides and herbicides, supporting the industries' desire for less oversight and regulation.\"I've had conversations with people who are, you know, very engaged in the MAHA movement, who say, 'Are there Democrats who support these things besides you?'\" Pingree said. \"I'm like, holy s---, like how have we missed the boat here? … We have huge numbers of people who will sign on to legislation like this or support these kinds of issues.\" Pingree said she's encouraging her caucus to speak more often on MAHA issues and trying to find them opportunities to engage on the issue.U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) speaks at a press conference hosted by the Climate Action Campaign outside of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025.Bryan Dozier | AFP | Getty ImagesOther Democrats are taking the opportunity to engage, as well. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said in an interview in the Capitol that the administration's move represents an opportunity for Democrats. \"I think the answer is yes, especially given the fact that Kennedy has basically thrown his own people under the bus completely,\" Heinrich said. \"We need to demonstrate that we're actively working on those issues and that we'll do it in a way that will be consistent and predictable.\" \"This whole practice of using glyphosate to desiccate crops before you turn them into Cheerios, that does not play well in New Mexico,\" Heinrich said, noting a particularly hot-button issue for MAHA.

Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat who has been vocal on MAHA and was \"excited\" by RFK's appointment as health secretary, told CNBC in a statement that he has \"always been supportive of getting rid of harmful pesticides in our food to make Americans safer.\"\"RFK Jr. used to feel that way too, and it's incredibly disappointing to see that he and the administration are turning their backs on Americans this way,\" Polis said. \"The President's decision to side with large scale chemical manufacturers ultimately makes Americans less healthy.\"Kennedy has backed the administration's executive order on glyphosate, despite once winning a $290 million case for a man who said he got cancer from the chemical. In a lengthy statement on X this week, he said it is necessary to bring \"chemical production back to the United States and end our near-total reliance on adversarial nations.\" He noted the administration's commitment to regenerative agriculture, which eschews traditional chemical applications in favor of practices that enhance soil health, as one pillar of the strategy.\"If these inputs disappeared overnight, crop yields would fall, food prices would surge, and America would experience a massive loss of farms even beyond what we are witnessing today,\" Kennedy said, blaming Washington for entrenching big ag in chemical use. \"We are now changing course — without destabilizing the food supply.\"U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks to the media following U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 24, 2026. Kylie Cooper | ReutersWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement that the Trump administration has delivered for MAHA on \"removing artificial ingredients from our food supply, overhauling the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, re-examining baby formula, and more.\"\"Democrats long talked about health issues, but President Trump and his Administration have actually delivered – and will continue delivering on the MAHA agenda,\" Desai said. \"The President's executive order to shore up domestic production of elemental phosphorous, which is necessary to manufacture military equipment and other cutting-edge technology, is not going to change our commitment to Make America Healthy Again.\"Ryerson did not say that the MAHA movement was abandoning Trump and Kennedy altogether yet, leaving the door open for a course correction. She also noted Kennedy's role at HHS does not have jurisdiction over pesticides, which are managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.But she warned time is running out for the administration to act.\"There is no evidence at this moment to point to any moves whatsoever to limit these chemical exposures, and the only way I see the White House and Republican Party being able to make up for this in time for midterms is with a very real, very large move to finally do something protective,\" she said. Among those potential moves to appease MAHA would be a ban on pre-harvest desiccation, a process where weed killers are applied to crops before harvest to make harvesting easier. She also urged the administration to revoke its support for Bayer-Monsanto at the Supreme Court and to invest in regenerative agriculture.  It's less clear whether Republicans who have dominated in agricultural districts for years are ready to meet MAHA where it's at. \"They've gone through the science, they'll continue to go through the science on this and we gotta bring it back to the science and the facts and the common sense,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \"Of course it has to be safe, and that's fine to always look at it, but let's make sure we're dealing with the science.\" \"If you just upended the ability to use it, you would dramatically affect the food supply, and that is the reality,\" Hoeven said.

    "body": "An American flag flies at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California, on Sept. 12, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board may have enriched its shareholders Thursday when it chose Paramount Skydance's acquisition offer over Netflix's, but it also terrified a lot of its employees.While some of those people own WBD shares and may prefer the financials of Paramount's $31-per-share bid to Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer, CNBC spoke to 10 WBD employees in a variety of different roles at the company. All 10, who asked not to be named for fear of potential backlash, expressed concerns about potential job losses and questions of who would ultimately run their divisions if Paramount and WBD are eventually merged.\"It's fair to say people are deflated by the news,\" said one long-term WBD executive.Nonetheless, a WBD-Paramount merger \"is not a done deal,\" as California Attorney General Rob Bonta said yesterday. The transaction must gain regulatory approval both in the U.S. and in Europe. WBD CEO David Zaslav acknowledged at an all-hands meeting Friday that the deal may still be blocked and expressed sympathy for those experiencing a sense of whiplash going from Netflix to Paramount, according to people familiar with the matter.\"The deal may not close. If it doesn't close, we get $7 billion, and we get back to work,\" Zaslav said, according to leaked audio provided to Business Insider. watch nowStill, several WBD employees told CNBC they wished Netflix had acquired WBD, citing several factors.While Paramount and WBD both have core competencies in news, sports, theatrical film and streaming TV, Netflix has far less overlap. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos repeatedly said he planned to leave the WBD business alone, keeping its theatrical business separate from Netflix while also keeping HBO Max as a separate, independent streaming service for the foreseeable future. Netflix also wasn't acquiring WBD's linear cable business with its bid. Employees at CNN, TNT Sports and the old Discovery networks would have remained in their jobs to forge a path as a standalone publicly traded company.Now, WBD employees are staring at potentially massive job cuts. Paramount executives have previously stated they plan to cut $6 billion by eliminating \"duplicative operations\" on \"back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure, et cetera,\" according to Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon. Both WBD and Paramount have already gone through thousands of job cuts in recent years. There are also questions about culture and leadership. While Mark Thompson currently runs CNN, Bari Weiss is the editor-in-chief at CBS News and could plausibly have CNN added to her purview. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Paramount CEO David Ellison promised President Donald Trump he'd make sweeping changes at CNN if he gained control of the network. Three CNN employees who spoke with CNBC said there's rampant fear among their colleagues about Weiss making dramatic changes to the cable network's anchors and tone.\"Despite all the speculation you've read during this process, I'd suggest that you don't jump to conclusions about the future until we know more,\" Thompson wrote in a memo to employees Thursday. CNN media reporter Brian Stelter noted CNN \"is a highly profitable business, and it would be foolish for any owner to put that at risk.\"On the entertainment side, WBD employees fear there may be too many proverbial cooks in the kitchen, which could bog down creativity and innovation for both film and TV. One WBD executive noted that Paramount's President Jeff Shell, Chair of Direct to Consumer Cindy Holland and Chair of TV George Cheeks are all used to being senior leaders in their organizations. Shell was CEO of NBCUniversal. Cheeks was co-CEO of Paramount before it merged with Skydance. Holland was a top executive at Netflix, where she worked for 18 years. How that mix meshes with WBD's entertainment leadership group is an open question and could lead to culture clashes.TNT Sports is run by Luis Silberwasser and has largely steered WBD toward younger audiences with its programming decisions and investments, including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights. CBS Sports, meanwhile, is driven by the demographics of those who watch CBS and has historically catered to an older audience. This could lead to culture clash, or the divisions could mesh nicely as complementary assets.While Silberwasser will have to work with CBS Sports President David Berson on employee duplications, like every other department, there's some reason for optimism in the sports division, because WBD and CBS have worked together for many years producing March Madness, the NCAA men's basketball tournament. That's given the units some degree of familiarity with each other. WBD also lost NBA rights last season. Combining with CBS' robust portfolio of sports rights, including the NFL and the Masters, makes WBD a major player again in sports, even if it's as a subsidiary of CBS. One other repeated concern among employees is the $64 billion in debt coming as part of the $111 billion enterprise value for the deal. Several employees said servicing large debt loads has hindered WBD in recent years, and they feared this could lead to more of the same. Two employees noted there's comfort being a part of a giant company like Netflix, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion. Paramount Skydance's market valuation is just $15 billion. ",

The company posted $33.38 billion in revenue for the quarter, topping a forecast of $31.73 billion.The company estimates fiscal 2027 revenue will come in between $138 billion and $142 billion, blowing away the $124.7 billion expected by Factset.Dell expects revenue for its artificial intelligence servers to hit $50 billion in 2027, more than double the year prior. With memory chip makers prioritizing the high-bandwidth memory needed for AI chips made by companies including Nvidia, AMD and Google, it has meant less supply for the makers of laptops and smartphones.Dell COO Jeff Clarke told analysts on the company's earnings call that Dell is working with memory partners \"to be as flexible and as agile as possible.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTrump administration blacklists Anthropic as AI firm refuses Pentagon demandsHow Amazon's massive stake in OpenAI could boost its AI and cloud businessesBlock laying off more than 4,000 employees, nearly half of its workforceNintendo bets more than ever on franchises like Mario to drive Switch 2 salesDell started to increase prices for its PCs last year to manage surging costs and CFO David Kennedy said on the earnings call that the company has priced to \"offset\" the pressure from those costs.\"Customers are assessing their needs and priorities in an environment where component demand is outpacing supply, which is elevating input costs and extending lead times,\" Kennedy said.But analysts have raised concerns about those price hikes weighing on demand moving forward.\"While the near term is clearly strong, we are unsure of the demand elasticity created by the swift and significant price actions taken by Dell,\" Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note Thursday.The bank reiterated its buy rating on the stock and upped its price objective from $135 to $155.Earlier this week, shares of competitor PC maker HP Inc. hit a 52-week low after the company reported earnings and noted pressure from increased memory prices.HP CFO Karen Parkhill said on the company's earning call that memory costs have risen roughly 100% sequentially, and the company expects that increase to continue into the fiscal year.

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCoreweave CEO Mike Intrator backed up the company's massive spending plans during an interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday as shares dropped post-earnings on profitability worries. Intrator told CNBC that Coreweave has willingly chosen to invest in more infrastructure and take a margin hit to meet the \"once in a generation moment\" for capacity demand.\"I understand the concerns that people have as they see us allocating a massive scale of money to this market, but the truth of the matter is, our backlog is enormous,\" he said.Coreweave's stock plummeted 18% on disappointing revenue guidance. The New Jersey-based company also said it plans to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion in 2026. That surpassed a FactSet estimate of $26.9 billion and fueled profitability worries. Concerns have mounted recently over the long-term sustainability of Coreweave's debt load and business model. The company relies on debt to finance purchases of advanced AI Nvidia chips, which it then rents out. Most of its revenue also hinges heavily on a small group of hyperscalers and AI companies, including Microsoft and OpenAI.Read more CNBC tech newsTrump administration blacklists Anthropic as AI firm refuses Pentagon demandsHow Amazon's massive stake in OpenAI could boost its AI and cloud businessesBlock laying off more than 4,000 employees, nearly half of its workforceNintendo bets more than ever on franchises like Mario to drive Switch 2 salesWhen asked whether troubles in the credit market could lead to higher costs of capital, Intrator said he expects costs to continue to decline.  \"That narrative is out there, but the data does not support it in any way, shape, or form,\" he said. \"Our cost of capital over the last 12 months has come down 300 basis points.\"Calculated across the company's debt load, Intrator said those 300 basis points equate to $700 million in savings and that costs have come down 600 basis points over the last two years. Wall Street analysts are bracing for a volatile road ahead for CoreWeave as its massive infrastructure ramp pressures margins and drives up costs. Analysts at Barclays expect shares to pause near these levels as investors gauge the spending changes. \"If we end up with heightened economic volatility, CRWV shares would probably suffer disproportionately due to risk-off positioning,\" wrote analysts at JPMorgan.

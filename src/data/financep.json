    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, Oct. 28, 2025.Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro is easier said than done. Chevron holds the advantage as the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, according to Wall Street analysts. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry and seized their assets in 2007. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a long and expensive road lies ahead for U.S. oil majors to restore Venezuela to its peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day reached in the 1990s.\"It's a high-risk area for oil companies to invest in,\" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at Global Risk Management.It would require roughly $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years to just maintain crude oil production level of 1.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, according to estimates from consulting firm Rystad Energy. The capital expenditures needed to reach 3 million bpd by 2040 would more than triple, to $183 billion, according to Rystad.Certainty and stabilityU.S. oil majors will want certainty about who is charge in Caracas and how stable the government is, said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy. They will need to know whether the legal and fiscal regime will last long term because energy investments are 30-year projects, said David Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's special envoy for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011.The situation in Caracas right now is anything but certain. Trump declared Saturday that the U.S. will run Venezuela after Maduro's overthrow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to backtrack, telling NBC News in a Sunday interview that the U.S. will use its leverage to pressure Caracas to meet U.S. demands. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has assumed power in Venezuela, pledging over the weekend that the government would defend the country's resources, but later said Caracas sought to cooperate with the U.S. A major question is whether Venezuela could return to a regime similar to Maduro's in the future and nationalize oil assets again, said Global Risk Management's Rasmussen.Surplus reserves U.S. oil majors will grapple with whether it makes financial sense to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela when there is already so much oil in the world, said McNally, a former White House energy advisor under President George W. Bush. \"There are plenty of reasons to think this is going to be more of a long and winding road, rather than a quick shot,\" McNally said.Chevron maintains joint ventures with state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela through a special licensed issued by the U.S. government. Those partnerships are responsible for about 23% of Venezuela's output, according to JPMorgan. \"The company would be in an advantaged position to potentially scale future output as they have significant oil resources in place through their JVs and have been a key developer of the country's energy infrastructure,\" JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients in a Monday note. Chevron shares climbed more than 5% Monday. — CNBC's Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. \"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

Hyunjoo Jin | ReutersLucid Group significantly increased its production and sales last year as it continues to ramp up production of its new Gravity SUV.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer on Monday said its deliveries last year increased to 15,841 units, up 55% compared with 2024, including a more than 70% year-over-year increase during the fourth quarter.The automaker also achieved a previously lowered production target of roughly 18,000 vehicles in 2025, down from an initial expectation of as much as 20,000 vehicles. It produced 18,378 units last year, including 8,412 EVs during the fourth quarter.Much of that increase is likely due to a prolonged ramp-up of its Gravity SUV, which has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages, the company has said. In addition to Lucid's own challenges, EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs because of tariffs and slower forecast sales of EVs, as well as regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.watch now",

    "body": "Home prices are expected to rise by about 2.2% nationally in 2026, but some large U.S. cities — mostly in the Midwest and Northeast — could see prices climb much faster.That's according to a recent Realtor.com forecast, which projects \"a more balanced\" housing market as higher inventory slows overall price growth. Even so, the moderation isn't expected to be evenly felt.\"The Midwest and Northeast have maintained strong demand despite the broader slowdown, largely due to persistent inventory scarcity,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It.While many markets in the South and West are seeing price growth flatten or turn negative as new construction adds supply, cities in the Midwest and Northeast have added fewer homes in recent years, which has helped kept prices moving higher, according to Realtor.com.Here are the 11 large U.S. cities expected to see the biggest home-price increases in 2026:1. Toledo, OhioExpected 2026 price growth: 13.1%Median home price: $199,9002. Syracuse, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 12.4%Median home price: $298,9503. Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, PennsylvaniaExpected 2026 price growth: 10.9%Median home price: $260,0004. Rochester, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 10.3%Median home price: $256,9005. Hartford–West Hartford–East Hartford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 9.5%Median home price: $429,0006. Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, MarylandExpected 2026 price growth: 8.3%Median home price: $375,0007. New Haven–Milford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $439,0008. Winston-Salem, North CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $342,8999. Albany–Schenectady–Troy, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 7.5%Median home price: $419,90010. Columbia, South CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.2%Median home price: $303,30011. Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WisconsinExpected 2026 price growth: 7%Median home price: $379,000Realtor.com's metro-level forecasts are based on its own listings data, along with local inventory levels, new construction activity, employment and income trends, and mortgage rate expectations.What those projections show is that in markets where very little housing has been added, even modest demand is enough to keep prices rising — especially in smaller Midwest and Northeast cities. By contrast, in markets where construction has been heavier, home prices in some areas are expected to fall by as much as 10% in 2026.The metros with the highest expected gains \"have seen very limited new housing development, keeping supply tight,\" says Jones. At the same time, most of these cities have home prices \"well below national averages,\" she says.Overall, only three of the 11 cities on the list have median listing prices above the U.S. median of about $415,000 as of late 2025.Toledo stands out in particular for its relative affordability. The city's median home price of about $199,900 is well below Ohio's statewide median of roughly $275,000, per Realtor's data.Another factor is proximity to larger urban hubs. \"In the Northeast, demand has remained elevated as buyers seek more affordable, commutable alternatives to large, high-cost metros, such as New York and Boston,\" says Jones. \"Because new construction has lagged in many of these older, built-out Northeastern markets, supply constraints remain acute, amplifying the price impact of even modest demand growth.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Nov. 24, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability \"opens new possibilities\" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.\"This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,\" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. ",

    "body": "Mayor of San Jose, Matt Mahan, speaks during the NWSL Championship Welcome Reception at Rotunda at San Jose City Hall in San Jose, California, on Nov. 20, 2025.Eakin Howard | Nwsl | Getty ImagesThe Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth.Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of X posts on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents. \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote. San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego. Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly contentious for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger. \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla wrote on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\"David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as President Donald Trump's crypto and artificial intelligence czar, said on X last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Larry Page, have considered leaving, The New York Times reported.David O. Sacks, chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, speaks to President Donald Trump next to Sriram Krishnan, senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as Trump signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | Reuters\"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\"Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\"The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget. Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot.A report from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to state data.A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid.Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.

They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination,\" the statement read.Most of the more than 9,000 properties affiliated with Hilton and its brands are operated by franchisees.Everpeak Hospitality, the company that operates the Hilton-branded hotel in question, also released a statement.\"Everpeak Hospitality has moved swiftly to address this matter as it was inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all,\" the statement said. \"We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted.  We are committed to welcoming all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.\"CNBC has reached out to DHS for comment.In September 2020, during the first Trump administration, Hilton issued a statement saying that it opposed the use of its hotels for the purpose of detaining migrants, including minors. That statement came two months after Hilton said it had confirmed reports that an independently owned and operated Hampton Inn & Suites in McAllen, Texas, had accepted reservations from a private contractor working on behalf of U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement to house migrants, including minors.\"This is not activity that we support or in any way want associated with our hotels,\" Hilton said in July 2020. \"Our policy has always been that hotels should not be used as  detention centers or for detaining individuals. We expect all Hilton properties to reject business that would use a hotel in this way.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a tweet on Dec. 29, said, \"Homeland Security Investigations @ICEGov are on the ground in Minneapolis right now conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud. More coming.\"A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month said that about $9 billion or more that has been paid through more than a dozen Medicaid programs in the state since 2018 may have been fraudulently obtained.CBS News reported Monday that \"The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota.\"\"The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations,\" CBS reported.— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this article.",

    "body": "watch nowMinneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said Monday that he thinks the central bank is close to the point where it should stop lowering interest rates.In a CNBC interview, the central banker said the key calculus now is whether the Fed should be more focused on a slowing labor market or stubbornly high inflation.\"My guess is we're pretty close to neutral right now,\" Kashkari said in a live CNBC \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We just need to get more data to see which is the bigger force. Is it inflation or is it the labor market? And then we can move from a neutral stance, whatever direction is necessary.\"Calibrating neutral is critical for Fed policymakers as a divided group decides whether to continue the streak of three consecutive rate cuts implemented in the latter part of 2025 or hold pat as policymakers watch economic conditions unfold.The key federal funds rate is currently targeted in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. According to projections made at the December meeting, that's only about half a percentage point from the committee consensus on the neutral rate, or one that neither supports nor restrains growth.\"I think inflation is still too high. And the big question in my mind is, how tight is monetary policy?\" Kashkari said. \"Over the last couple of years, we kept thinking the economy is going to slow down, and the economy has proven to be far more resilient than I had expected. That tells me, well, monetary policy must not be putting that much downward pressure on the economy.\"Kashkari's voice carries a little extra weight in 2026 as he is a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets benchmark interest rates. Recently, he has said he would have opposed recent cuts as he worries about inflation, which could be influenced yet by President Donald Trump's tariffs.Even though he said he is concerned about the labor market, he indicated that the committee's work is close to being done on cutting. The unemployment rate has drifted higher to 4.6% this year while the Fed's preferred core inflation measure most recently was at 2.8%, albeit according to data whose accuracy has been questioned due to impacts from the government shutdown.\"Inflation risk is one of persistence, that these tariff effects take multiple years to work their way all the way through the system, whereas I do think there's a risk that the unemployment rate could pop from here,\" Kashkari said. On a separate matter, Kashkari said he would be happy if Jerome Powell stays on board after his term as chair ends in May. Though he is certain to be replaced as chair, his term as governor lasts until January 2028.\"I have no idea whether he stays on. I think he's done a wonderful job as chair. None of us are perfect. I think he's not perfect. I'm not perfect. As a committee, we're not perfect,\" Kashkari said. \"But overall, I think he's done an excellent job, and I would love to see him remain as a colleague for as long as he likes.\"Trump has indicated he will name a successor to Powell sometime in January.watch nowCorrection: The Fed implemented three consecutive rate cuts in the latter part of 2025.

While allies of President Donald Trump cheered the ouster of the Venezuelan leader, critics worried about the example it set, particularly as China takes an increasingly aggressive posture.\"If Donald Trump can walk into a country and take it over … then why is Putin wrong about Ukraine, and why is China not entitled to take over Taiwan?\" David Roche of Quantum Strategy told CNBC.Other experts are unconvinced. In an appearance on CNBC on Monday, Carlos Gutierrez, a former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President George W. Bush, characterized China's relationship with Venezuela as a \"tactical convenience,\" and one unlikely to catalyze military action in East Asia.\"I don't believe that China will use this as an excuse or justification to attack Taiwan. It's just not the way they think,\" Gutierrez said.\"China will make statements, very aggressive statements. That's expected. They have to do that, but i don't see any tangible significant action on China's behalf,\" he continued.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, left, and China's President Xi Jinping wave during a meeting in Miraflores Presidential Palace, in Caracas, Venezuela, July 20, 2014.Leo Ramirez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.S. has asserted what it calls a \"Trump Corollary\" in its recently released National Security Strategy, reviving the Monroe Doctrine of the 1820s, where the U.S. had a sphere of influence over the Western Hemisphere.A sphere of influence refers to a region where a powerful country seeks to dominate political, military or economic decisions without formally annexing territory.The concept echoes the Roosevelt Corollary, which historically justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.A statement from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,\" calling the developments in Venezuela a \"dangerous precedent.\"Roche warned the action could create unintended consequences: \"On one hand, you've created a series of threats, and on the other, you've created a series of permissions to every dictatorial, autocratic regime, who wants to act to take over territory which is not currently within its ambit.\"The Taiwan questionEven before Trump's attack on Venezuela, questions swirled around whether China was feeling emboldened to increase pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing has long considered part of its territory.China staged live-fire drills around Taiwan in December, framing them as a warning against foreign interference. In his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared unification with Taiwan \"unstoppable,\" echoing U.S. intelligence assessments that Beijing could attempt to seize the island by force within this decade.Ryan Hass, a former U.S. diplomat and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against drawing direct parallels. \"There will be an impulse among foreign policy analysts to draw analogies to Taiwan and to warn about Trump setting a precedent Beijing could use against Taiwan. I would caution against that impulse,\" he  wrote on X.Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), Chinese President Xi Jinping (R), Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (L) and other leaders lay flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2015 in Moscow, Russia.Sasha Mordovets | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHass said China has avoided direct military action against Taiwan, not out of deference for international law or norms, but has instead relied on a strategy of coercion short of violence.\"Beijing will be more focused on protecting its interests, condemning US actions, and sharpening the contrast with the US in the international system than it will be on drawing inspiration from today's events to alter its approach on Taiwan,\" Hass wrote. China's foreign ministry, in a statement after the strike, said it was \"deeply shocked by and strongly condemns the U.S.'s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president.\"Beijing called the strike a \"hegemonic act\" and called on Washington to \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security.\"\"The Trump administration, more so than any American administration in recent memory, is comfortable with great powers like China and Russia having a sphere of influence,\" said Marko Papic, chief strategist of macro-geopolitical at BCA Research. However, it does not mean that Washington is okay with these countries expanding their orbits, he added.Moreover, there does not seem to be an \"abandonment\" of Taiwan by the Trump administration, Papic told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" pointing to the $11 billion arms sale that was announced by Taiwan in December. The U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to providing weapons necessary for Taiwan's self-defense.Rules for thee, not for meEvan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued the U.S. would likely pursue its own sphere of influence while denying one to China.\"The United States is NOT going to 'consent' to a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia,\" Feigenbaum wrote on X. \"Instead, I suspect it will attempt to insist on an American sphere of influence in its own Hemisphere while trying to deny one to China in Asia.\"\"Let's not pretend the U.S. is consistent and that contradiction and hypocrisy in U.S. foreign policy aren't a thing,\" he added in a separate post.BCA Research's Papic said that time was on China's side, and added it did not have to immediately act on Taiwan, while the U.S. is likely to focus on its \"Western Hemisphere.\"\"Why risk getting the entire Western world to unite against [China] by effectively trying to militarily reunify with Taiwan in January of 2026? Why risk it when time is likely on China's side over the next 10 years, as the U.S. continues to focus on the near abroad, and less so on the entire world.\"— CNBC's Chery Kang, Martin Soong and Amitoj Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Yuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty ImagesE-commerce logistics startup Stord has bought CEVA Logistics subsidiary Shipwire, the company said Monday. The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms. \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\"The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added. Stord will look to partner with CEVA's 120 million square foot network across 170 countries.This is the seventh acquisition from the Atlanta-based startup that's challenging e-commerce giants such as Amazon by building out a network of infrastructure to help lower shipping costs and speed up deliveries for smaller merchants. Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr, Cart.com and Shipmonk. Demand for these services has only continued to grow as more consumers shop online, and as merchants increasingly operate storefronts on multiple platforms. Amazon has sought to capitalize on the trend by offering a competing service that lets businesses tap into its network to ship orders placed on other sites, called multi-channel fulfillment.Read more CNBC tech newsChina's BYD overtakes Tesla as world's top EV seller for the first timeChips, robots and fortune telling collide in China's 'Silicon Valley' AI boomDust to data centers: The year AI tech giants, and billions in debt, began remaking the American landscapeGoogle wraps up best year on Wall Street since 2009, beating megacap peers as AI story strengthensStord has been on an expansion spree.In May, Stord bought third-party delivery company and UPS subsidiary Ware2Go for an undisclosed amount earlier this year. The company previously acquired Pitney Bowes' e-commerce fulfillment business and freight and logistics platform ProPack in 2024. Stord recently announced a major investment plan in Kentucky and tech platform Penny Black. Henry told CNBC that the company is looking to make more acquisitions like Shipwire over the coming months and is eyeing expansions into Australia and Asia. Stord's current network includes facilities in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and the Netherlands. Last year, Stord raised $200 million at $1.5 billion valuation. Major investors include Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Salesforce Ventures and Strike Capital.Stord was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old Henry, who dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, which was founded by Peter Thiel. The two-year program currently pays aspiring entrepreneurs $200,000 to quit college to build their startups, according to its website. Famous fellows have included design software firm Figma's Dylan Field, Anthropic's Chris Olah and ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.watch nowCNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 23, 2015 in New York.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry's quiet bet on Venezuelan oil is coming back into focus.The investor best known for \"The Big Short\" said he has owned Valero Energy since 2020, a position he views as increasingly attractive as the U.S. moves toward a deeper role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry.\"Realize that many Gulf Coast refineries were purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude,\" Burry wrote in a Monday blog post on Substack. \"So they have been running with suboptimal feedstock for years. This will, in time, produce better margins across jet fuel, asphalt, and diesel ... I have owned Valero since 2020, and I am more resolved to holding it even longer after this weekend.\"His comments came after President Donald Trump called on U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The country's oil is among the heaviest and most sulfur-laden in the world, and only a limited number of refineries are equipped to process it efficiently.Valero stands out because of its ability to process heavy crude, but Burry said smaller refiners such as PBF Energy and HF Sinclair could also benefit, even if Venezuelan oil arrives only gradually. Any meaningful recovery in exports is likely to take years.Multiple analysts on Wall Street are also highlighting Valero as the biggest beneficiary, should Venezuelan supply increase. Shares of the refiner jumped about 10% Monday. The opportunity may extend beyond refining. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has deteriorated after decades of underinvestment, creating potential demand for U.S. oilfield services companies if large-scale rehabilitation begins, Burry said.Burry said he owns Halliburton, and sees possible upside as well for Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which could be tapped to help rebuild pipelines and refineries.\"Venezuelan pipelines and refineries are old and in disrepair. This work will go to U.S. contractors,\" he said. \"Chevron is already there. Exxon and others have been litigating claims for decades and may see some justice relatively soon, if the US literally begins to run Venezuela as some have suggested. I own Halliburton, and may buy more shares or LEAPs.\"LEAPs, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are options with lengthy expiration dates that could go beyond one year.",

    "body": "Nvidia is building out an automotive tech business. Pictured here are its autonomous vehicle test cars at the company's auto garage in Santa Clara, California, June 5, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia on Monday unveiled plans to test a robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, highlighting the chipmaker's ambition to become a major player in the world of self-driving cars. The service would be offered with a partner, and would employ cars with \"Level 4\" driving, meaning they will be capable of driving without human intervention in pre-defined regions, Nvidia officials said at a self-driving demonstration in San Francisco last month. The company declined to name where it would operate and who its partner will be. \"We will probably start with a limited availability but work with the partner for us to get our footing,\" Xinzhou Wu, Nvidia's vice president of automotive, said at the event. Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the brand name Drive, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber in October.The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco.Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most important growth category after artificial intelligence.\"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\"In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology. Nvidia says that car makers can use its Drive AGX Thor automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles. \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform.Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car. Robotaxis have caught on in the past year, led by Alphabet's Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco. Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy.watch nowRiding an Nvidia robotaxiIn December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride. The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation. But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear. Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times. The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start. \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday. The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said. The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year.Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path. The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do. Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to. \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said. ",

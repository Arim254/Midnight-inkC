    "body": "If you're hoping to save money on medical costs next year, open enrollment is an important time to do it.When you select coverage for the upcoming year, you may be given the option to contribute to a flexible spending account or a health savings account. Both accounts allow you to divert money from each paycheck into an account you can use to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. And contributions to both are exempt from income tax.If you're not familiar with how these work, you're not alone. Only about 19% of Gen Z and millennial workers say they use such accounts and understand the benefits, according to a recent survey from human resources platform Justworks and the Harris Poll.  \"Up to 81% are leaving free money on the table,\" says David Feinberg, senior vice president of risk and insurance at Justworks.Here's how these accounts work, and how much money experts say you should consider putting in them.How much to contribute to your FSAIf you opt for a traditional, co-pay health insurance plan, your company may also offer an FSA to help you cover out-of-pocket costs. Like money you put in a traditional 401(k), contributions to an FSA are subtracted from your taxable income.Money in these accounts must be used for medical expenses such as co-pays, medications or out-of-pocket payments for treatments. And because you're paying with money you owe no tax on, you essentially get a discount equal to your income tax burden. For 2026, you can contribute up to $3,400 to an FSA.Here's the catch. In a given year, you typically have until Dec. 31 to spend all of the money in your FSA. Some companies offer a grace period through March 15 to spend the previous year's funds, and some allow you to roll over a certain amount to the following year — but the overall gist is, use it or lose it.That can make choosing an amount to contribute tricky. Choose too little, and you miss out on discounts for medical expenses. Choose too much, and you could find yourself scrambling at year-end to spend the money before it disappears.\"The best place to start is to look at your regular health-care expenses that you know you do, like if you go to the dentist twice a year, if you get glasses, if you know you go to your doctor or have prescriptions,\" says Carolyn McClanahan, a medical doctor, certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners.Once you add that up, you can consider it a \"baseline\" for what you should have in your FSA, she says.From there, \"maybe add a small buffer for unexpected costs like urgent care,\" says Feinberg. Even if you contribute a little bit too much, FSA funds can be used to cover a wide variety of medical expenses, including everything from bandages to over-the-counter medicines to prescription sunglasses.But if it's your first time contributing to an FSA, don't overdo it, Feinberg says. \"The goal is to save on taxes, not to end the year panic-buying first aid kits just to use up your balance.\"How much to contribute to an HSAYou may decide to enroll in a high-deductible health plan, with a deductible of at least $1,700 for self-only coverage or $3,400 for family coverage. Instead of an FSA, these plans often come with access to a health savings account, or HSA.These accounts offer what money experts often call a triple tax advantage. As with an FSA, money you contribute to an HSA is exempt from income tax. Should you choose to invest money within the account, it grows tax-free. And as long as you put your withdrawals toward qualified medical expenses, you won't owe taxes when you take the money out either.And unlike an FSA, the account associated with an HSA belongs to you. If you move companies or enroll in different insurance, you take it with you. And there's no \"use it or lose it\" provision.For 2026, you can contribute up to $4,400 to an HSA if you have single coverage and up to $8,750 if you have family coverage. When it comes to how much to contribute, the decision is simple, says McClanahan.\"If you're on a high deductible plan with an HSA, then you should max out your HSA every year, irrespective of your health-care costs or your deductible,\" she says. \"One, you get a great tax savings, and two, you get to use that tax-free for any health-care expense the rest of your life. So you want to build that account up.\"That can be easier said than done. Workers often choose high-deductible plans because they offer the lowest premiums and therefore the smallest impact on monthly budgets. They may not have a lot of extra money to put away from each check.But contributing as much as you can to an HSA is worth it, financial pros say. Because you can invest the money in the likes of stocks and bonds, HSAs can be a major retirement asset, even more powerful than a 401(k), provided that you keep growing the account over the years.\"If you start early, you're compounding savings for future medical costs that will come later in life, including those of your current or future dependents,\" Feinberg says.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "watch nowBlue Owl has decided to call off the merging of two of its private-credit funds after the deal caused some angst among investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm had planned to merge its smaller, non-traded Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (OBDC II), into the larger, publicly traded fund Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC). In doing so, the firm restricted investors in the $1.7 billion OBDC II from redeeming until the deal closed, even as the merger would have meant about 20% paper losses, based on where the $17.1 billion OBDC has been trading. News of the restricted redemptions caused shares of the parent company – Blue Owl Capital to slump about 6% on Monday. It also added to concerns about the state of the private credit industry among investors, especially the area that has started to heavily finance the AI datacenter buildout that many fear is overhyped. Blue Owl shares rebounded slightly on Tuesday.The boards of the two firms did not see the benefits of merging the funds as outweighing the volatility and negative headlines that came from news of the deal, according to the people. Therefore, they chose to reverse course, sources said.Blue Owl confirmed in a press release later Wednesday morning that the proposed merger had been terminated, citing \"current market conditions.\"\"Both funds remain strong, with excellent fundamentals, and we are confident in our ability to deliver attractive returns independently as we continue to work with the Board to consider the best future opportunities for OBDC II,\" said Craig Packer, the CEO of both funds, in the release.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlue Owl, 1 monthNow that the fund merger has been terminated, OBDC II will allow investors to redeem in the first quarter, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing non-public information. The fund historically has allowed liquidity on a quarterly basis. Blue Owl shares were little changed in trading Wednesday.",

    "body": "The T.J. Maxx logo is displayed at a T.J. Maxx store on August 20, 2025 in Pasadena, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe CEO of TJX Companies said on Wednesday the holiday shopping season is off to a \"strong start\" as the discounter behind TJ Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls issued fiscal third-quarter results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. \"The availability of merchandise continues to be outstanding, and we are excited about the deals we are seeing in the marketplace,\" CEO Ernie Herrman said in a news release. He said the company's brands are \"strongly positioned as gifting destinations for value-conscious shoppers this holiday season.\" Still, the retailer's holiday guidance fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Assuming current tariff levels stay in effect, the company is expecting comparable sales to rise between 2% and 3% in its current quarter, shy of expectations of 3.1% growth, according to StreetAccount. TJX is expecting earnings per share to be between $1.33 and $1.36, which is also just below expectations of $1.37, according to LSEG. Shares rose more than 2% in premarket trading. Here's how TJX performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.28 vs. $1.22 expectedRevenue: $15.12 billion vs. $14.85 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 was $1.44 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with $1.30 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $15.12 billion, up 7% from $14.06 billion a year earlier.During the third quarter, comparable sales rose 5%, far ahead of expectations of 3.7% growth, according to StreetAccount. TJX raised its guidance after the better-than-expected third-quarter results. While guidance for its current quarter was weaker than Wall Street anticipated, its full-year outlook came in stronger. For fiscal 2026, TJX is now expecting comparable sales to rise 4%, better than the 3.4% growth analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.63 and $4.66, better than the $4.61 analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. The off-price retailer has been growing faster than expected in recent years thanks to value-hunting consumers who are still willing to shop for new clothes, but looking for an impressive discount. While uncertain economic times are a challenge for most companies, they tend to help off-price retailers because of a trade down effect from wealthier shoppers. Even higher tariffs have been seen as a positive for TJX because if they force price increases elsewhere, it's more reason to shop at an off-price store, the company said previously. ",

    "body": "In an aerial view, a customer enters a Lowe's store on May 21, 2025 in Cotati, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesLowe's on Wednesday posted a year over year sales increase for the quarter, but the company lowered its full-year profit outlook slightly to reflect a tougher economic backdrop.The home improvement retailer now expects full-year total sales to be $86 billion, up from its previous expectations of $84.5 to $85.5 billion, because of a recent acquisition. However, it said it expects comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out one-time factors, to be flat compared to a year ago compared with the prior range it had shared of flat to up 1%.For the full year, it now expects adjusted earnings per share of approximately $12.25, on the lower side of its previous range of $12.20 to $12.45. On the company's earnings call Wednesday, CEO Marvin Ellison said the U.S. homeowner \"remains healthy.\" But, he said, \"affordability and uncertainty in the broader economy continue to weigh on consumer confidence, particularly when it comes to larger discretionary purchases, as borrowing costs have been elevated for longer than originally anticipated.\"The company revised its outlook to reflect that economic uncertainty and the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, which closed last month.Here's what the retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.06 adjusted vs. $2.97 expectedRevenue: $20.81 billion vs. $20.82 billion expectedShares rose more than 3% in early trading on Wednesday after Lowe's said its current quarter was off to a good start.Ellison said in the news release that the retailer posted positive comparable sales in the third quarter and also started the current quarter with positive comparable sales, \"despite headwinds related to hurricane activity in the prior year.\"Lowe's comparable sales rose 0.4% in the fiscal third quarter. Home improvement trends, however, remain challenged by a slower housing market and higher borrowing costs — dynamics that have challenged the sector for more than two years.In the three-month period ended Oct. 31, Lowe's net income fell to $1.62 billion, or $2.88 per share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $2.99 in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $20.17 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one time items, including pre-tax expenses associated with its acquisitions, Lowe's reported earnings of $3.06 per share.Rival Home Depot on Tuesday also lowered its full-year profit forecast after missing Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations for the third quarter in a row. Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail attributed weaker earnings to lower-than-usual storm activity, a tough housing market and consumer uncertainty.While the home improvement industry faces a tougher backdrop, Lowe's CFO Brandon Sink said there are trends that the company feels \"cautiously optimistic about as we look ahead to 2026.\" For instance, he said, the retailer has had stronger sales on the pro side of the business and in appliances. And, he said, there are \"early signs of life\" in its home services business.Ten of the company's 14 merchandise divisions, including appliances, flooring, kitchen and bath, posted positive sales growth in the quarter, Bill Boltz, executive vice president of merchandising, said on the company's earnings call. Some of those categories, such as kitchen and bath, are typically associated with bigger projects and remodels.Like Home Depot, Lowe's has tried to attract more business from contractors and other home professionals to offset weaker do-it-yourself sales. In August, Lowe's announced it had struck a deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, insulation and other interior building products for large residential and commercial professionals, for about $8.8 billion.Earlier this year, Lowe's announced another pro-focused acquisition. It said in April it had agreed to buy Artisan Design Group, which provides design services and installation of flooring, cabinets and countertops for homebuilders and property managers, for nearly $1.33 billion.On the company's earnings call in August, Sink said he expected the company's own strategy, not an improving industry backdrop, to drive sales for the year. He said the retailer expects \"a roughly flat home improvement market\" for the year.",

    "body": "2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepLOS ANGELES — Jeep's new Recon all-electric SUV will start at $65,000, the American SUV brand announced Tuesday when it officially revealed the vehicle.The 2026 Jeep Recon has been years in the making, as the idea of an electric vehicle inspired by the brand's iconic off-road Wrangler SUV was first revealed in 2021. It is expected to begin production early next year at a plant in Mexico.The Recon, revealed Tuesday ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show, includes familiar, boxy Jeep styling as well as removable doors, a spare tire on the rear and open-air roof — all synonymous with the brand's Wrangler SUV.\"With the Jeep Recon, we're proving that electrification isn't just compatible with off-road excellence, it can elevate it, delivering instant torque, precision control and a quieter, more connected driving experience that's uniquely Jeep,\" Bob Broderdorf, CEO of Jeep, said in a release.2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepThe Recon is part of Jeep's ongoing turnaround plan, which comes after years of sales declines and after several Jeep SUVs were canceled for the U.S. in an attempt to boost profits.The EV is the last of four new or updated products Jeep promised to reveal in four months. The first three were a new Jeep Cherokee hybrid and redesigned versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer.\"We're wrapping up the 4x4 – four cars in four months. Recon is the last car to do that. That will complete the storyline,\" Broderdorf said during a media call about the brand's plans to launch a slew of special-edition vehicles next year.The Recon's electric motors combine to produce 650 horsepower and 620 foot-pounds of torque — similar to some V-6 and V-8 sports cars. But that power comes at a cost, with the vehicle getting up to 250 miles of range on a charge, which is lower than many current, less expensive EVs.Read moreThe Recon's price is a roughly $14,000 premium over an entry-level 2025 Wrangler plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and a nearly $27,000 premium over a base 2026 Wrangler four-door. Pricing is in line with the $65,200 Wagoneer S EV, with a range of 294 miles.The Recon comes as Jeep's Stellantis parent company is heavily reducing its investments in EVs following changing market conditions and CEO shake-up in the past year. In the broader market, sales of EVs have plummeted following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle.Broderdorf said the end of federal incentives is expected to impact sales across the industry, including with the Recon, but the new SUV functions as an EV \"bookend\" alongside the sportier Wagoneer S for the Jeep brand's electric portfolio.\"I'm not going to just chase volume just to chase volume,\" he said during the media call. \"I want to sell cars in the right way. Everybody who wants a [battery-electric vehicle], Recon, I want to make sure that we're there for them. After that, it doesn't really matter to me.\"The Recon is being produced at Stellantis' Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico alongside the Wagoneer S, Jeep Compass and the new Jeep Cherokee, which is being offered exclusively as a hybrid vehicle.2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepBroderdorf, who started leading the brand in February, said the plant can easily adjust to produce the higher-volume Compass and Cherokee depending on demand for EVs. Both gas-powered vehicles also are expected to be manufactured in the U.S. in the coming years for additional flexibility.\"\"We're going to grow, grow and grow,\" Broderdorf previously told CNBC. \"That's the mission. And do it in a healthy way.\"Jeep's been dealing with a spiraling sales decline that started after the brand reached an all-time high of more than 973,000 SUVs sold in 2018. The brand's sales have fallen 40% since then to less than 590,000 units last year in the U.S.Jeep's sales through the third quarter of this year were up less than 0.5% compared with a year earlier. Jeep's U.S. market share has fallen from 5.4% in 2019 to 3.7% since 2024, according to Cox Automotive.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump, during a meeting with Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince, not pictured, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025. Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked as he angrily lashed out at a reporter from the network who asked why he has not released files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend.\"I think you are a terrible reporter,\" Trump told ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce.The president said he did not like Bruce's \"attitude.\"\"You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.Trump's tirade came shortly before the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all of its records on Epstein.The DOJ earlier this year refused to release those documents, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.Trump does not need to wait for Congress to pass a bill. He could order the DOJ to release more Epstein files.\"Why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files?\" Bruce asked the president. \"Why not just do it now?\"Trump said, \"As far as the Epstein files ... I have nothing to do with\" him.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docs\"I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert,\" Trump said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.\"People are wise to your hoax,\" the president told the reporter. \"Your crappy company is one of the perpetrators.\"\"And I'll tell you something,\" Trump said. \"I think the license should be taken away from ABC. Because your news is so fake and so wrong.\"\"We have a great commissioner ... who should look at that,\" he added, apparently referring to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose agency oversees broadcast licenses.In September, Carr threatened ABC's license over comments by late-night show Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" said Carr on a podcast at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"Hours after Carr's remarks, ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"The show returned to air about a week later after backlash against ABC and its parent company, Disney.Trump has repeatedly called the Epstein matter a \"hoax\" created by Democrats, even though members of Trump's Make America Great Again movement were leading advocates for releasing the files.And Trump failed to dissuade Republican allies in Congress from supporting the bill to release the files.On Sunday night, as the Epstein bill's chances of passage appeared to rise, Trump suddenly reversed course and urged his GOP allies to support the measure.On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.Trump and Epstein had been longtime friends but had a falling out years before Epstein killed himself in jail in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Last week, the House Oversight Committee released emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email from 2019, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of his nation, on Tuesday brushed off questions about bin Salman's involvement in the 2018 killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\"Things happen,\" Trump said when asked about Khashoggi's killing by Mary Bruce of ABC News, as he sat next to bin Salman in the Oval Office. Khashoggi, who was a critic of the regime, was also a U.S. resident.Trump called the ABC News reporter \"fake news\" after she asked about Khashoggi, about claims by families of 9/11 victims that Saudi Arabia bankrolled the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and about the propriety of Trump's business investing in Saudi Arabia.\"You're mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,\" Trump said of Khashoggi.\"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about, whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen,\" Trump said.Referring to bin Salman, Trump said, \"But he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.\"\"You don't have to embarrass our guests by asking a question,\" Trump said.U.S. President Donald Trump (R) speaks during a bilateral meeting with Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia (L) in the Oval Office of the White House on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.

But, you know, we have to focus on reality.\"\"Reality based in CIA documents, and based on a lot of documents that Osama bin Laden used Saudi people in that event, for one main purpose, is to destroy this [relationship], to destroy the American-Saudi relation,\" bin Salman said.\"It's really painful to hear .... anyone that been losing his life for you know, no real purpose or ... not in a legal way,\" bin Salman said, referring to Khashoggi.\"And it's been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\" the prince said. \"We did all the right steps of investigation ... in Saudi Arabia, and we've improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this still doesn't happen.\"Khashoggi's widow, in a social media post directed at Trump before the meeting with bin Salman, wrote, \"The murder of my husband has caused me to lose everything. There is unfinished business that remains including: the recovery of my husband's body & my rightful compensation as his widow.\"\"Much like the families in Israel, I would like to recover the remains of my husband so that I may have an appropriate religious burial ceremony,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi wrote in the post on X. \"And much like the 9-11 families, I am seeking financial compensation for the murder of my husband.\"Hanan Khashoggi separately told CNN in an interview that \"it is very painful for me\" to see Trump welcome bin Salman to the White House.The prince's visit is his first to the United States since Khashoggi was killed.",

In a separate letter to parliament, Karremans said it had become clear Beijing now appeared to be permitting companies from European and other countries to export Nexperia chips, adding that \"this is an important step.\"The development appears to bring an end to a bitter dispute between the Netherlands and China, one that had prompted global automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage. The Dutch economic affairs ministry said the country considered it to be \"the right moment to take a constructive step\" by suspending the order under the so-called Goods Availability Act. It added that it would continue to hold talks with Chinese authorities over the coming weeks.CNBC has reached out to Nexperia, which is based in the Netherlands but owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, and the Chinese embassy in the U.K. for comment. The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of the company. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that technology from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday welcomed the Dutch government's decision to suspend its intervention at Nexperia, saying the move will help to stabilize strategic supply chains. \"Continued constructive engagement with partners remains essential to securing reliable global flows. I stay in close contact with all my counterparts,\" Sefcovic said in a post on X.Shares of Europe's auto giants were trading mixed on Wednesday morning. Milan-listed Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, RAM, Dodge and Chrysler, was last seen up 0.1%.Germany's Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW, meanwhile, were all trading slightly lower at 11:12 a.m. London time (6:12 a.m. ET). — CNBC's Michael Wayland contributed to this report.",

But the Trump administration may be trying to use a workaround by contracting with other agencies to perform the department's tasks.\"They are attempting to hollow out the U.S. Department of Education, leaving behind a shell of the original organization,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off nearly half of the Education Department's staffers.\"We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs,\" Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today.The government shutdown \"underlined just how little the Department of Education will be missed,\" McMahon said.Tuesday's announcement did not include information on the future of the government's student loan portfolio. However, administration officials are exploring options to sell some of the debt to the private market, Politico reported in October.Former President Jimmy Carter established the current-day Education Department in 1979. Since then, the department has faced other existential threats, with former President Ronald Reagan calling for its end and Trump, during his first term, attempting to merge it with the Labor Department.",

    "body": "watch nowWalmart is in talks to buy a startup called R&A Data, a company founded by two Israeli scientists that works to reduce scams and counterfeits on online marketplaces, according to people familiar with the matter and records reviewed by CNBC. The potential acquisition would come at a key time for the largest U.S. retailer as incoming CEO John Furner prepares to take the helm early next year. Walmart's third-party marketplace has become a central part of the company's strategy to increase profits faster than sales, and has helped it expand its e-commerce business, which grew 25% in the U.S. in its most recently reported quarter. The company has said it added hundreds of millions of product listings to the platform in recent years, growth that experts say increases the need for tools to detect issues with items.R&A Data has been working with Walmart as a third-party vendor since at least 2024, helping the company screen listings on its online marketplace for compliance issues, such as counterfeiting, according to the people and records. After working with the tech startup, Walmart decided to acquire it, CNBC learned.Additional details about the possible deal weren't immediately clear. Walmart, which is due to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday, didn't return multiple requests for comment from CNBC. R&A Data declined to comment.The news comes two months after CNBC published an investigation into Walmart's online marketplace that found the company made its seller and product vetting controls more lax over time as it looked to grow the platform and take market share from Amazon. Third-party online sales have become a critical growth engine for Walmart, as the retailer moves to offer a wider variety of items to a larger base of shoppers.During its investigation, CNBC found at least 43 third-party sellers that had used the identity of another business to set up their account. CNBC authenticated 20 beauty products and supplements offered by the sellers who had used the identity of a different business, and all of those products were determined to be counterfeit, according to brands that make the products or outside lab testing.After CNBC shared the results of its investigation, Walmart said \"trust and safety are non-negotiable for us.\" \"Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior,\" Walmart said at the time. \"We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers.\"How retailers prevent fakes — and where R&A fitsTo combat counterfeits and other scams, marketplaces generally need a two-pronged approach, experts previously told CNBC. They said platforms need to have firm onboarding and vetting protocols to ensure bad actors aren't joining to begin with, and ongoing monitoring of listings to prevent the sale of dangerous, fake or illegal products. A Walmart acquisition of R&A could help it monitor the hundreds of millions of product listings it hosts on its platform to ensure they're compliant with its rules, according to the people familiar with the matter.Founded in 2022 by entrepreneurs Noam Rabinovich and Raz Abramov, both former members of the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, R&A Data uses artificial intelligence to monitor listings for compliance, according to the people, the founders' LinkedIn profiles, interviews they've given in the past and R&A's website. There's little public information about R&A Data but its website, which was taken down some time in the last two months, described the company as \"your partner in portfolio safety.\" \"Scan millions of listings and products at lightning speeds, with incredible accuracy; our AI-powered platform delivers reliable, dependable protection, at scale,\" the website said, according to an archive of the page captured on Sept. 5. People interested in the software could submit their contact details for further information, but the website said registration for early access was \"full\" and it was \"not accepting any further sign-ups.\" \"If you would like to be considered for 2025 access please submit your details,\" the website said. Rabinovich and Abramov previously founded another company, EverC, which helps online platforms and other firms detect and remove risky merchants, money laundering schemes, fake, illegal and dangerous products, and other compliance challenges, according to its LinkedIn page. Rabinovich left the company in October 2022, while Abramov departed in February 2023, according to their LinkedIn pages.— Additional reporting by CNBC's Paige Tortorelli.",

    "body": "The Target bullseye logo is seen on the outside of its store at the Lycoming Crossing Shopping Center. Paul Weaver | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTarget posted a drop in quarterly sales and lowered its full-year profit guidance on Wednesday as the big-box retailer saw choppy spending and shoppers hunting for value.Despite its ongoing struggles, Target stuck by its sales guidance for the all-important holiday season, saying it expects sales to decline by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. It said it anticipates adjusted earnings per share for the year to come in between $7 and $8, lowering the high end of its previous range of $7 to $9. Much of its new range would be lower than last year, when adjusted earnings per share were $8.86.On a call with reporters, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke declined to say when he thinks the company's sales would turn positive again, but said Target is making progress.\"We are focused every day on making the right investments and the right decisions to get Target back to growth as quickly as possible,\" he said. Fiddelke, who is Target's chief operating officer and former chief financial officer, will step into the CEO role on Feb. 1. The company announced in August that he would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.He said Target will step up investment next year to try to turn around its stores and boost sales by increasing capital expenditures to $5 billion, a 25% year-over-year jump.Here's what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.78 adjusted vs. $1.72 expectedRevenue: $25.27 billion vs. $25.32 billion expectedTarget's sales have been roughly stagnant for four years as it faces stiffer competition and has grown weaker in some of the areas that set it apart in the past, including its eye-catching merchandise, its well-organized stores, and its friendly and helpful customer service. Some customers also boycotted the retailer after it rolled back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a dynamic that Target blamed in part in May for its weaker sales results.Shares of the company have tumbled, too. As of Tuesday's close, Target's stock has fallen about 67% since the company's all-time high in late 2021 and dropped about 35% so far this year. The stock was down more than 3% in premarket trading Wednesday.Fiddelke laid out three priorities on the day he was named Target's next CEO: strengthening Target's reputation as a retailer with stylish, well-designed merchandise, providing a more consistent shopping experience online and in stores, and using technology to move the business forward.At the time, he said he wouldn't wait to start making changes.Last month, Target announced it would cut 1,800 corporate jobs — its largest layoff in a decade. It has taken steps to sharpen its merchandise and get back its fashion sense, including sending its designers to rodeos and ski lodges for inspiration. And it's tweaked its online fulfillment strategy at stores to try to free up employees' time to stock shelves and assist customers.On a call with reporters about the fiscal third-quarter results, Fiddelke pointed to a few other moves the company has made. He highlighted Target Trend Brain, a generative artificial intelligence-powered tool that helps the company's designers and merchants identify what colors and styles are popular. It also is using synthetic audiences, AI models that simulate how real customers might respond to products or marketing campaigns, before launch.Target on Wednesday announced another way it's trying to rev up the business and adapt to new ways that people are shopping. It said in a news release that it is launching an experience with OpenAI, which allows customers to shop Target's app within ChatGPT. It will launch next week in beta and allow users to purchase multiple items in a single transaction, shop for groceries and choose the way they want to get those purchases, such a curbside pickup.Over time, Target shoppers will also be able to request personalized recommendations, the company said in the release. Read moreYet Target's challenges in winning over shoppers persisted in the most recent quarter. Customers made fewer trips across Target's stores and website and spent less during those visits. Traffic dropped by 2.2% and average transaction amount fell by 0.5% year over year.Comparable sales, an industry metric that excludes one-time factors like store openings and closings, decreased 2.7%. Digital sales increased 2.4%, driven by more than 35% growth of same-day deliveries.It marked the third consecutive quarter of declining comparable sales, which are also called same-store sales.Target's fiscal third-quarter net income dropped about 19% to $689 million, or $1.51 per share, from $854 million, or $1.85 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue fell from $25.67 billion in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time costs such as severance packages, Target's adjusted earnings per share were $1.78.Fiddelke told reporters that Target saw \"some volatility\" in the quarter. Sales in both August and October were about flat as customers shopped for back-to-school and Halloween, but September sales fell about 4% year over year.Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said consumer behavior didn't change from the previous quarter, with shoppers \"stretching budgets and prioritizing value through spending where it matters most, especially in food, essentials and beauty.\" Gomez and Fiddelke acknowledged other challenges specific to the third quarter, such as the pause of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during the government shutdown. To capture the attention and dollars of lower-income shoppers, Target last week cut prices on 3,000 food and household products. Target has also set the price of some key holiday items so they feel like bargains, such as ornaments starting at $1, candles starting at $5 and throw blankets starting at $10, Gomez said.Target is also trying to stand out with more products that customers can't find elsewhere. It has 20,000 new items in its holiday assortment, more than double the year-ago holiday season, with over half of those only available at Target, Gomez said. In a bid to bring in customers beyond merchandise, it teamed up with Starbucks for an exclusive drink that shoppers can't find elsewhere, a Frozen Peppermint Hot Chocolate Frappuccino.Target tends to see stronger sales during holidays and seasonal changes. Yet Gomez said even during those moments this year, customers have been selective. At Halloween, for example, Gomez said shoppers made \"trade offs,\" as the company saw stronger candy sales and weaker decor sales. Gomez said he expects that pattern to hold during the holiday season. \"We think the consumer will prioritize what goes under the tree versus what goes on the tree,\" he said.Correction: Target's fiscal third-quarter net income dropped about 19% to $689 million. An earlier version misstated the figure. ",

    "body": "A Tesla Inc. robotaxi on Oltorf Street in Austin, Texas, on June 22, 2025.Tim Goessman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla has obtained a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in Arizona, the state's department of transportation said. The electric vehicle company applied for a \"transportation network company\" permit on Nov. 13, and was approved on Monday, ADOT said in an emailed statement. Additional permits will be required before Tesla can operate a robotaxi service in Arizona.In July, Tesla applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations in Phoenix, with and without human safety drivers on board. A month earlier, Tesla started a robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, with safety valets and remote operators. Tesla also operates a more traditional car service in the San Francisco Bay Area.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla plans to take human safety drivers out of its cars in Austin before the end of this year. The company is aiming to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix and several other U.S. cities before the end of 2026.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, Tesla cars equipped with automated driving systems were involved in seven reported collisions following the launch of the company's pilot in Texas. Competitors including Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China are way ahead in the nascent robotaxi ride-hailing market. In the Phoenix area, Waymo operates a sizable commercial business, with at least 400 autonomous vehicles, the company previously told CNBC. In May, Waymo said it had surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across the U.S.Baidu said in an earnings update on Tuesday that its Apollo Go service \"provided 3.1 million fully driverless operational rides in the third quarter of 2025,\" representing year-over-year growth of 212%.Musk has been promising that Tesla will \"solve\" autonomy for years without reaching its goals. The world's richest person has continued with the lofty pronouncements. At the company's 2025 shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said the \"killer app\" for self-driving technology is when people can \"text and drive,\" or \"sleep and drive.\" \"Before we allow the car to be driven without paying attention, we need to make sure it's very safe,\" Musk said. \"We're on the cusp of that. I know I've said that a few times. We really are at this point.\" WATCH: Baidu to ramp up global exports as robotaxi service grows in Chinawatch now",

    "body": "The cooling towers of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Oct. 30, 2024.Danielle DeVries | CNBCThe Trump administration will provide Constellation Energy with a $1 billion loan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, Department of Energy officials said Tuesday.Previously known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, the plant is expected to start generating power again in 2027. Constellation unveiled plans to rename and restart the reactor in Sept. 2024 through a power purchase agreement with Microsoft to support the tech company's data center demand in the region.Three Mile Island Unit 1 ceased operations in 2019, one of a dozen reactors that closed in recent years as nuclear struggled to compete against cheap natural gas. It sits on the same site as Three Mile Island Unit 2, the reactor that partially melted down in 1979 in the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history.The loan would cover the majority to the project's estimated cost of $1.6 billion. The first advance to Constellation is expected in the first quarter of 2026, said Greg Beard, senior advisor to the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, in a call with reporters. The loan comes with a guarantee from Constellation that it will protect taxpayer money, Beard said.Constellation's stock was up more than 2% in after hours trading on Tuesday. The control panel in the main control room of the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant is seen on Oct. 30, 2024 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, U.S.Danielle DeVries | CNBCCEO Joe Dominguez hinted at federal financial support previously, telling investors in Sept. 2024 that Constellation would \"take a look as we finance the project at loan guarantees and other things that will be available.\" Constellation is the largest operator of nuclear plants in the U.S.When asked why Constellation was receiving the loan now, Beard said Tuesday that Constellation could have completed the project without help from the Energy Department. But the loan will help make electricity cheaper for consumers on the grid operated by PJM Interconnection, which serves more than 65 million people across 13 states, Beard said.\"What's important for the administration is to show support for affordable, reliable, secure energy in the U.S.,\" Beard told reporters. \"This loan to Constellation will lower the cost of capital and make power cheaper for those PJM ratepayers.\"Electricity pricesEnergy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that his department's loan office would use most of its money to support the nuclear industry. President Donald Trump signed four executive orders in May that aim to significantly expand new nuclear capacity.Consumers in many states in the PJM region are facing significant electricity price increases as the rapid increase in demand from artificial intelligence data centers outstrips available supply.\"We want to bring as much net addition of dispatchable, reliable electricity onto the grid to stop these price rises in electricity,\" Wright told reporters on Tuesday.The turbine deck of the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant is seen  on Oct. 30, 2024 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, U.S.Danielle DeVries | CNBCThe Crane Clean Energy Center is one of three shuttered nuclear plants in the U.S. that are aiming to start generating power again this decade subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Crane had the capacity to power more than 800,000 homes when it closed in 2019, according to Constellation.The Energy Department is supporting the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan with a $1.5 billion loan to Holtec International. NextEra Energy announced in October plans to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa through an agreement Alphabet's Google Unit.When asked whether NextEra will receive a loan for Duane Arnold, Beard told CNBC that Trump's executive orders direct the Energy Department to \"prioritize the restart of nuclear reactors.\"",

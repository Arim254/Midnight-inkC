    "body": "Billionaire serial entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban has some job-hunting advice for his two children — and anyone else who finds themselves looking for entry-level roles — in the age of artificial intelligence.The advice is simple: Prioritize working for a smaller company over fighting for a job at a large corporation.At a big business, your AI skills are probably somewhat extraneous, says Cuban: You might know how to use AI effectively, but so does everyone in the company's large, established IT department.\"Small- to medium-size companies don't have that depth,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It. \"They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don't have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results.\"Cuban referenced his own company Cost Plus Drugs as an example, in a podcast episode of \"The Dumbest Guy In the Room\" that published on Sept. 30. \"People that understand AI and agentics, [who] can go and look at our processes and automate them using AI ... [can] help us become more productive, competitive and profitable,\" he said.Podcast host John Dick's company CivicScience was similarly situated, Cuban noted.\"[Small companies] have to compete differently, and they don't have the resources to just have a huge IT department,\" said Cuban. \"Just like we saw with the early days of the internet, you hired young kids who were more comfortable with it, who learned it already and could come in and implement new things.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterNinety-five percent of companies haven't yet seen measurable revenue return from their AI investments, according to a July report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. The few companies in the minority are largely early-stage tech startups run by young entrepreneurs, who build their companies' processes around AI models specifically tailored to their businesses, the MIT report said.\"I tell [my children], like I tell every young kid, there's going to be two types of companies in this in this country: There's going to be those who are great at AI and those who used to be in business ... And if you're looking for a job, it's going to be easier to work for a small company than a large company,\" Cuban said on the podcast.Cuban, 67, has three children, including two daughters currently attending college at Vanderbilt University and UCLA. He's advised them to \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,\" he told the \"TBPN\" podcast in an Aug. 20 episode. \"Companies don't understand how to implement all that right now to get a competitive advantage,\" he added.Some other experts also say young people seeking entry-level jobs in the age of AI should emphasize their soft skills — like communication, emotional intelligence and critical thinking — to potential employers. Being curious, adaptable and embracing new opportunities to learn \"is a skill in and of itself,\" Kiersten Barnet, executive director of the nonprofit New York Jobs CEO Council, said at the CNBC Workforce Executive Council Summit on Oct. 7.Ben Goodwin, the CEO and co-founder of beverage company Olipop, attributes most of his success with his $1.85 billion-dollar company to his human skills, not his technical capabilities, he told CNBC Make It in September.\"Things that have been really important for me have been believing in myself, emotional regulation, things like storytelling, [and] getting as good as possible at leading people as quickly as possible,\" he said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "When in a heated basketball game or rushing against the clock to meet a deadline at work, sometimes delivering constructive criticism needs to be quick.Taking the time to present feedback in an appeasing way like using the \"sandwich approach\" to share criticism in between two compliments is simply not feasible when you're in a crunch, says Sonia Raman, head coach of the WNBA's Seattle Storm.In a basketball game, \"you might have a couple seconds when the ball goes out of bounds to talk to a player before we inbound and go to the next play,\" Raman says. \"There's not going to be a lot of time. You have to be really direct, and you have to go for it.\"However, delivering candid criticism in a heated moment can be risky. To avoid hurt feelings, Raman says she relies on the relationships and trust she builds with players throughout the year.Sonia Raman, former assistant coach with the Memphis Grizzlies, reviews film with player Gregory Jackson on Feb. 4, 2024 in Boston, Massachusetts.Paul Rutherford | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesWhether through one-on-one meetings, side conversations during practice, or taking players out to lunch or dinner, Raman says she builds trust in various ways. Each relationship is unique, but the most important part is having genuine interactions.\"As I make those connections and [my players] start to understand that I care, and that I care not just about the wins and the losses, but about them as people, then the rest of the conversations flow,\" Raman says.How to build genuine trust in the workplaceShifting how you approach small talk can be a simple yet powerful way to build trust and genuine rapport in the workplace, leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio said in May.Instead of defaulting to conversations about the weather, take the opportunity to ask questions that show a sincere interest in the other person like \"I know things are a little hectic this week. How are you holding up?\" Or, \"I heard your son graduated this week. Congratulations! How did you celebrate?\" Mercurio said.When talking about work, building trust comes down to being honest, authentic and candid, even if you've made mistakes, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year. No one is going to trust you if you're an agreeable employee or only focus on the positives as a boss, he said.\"If you want to earn trust: If you say you've got something, deliver it. If you own something and it's not going well, be self-critical, and fix it,\" Jassy said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom.In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that \"hyperscalers\" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic.\"Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings - one of the more common frauds of the modern era,\" Burry wrote. \"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of SoftBank Group plunged as much as 10% Wednesday after the Japanese giant said it had sold its entire stake in U.S. chip giant Nvidia for $5.83 billion. The capital will be used to fund SoftBank's $22.5 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.Shares of SoftBank Group last traded more than 6% lower.In its earnings report, SoftBank said it sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. It also trimmed its T-Mobile position, raising $9.17 billion.\"We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength,\" said SoftBank's chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, during an investor presentation.While the decision to unload Nvidia shares may have caught some investors off guard, it isn't SoftBank's first exit from the U.S. chip heavyweight.The company's Vision Fund was an early Nvidia supporter, reportedly building a $4 billion stake in 2017 before fully divesting in January 2019. Despite the latest sale, SoftBank remains closely tied to Nvidia through its broader business interests.\"This is a bullish signal on the theme from SoftBank doubling down and not a bearish sign in our view,\" said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities.While OpenAI is central to SoftBank's GenAI portfolio, hardware remains a priority as well, mostly through its stake in British chip designer Arm, with which SoftBank is co-developing products, said Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research. SoftBank has a controlling stake in U.K-based Arm Holdings, whose chip designs power mobile and AI processors.Several other tech stocks in the region also declined.

(Photo by Huang Jingwen/Xinhua via Getty Images)Huang Jingwen | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images  Even as a U.S.–China trade truce appears to be holding, analysts caution that the détente remains fragile in a rivalry increasingly defined by strategic competition.A flurry of decisions, outlined in the sweeping trade deal struck by U.S. President Donald Trump with Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month, took effect on Monday, with rollbacks of steep tariffs and export controls.The U.S. halved fentanyl-linked tariffs on imports from China to 10% and extended for a year a truce that lowered the reciprocal tariff rate from 34% to 10%.In return, China's Ministry of Commerce rolled back several export restrictions on critical minerals and rare earth materials to the U.S. on Monday. Those curbs, first imposed on Oct. 9, had targeted materials vital for military hardware, semiconductors, and other high-tech industries.Beijing also reversed retaliatory limits on exports of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other so-called super-hard materials such as synthetic diamonds and boron nitrides. Those measures, introduced in December 2024, were widely seen as a response to Washington's expanded semiconductor export restrictions on China. Still, Morgan Stanley economists said that Beijing has not unwound the export-control framework it introduced in April – likely to maintain a \"calibrated choke-point\" meant to preserve leverage.Given the persisting strategic rivalry, \"we view rolling negotiations, episodic flare-ups, and policy asymmetry as the new equilibrium,\" the economists said.China is also reportedly developing a so-called \"validated end-user\" system, or VEU, to block rare earth exports to companies with ties to the U.S. military, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.The system, if strictly implemented, could make it more difficult for automotive and aerospace companies with both civilian and defense clients to import certain Chinese materials, the Journal reported.Trade thawBeijing on Monday added 13 fentanyl precursors to its export control list, requiring a license for shipments to the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.The Ministry of Commerce also suspended sanctions against five U.S.-linked subsidiaries of South Korea's shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean for a year, while the Ministry of Transport paused measures targeting the U.S. shipping sector, including port fees. The U.S. Trade Representative said Sunday it would suspend its own measures for one year.watch nowAs part of the bilateral agreement, the White House said China agreed to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of this year and 25 million annually over the next three years. Beijing, which has not confirmed those numbers, appeared to have resumed soybean purchases from the U.S. recently, according to Reuters, after shunning them for most parts of this year.\"These steps suggest 'so far, so good,' but in reality, this is just the beginning,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. While there were incentives for both sides to keep the truce in place, such \"de-escalatory moves tend to be short-lived,\" she added.China's economy, weighed down by the prolonged trade war with Washington, grew 4.8% in the third quarter — its slowest in a year and down from 5.2% in the second quarter.In a notice Monday, China's State Council announced 13 measures to promote private investment in several major state-dominated industries.China's push for self-reliance amid \"fierce international competition\" at last month's top economic plenum was a sign that the leadership is linking growth goals more closely to strategic competition with the U.S., said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society.\"Beijing is not chasing a grand bargain [but] seeking a truce to buy time and build leverage,\" Thomas added. He added that while Washington and Beijing both prioritize self-reliance over interdependence, Xi is betting that his strategic resolve will outlast Trump's.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Lisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAMD CEO Lisa Su said on Tuesday that the company's overall revenue growth would expand to about 35% per year over the next three to five years, driven by \"insatiable\" demand for artificial intelligence chips.Su said that much of that would be captured by the company's AI data center business, which it expects to grow at about 80% per year over the same time period, on track to hit tens of billions of dollars of sales by 2027.\"This is what we see as our potential given the customer traction, both with the announced customers, as well as customers that are currently working very closely with us,\" Su told analysts.Ultimately, Su said that AMD could be able to achieve \"double-digit\" share in the data center AI chip market over the next three to five years.AMD shares fell 3% in extended trading. Shares rose in extended trading when AMD said its gross margins in coming years would be between a range of 55% to 58%, better than analysts had expected. The AI chip market is currently dominated by Nvidia, which has over 90% of the market share, according to some estimates, and which has given the company a market cap of over $4.6 trillion, versus AMD's roughly $387 billion valuation.AMD is holding its first financial analyst day since 2022, as the company has found itself at the center of a boom in data center spending for AI.While companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars in total on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips to build and power artificial intelligence applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, they are also looking for alternatives to increase capacity and control costs. AMD is the only other major developer of GPUs aside from Nvidia.In October, AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI in which it would sell the AI startup billions of dollars in its Instinct AI chips over multiple years, starting with enough chips in 2026 to use 1 gigawatt of power.As part of the deal, OpenAI could end up taking a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Su also highlighted long-term deals with Oracle and Meta on Tuesday.AMD shares have nearly doubled so far in 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

AMD reported $5 billion in AI chip sales in its fiscal 2024.That's up from the company's previous forecast of a $500 billion market in 2028 for AI chips. But the updated AMD figure also includes central processors (CPU), an important kind of chip that sits at the heart of a computer, but isn't a pure AI accelerator like the GPUs made by Nvidia and AMD.AMD's Epyc CPUs are still the company's most important product by sales. It primarily competes with Intel and some smaller Arm-based processors in the CPU market. AMD also makes chips for game consoles, networking parts, and other devices.On Tuesday, although AMD focused much of its focus on its growing AI business, it told shareholders that its older businesses were growing too.\"The other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders, and that's actually a very nice place to be,\" Su said.watch now",

    "body": "Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks at a press conference with other Senate Democrats who voted to restore government funding, in Washington, DC on November 9, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUpdate: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.Senate Democrats are poised to help Republicans pass a bill that could lead to the end of the government shutdown. But the deal they're agreeing to doesn't directly address what was once Democrats' key demand: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to expire by year's end.The Senate took a major step toward ending the shutdown on Sunday night, when eight Democrats in the narrowly divided chamber voted for a procedural motion that paves the way for approval of a negotiated funding bill.Those eight Democrats, who broke with party leadership, were just enough for the measure to hit the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. That rule has prevented Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, from reopening the government on their own.The procedural vote's passage broke a nearly six-week logjam in which most Senate Democrats repeatedly shot down a Republican-backed bill that would temporarily resume government funding at current levels.What Democrats wantedDemocrats had demanded that any funding bill must include significant additional spending on health care protections and other key measures.Most notably, they fought for a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits under the ACA, which were introduced during the Biden administration and are set to expire by year's end. If those subsidies lapse, millions of Americans could either lose their health insurance or see their premiums rise significantly.Democrats also sought to reverse some recent cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. And they aimed to address the Trump administration's freezing of congressionally approved federal funds, which Democrats say is illegal.Update: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.What's in the funding dealThe text of the funding deal that helped spur Sunday's breakthrough leaves many of those priorities unaddressed. The 31-page bill makes no mention of the expiring Obamacare tax credits.U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looks on outside the Senate Chamber after the vote on the 40th day of the partial government shutdown, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 9, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersInstead, the agreement includes a guarantee from Republican leadership that the Senate will vote on a health care bill drafted by Democrats before the second week of December.\"That is a big step, because otherwise there's no way for the minority to get a bill onto the floor of the U.S. Senate,\" Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Sunday night after helping to broker the deal.Even if a bill to extend the tax credits passes the Senate, it would have to be taken up and passed through the GOP-led House, and then signed by President Donald Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not promised to bring such a bill to a vote in his chamber.The deal currently moving through the Senate also reportedly does not challenge Trump's ability to make rescissions of congressionally appropriated funds.But it does include a \"minibus\" that funds three of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and it would resume funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 30.That full-year funding would cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, sources familiar with the deal told NBC News. The Trump administration has said that full SNAP benefits cannot be paid during the shutdown, prompting ongoing lawsuits from Democratic state leaders.The deal would also reverse the Trump administration's shutdown-related \"reductions in force\" or layoffs of federal workers, and ensure backpay for the paychecks they missed during the shutdown.Deal divides DemocratsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" he said Sunday.U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a press conference to discuss how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting healthcare, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDistrustful Democrats had previously rejected Republicans' insistence that any negotiations on the Obamacare subsidies could only come once the government was reopened.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also panned the Senate deal, and vowed to fight it if it comes to his chamber.But King, who negotiated the Sunday compromise along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, maintained that it was futile to keep the painful shutdown going in hopes of getting Republicans to bend on health care.\"The question was, 'Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?' Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen,\" he told the press Sunday night.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe major shift came just days after Democratic candidates trounced Republicans up and down the ballot in the first elections since Trump returned to the White House.Additionally, numerous polls have show more Americans pinning their blame for the shutdown on Trump and Republicans, rather than Democrats. Surveys have also shown most Americans supported Democrats' initial main demand of extending the health care subsidies.But the stalemate dragged on, taking an increasingly severe toll on major industries and key federal services as many government workers remain furloughed or required to work without pay.Thinned-out staffing among air traffic controllers has caused mounting flight delays and cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country.The political fallout from the Senate Democrats' shutdown shift remains to be seen. Critics were quick to accuse the Democratic defectors of folding despite holding an arguably strong position on the shutdown. But defenders of the move say it could benefit Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections.\"With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table — or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way,\" Shaheen said in a statement.\"If they don't fix this, here's my prediction. They're going to look at last Tuesday's election as a good night compared to what they're going to see next year,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Monday morning.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Senate on Monday night passed a bill to fund the federal government through January and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.The bill, which passed 60-40 with support from a handful of Democratic senators and nearly all Republicans, will be sent to the House of Representatives.If it passes the House, the legislation will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.Trump earlier Monday said he supports the funding deal, which was negotiated between Republicans and a gang of moderate Senate Democrats nearly six weeks after the shutdown began on Oct. 1.House Speaker Mike Johnson told his Republican conference earlier Monday that he wanted GOP House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., for a vote on the bill.US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said Monday on CNN.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesUntil Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

Brian Snyder | ReutersFlight disruptions that have marred air travel for millions of people in recent weeks could continue even after the government shutdown ends, airlines and the secretary of Transportation said.The Senate on Monday night passed a bill that could end the longest federal government shutdown in history, sending it to the House for a vote.But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday that won't be an immediate fix.\"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel but it depends on controllers coming back to work,\" Duffy said at a press conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Duffy also warned severe disruptions over the past few days could get much worse without a deal.The Senate vote came as staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without their regular paychecks in the shutdown, have delayed or canceled thousands of flights, with issues worsening in recent days. Controllers missed their second full paychecks of the shutdown this week, and some have taken up second jobs and are working with increasing levels of stress, government and union officials have said.Even if the House passes the bill that will fund the federal government through January, airlines said they will need time to readjust.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivals\"Airlines' reduced flight schedules cannot immediately bounce back to full capacity right after the government reopens,\" Airlines for America, a lobbying group for airlines including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said late Monday. \"It will take time, and there will be residual effects for days. With the Thanksgiving travel period beginning next week and the busy shipping season around the corner, the time to act is now to help mitigate any further impacts to Americans.\"Airlines will need time to reconfigure schedules and position planes and crews, something they were forced to quickly address with last week's required flight cuts.More than 5 million travelers have been affected by airline staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Airlines for America said . The disruptions have sent some passengers looking for alternatives, from buses to rental cars and even private jets.Last Friday, the Trump administration started requiring commercial airlines to cut 4% of their domestic flights at 40 busy U.S. airports, with larger reductions on the way if the shutdown doesn't end, as officials blamed the strain on air traffic controllers.watch nowAviation groups have said that record numbers of travelers are expected for the Thanksgiving period, with the holiday just over two weeks away.Just over 5% of the scheduled 22,811 U.S. departures were canceled on Tuesday, a relatively light day for travel generally, according to aviation data firm Cirium. That's down from an 8.7% cancellation rate on Monday, or 2,239 flights, and 2,633 cancellations on Sunday, or 10.2% of the schedule. Delays had also piled up with staffing shortages and bad weather at major hubs, including Chicago O'Hare.The shutdown, like the one in late 2018 to early 2019, has thrust aviation's strains into the spotlight. The previous shutdown, however, ended hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers snarled air traffic in the New York area.Aviation groups on Tuesday urged lawmakers to not only end the shutdown but to provide more Department of Transportation funding to help modernize air traffic control and hire more controllers, who were in short supply even before the shutdown began.\"The government shutdown has disrupted that work and slowed the strong momentum we have built for modernization,\" the Modern Skies Coalition, which includes major airline, airport and aerospace groups such as Boeing, GE Aerospace and others, as well as labor unions, wrote in an open letter to Congress.President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to dock pay of air traffic controllers who are absent. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who weren't absent during the shutdown.Duffy said he supported Trump's idea and that he was concerned about the dedication and \"patriotism\" of controllers who haven't shown up for work. \"If we have controllers who systemically weren't doing their job, we will take action,\" he said.Duffy said controllers would receive about 70% of their pay within two days of the shutdown ending.A day earlier, Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole in the shutdown that ended in 2019.Duffy said the shutdown has made air traffic controller staffing more challenging, with 15 to 20 of them retiring a day instead of around four retiring a day before the government closure. He said the country is roughly 2,000 controllers short of what the system needs.\"The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough every day, but forcing federal employees to do it without pay is unacceptable,\" the Modern Skies Coalition wrote in its open letter. \"We owe public servants at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies supporting aviation, like the National Transportation Safety Board, the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection, a debt of gratitude and a swift ending to this shutdown.\"",

Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story.The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers.But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled.Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with \"ghost jobs\" that never seem to get filled.\"The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,\" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. \"The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy.\"Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even.To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers.The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone.watch nowPotential inventoryMoreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future.Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer \"ghost jobs\" out there.One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards.Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday.However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C.Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the \"quits rate\" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the \"Great Resignation.\"A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures.There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision.\"For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,\" Escalera said. \"Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode.\"",

Jean Carroll $5 million in damages after holding him liable for sexually abusing her during an encounter in a New York department store in the 1990s and for defaming her decades later.Trump's request on Monday comes nearly 11 months after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the verdict issued by a civil jury in Manhattan federal court in May 2023.The petition to the Supreme Court says that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the trial, made a \"series of indefensible evidentiary rulings,\" among them \"improperly admitting highly inflammatory propensity evidence against President Trump.\"That evidence included testimony by two other women who alleged that Trump committed sexual misconduct against them at other times.The petition also says that Kaplan erred by allowing Carroll's lawyer to play for jurors the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their prior consent.There is no automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not known when the high court will decide whether to take Trump's appeal.Writer Jean Carroll and Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump look on as Lawyer John Sauer (not pictured) argues for him, as he is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a $5 million jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of raping her nearly three decades ago, in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 6, 2024, in this court sketch.Jane Rosenberg | ReutersCarroll, in a 2019 New York magazine article, first went public with her allegation that Trump raped her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s.She sued him for allegedly defaming her in comments he made while flatly denying that allegation after the article appeared.Carroll later filed a separate lawsuit accusing Trump of rape and of defaming her again in late 2022 when he commented on her allegations.That second lawsuit was the subject of the trial that ended in May 2023. Jurors in that case did not find Trump liable for rape, but did find him liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her.It is that verdict that Trump has asked the Supreme Court to overturn with the new petition.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks, during the swearing-in ceremony for Sergio Gor as U.S. Ambassador to India, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 10, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\"Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th President, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,\" the petition says.\"Notably, Carroll's allegations are a story that precisely matches the plotline from an episode of one of admittedly her favorite TV shows, 'Law & Order,' \" the petition says.A spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement on the petition, said, \"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes.\"\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, declined to comment on the petition.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe first defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against Trump went to trial after the second lawsuit did.In January 2024, a Manhattan federal court jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll in statements he made as president in 2019 when he denied her claims of rape.That jury ordered him to pay her $83.3 in damages.Trump appealed that verdict.The 2nd Circuit appeals court in September rejected that appeal.\"As observed by the district court, the conduct here supports a significant punitive damages award — it involved malice and deceit, caused severe emotional injury, and continued over at least a five-year period,\" a three-judge panel of the appeals court said in its decision denying Trump's appeal.\"The record in this case supports the district court's determination that the 'the degree of reprehensibility' of Mr. Trump's conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented,' \" the panel said.Trump has filed a petition with the 2nd Circuit asking that the appeal be reheard by a panel comprised of all active judges on the circuit.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building after the U.S. Senate advances a bill to end the government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S.,  November 10, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEconomic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business.The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law.From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics.\"The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. \"While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases.\"Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week.watch nowThe BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. \"But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,\" they said.That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by \"at least a week,\" Goldman said.For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading.When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters.Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture.\"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. \"Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown.Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case.As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.",

Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe U.S. and Switzerland are getting close to signing a trade deal to lower tariffs of 39% that President Donald Trump slapped on the country in August.The president confirmed on Monday that White House officials were \"working on a deal to get the tariffs a little lower.\"\"I haven't set any number, but we're going to be working on something to help Switzerland,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.\"We hit Switzerland very hard. But we want Switzerland to remain successful,\" he added, saying the country had been a \"very good ally.\"The tariff on Swiss exports could be cut to 15%, matching the rate that was imposed on EU exports to the U.S., according to various media reports citing sources close to the talks. Bloomberg reported that a deal could be finalized within weeks.\"We are not commenting on the ongoing discussions,\" a spokesperson at Switzerland's economy ministry told CNBC, adding that Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin \"is in regular contact with the relevant authorities in the U.S., including USTR Jamieson Greer.\"CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment and is awaiting a response.The duty was met with consternation in Switzerland, whose key exports include watches, jewelry, machinery, chocolate, electronics and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Shares of Swiss firms Swatch Group and Richemont traded higher at the market open on Tuesday.High-profile Swiss businesses have been outspoken on the damage the tariff was wreaking, with the CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling telling CNBC that the duty was \"horrible\" for Switzerland.watch nowThe 39% tariff was among the highest duties that Trump levied in his sweep of global tariffs this year, with the president angered by trade imbalances with the Swiss, and multiple other countries.According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland amounted to $38.5 billion last year. The Swiss government said that the trade relationship between the two was \"relatively balanced,\" according to a CNBC translation.\"The U.S. has a surplus of services exports and Switzerland does for goods exports,\" the government said in August, adding that its goods surplus is not rooted in unfair trade practices and that over 99% of U.S. goods can be imported to Switzerland without being subject to tariffs.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesRocket Lab posted record revenues in the third quarter as it scoops up more launch deals and builds its backlog.The space stock slipped more than 1% on Tuesday, pulling back from earlier gains.The company, which makes satellites and rockets and provides launch services to its customers, on Monday reported revenue of $155 million for the period. That surpassed the $152 million forecast from analysts polled by LSEG, and it was up 48% from about $105 million a year ago. Rocket Lab also posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 3 cents per share, versus the 10-cent per share loss anticipated.Additionally, Rocket Lab issued strong guidance for the current quarter, saying it expects revenues between $170 million and $180 million. Analysts had forecast $172 million in revenues.Rocket Lab said it's experiencing a record backlog, with 49 rocket launches on contract. The company said it signed 17 of those deals during the third quarter and plans to close out the year with over 20 launches.In an earnings release, CEO Peter Beck said the Long Beach, California, company is \"just days away\" from reaching a new annual launch record. Rocket Lab is also tackling mergers and acquisitions that target key defense initiatives such as President Donald Trump's missile defense system plan known as the 'Golden Dome,\" Beck added.Competition is intensifying in the space technology sector as the U.S. government and NASA lean on more independent contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, to power missions to return to the moon. Growing excitement has also brought a wave of space companies to the public markets this year, including Texas-based Firefly Aerospace.Last month, Rocket Lab's stock jumped more than 31% after announcing a slew of new launch deals. Shares have more than doubled this year and surged nearly 270% over the last twelve months. The stock has pulled back about 13% in November amid a broader market selloff.During the third quarter, the company closed its acquisition of satellite sensor maker Geost and opened a new launch site for its Neutron rocket.Rocket Lab reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $26.3 million, topping the $21 million to $23 million loss range previously forecast. Analysts anticipated a $22.2 million adjusted EBITDA loss, according to FactSet.The company expects adjusted EBITDA losses to range between $23 million and $29 million in the fourth quarter, surpassing the $13 million loss forecast by FactSet.WATCH: Rocket Lab CEO talks competing for Space Force contractswatch now",

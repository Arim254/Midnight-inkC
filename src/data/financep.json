    "body": "Attendees during the Singapore Airshow in Singapore, on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. The show runs through Feb. 8. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, defense buyers at the Singapore Airshow say they are prioritizing sovereignty, from local production and co‑development to owning the software and intellectual property that run their systems. Industry leaders say that control over hardware, software and supply chains is now a central factor in procurement decisions.Executives at the show, which closes on Sunday, pointed to shifting alliances and tougher rhetoric from major powers as a catalyst for the trend. \"There is a notion that is coming around very explicitly ... the notion of sovereignty,\" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development at French aerospace and defense firm Thales, told CNBC.Sourisse added that this mindset has helped drive defense spending higher as countries conclude they must look after their own security.Chua Jin Kiat, executive vice president and head of international defense business at Singapore engineering and defense firm ST Engineering, echoed the sentiment, and said that over the last 12 months, U.S. President Donald Trump's combative stance toward allies has pushed countries to realize that \"we may not be able to depend on others.\"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has pushed its allies to spend more on defense, with NATO committing to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2035. Trump has threatened allies' such as Canada and most recently Denmark over its territory of Greenland. He has also reportedly said he would sell allies weaker versions of American weapons \"because someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"Chua added that countries are recognizing that old alliances and alignments may not be \"so enforceable or relevant\" anymore, even organizations such as NATO. \"So you can be a NATO member. But actually, at the end of the day today, what we are seeing is, first and foremost, if I'm Germany, I'm Germany. If I'm Finland, I'm Finland,\" he said. Supply chain resilienceA direct consequence of that shift is a renewed emphasis on boosting supply‑chain resilience. Companies told CNBC they are responding by localizing production, transferring know‑how, or partnering with domestic firms so customers can maintain and upgrade systems without long, fragile supply lines.Sourisse said Thales is not only marketing its solutions but also planning to localize activities and competencies. The company has set up joint labs in Singapore with local agencies to develop capabilities on the ground.ST Engineering's Chua said the company, constrained by Singapore's limited land area available for large factories, prefers co‑production arrangements overseas. For example, if ST Engineering can make advanced vehicles in a country with more space for production plants than Singapore, the company would collaborate and teach them how to build them in a co-production effort.\"For many of the big primes, they have to keep their factories at home running. They have got huge production plants, thousands of jobs, and the lights have to be kept on constantly.\"New kids on the blockSovereignty extends beyond factories to software and intellectual property. Newer firms in the defense tech space are becoming aware of those demands and are structuring deals accordingly.U.S.- based Shield AI, which develops autonomous warfare systems, signed a memorandum of understanding at the airshow to integrate its Hivemind autonomy software across selected ST Engineering platforms. Shield AI X-bat flight renderingShield AIThe company had earlier in 2025 partnered with the Republic of Singapore Air Force to use Hivemind to enhance the RSAF's autonomous capabilities.Brandon Tseng, co‑founder of Shield AI, told CNBC that Hivemind enables other companies and militaries to develop their own artificial-intelligence pilots locally, and Singapore would own that intellectual property. \"They can build AI pilots for whatever they want to do. We don't own [the IP],\" he told CNBC. Tseng added that while countries will continue to buy some foreign hardware, many want to indigenize critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy.",

    "body": "Playing for his fifth NFL team in eight years, 28-year-old quarterback Sam Darnold is preparing to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a potential championship title in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday — a moment that's required a high degree of mental resilience to reach, he told The Athletic on Friday.Darnold's career started with high expectations as the No. 3 draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Instead, he lost more games than he won over his first three seasons, got traded and ultimately served as a backup quarterback for multiple teams over multiple years. He won a starting job with the Minnesota Vikings in 2024 after his primary competition for the role suffered a season-ending knee injury, and to many pundits' surprise, led the Vikings to a 14-3 record that season.His performance led to a three-year contract with Seattle worth $100.5 million in March. Now on the precipice of an NFL championship, Darnold says the resilient mindset he first learned from his parents helped him overcome his own mistakes and self-doubt to resurrect his career.\"My dad worked as a plumber, and my mom is a PE teacher, and it never mattered what kind of day they had. They were always consistent for me and my sister,\" Darnold told The Athletic. \"[It] didn't matter what had happened at work; my dad was always out there playing catch with me afterwards. So, you know, I feel like I just naturally kind of learned to be resilient.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsDarnold still relies on his family to help him maintain a balanced mental state today, he said. \"I would say my family is a huge part in just my ability to get over things when it's bad, and they do a good job of keeping me grounded when things are good,\" said Darnold.Resilience is a key ingredient of success, psychologists agree: It helps us move on from mistakes while maintaining enough confidence to keep taking calculated risks. Teaching kids how to recover from failure and learn important lessons they can apply later on should be the goal of every parent who wants to raise mentally tough and resilient children, psychotherapist Amy Morin wrote for CNBC Make It in March 2021.\"The most accomplished people reached their goals by failing along the way,\" Morin wrote. \"Kids who do well later in life focus their attention on what went wrong and how they could fix it. They have growth mindsets that help them turn failures into positive learning experiences.\"A three-sentence mantra for resilienceEarly in his career, Darnold dwelled too much on his mistakes, he told Fox Sports in an interview that aired on Jan. 30. He'd allow his on-field performance to disproportionately affect his mood and overall mental health, he said.Reflecting on his parents' longtime mindset helped inspire the mental shift that Darnold credits with helping turn his career around, he said. \"Sometimes, mistakes happen and you learn from it,\" he said. \"And you don't want to make the same mistakes again, but [if you have] a long career, those things are going to happen.\"Darnold also took inspiration from a quote from Jerry Rice, one of the greatest players in NFL history, he told The San Francisco Standard on Thursday.\"Jerry Rice said that he never had a perfect practice or a perfect game,\" said Darnold. \"That's the mindset I try to have. It's not always going to be perfect, [but] it's about how can you move on from mistakes to continue to better the team and better yourself.\"Now, rather than dwelling on mistakes — which are bound to happen, in some way — Darnold tries \"to flush bad plays, flush bad games\" from his memory and move on with his positive attitude intact, he told The Athletic.When things don't work out the way he'd planned, he turns to a mantra for resilience, he said: \"'That happens. It's football. We're not always going to be perfect.'\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: Appian Corp. (APPN) Business: Appian provides business process management (BPM) solutions. Its products include BPM software, case management, mobile application development and platform-as-a-service. The company was founded by Matthew Calkins, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson and Michael Beckley in 1999 and is headquartered in McLean, Va.Stock Market Value: $1.86B ($25.21 per share)Activist: Fivespan PartnersOwnership: 7.91%Average Cost: $29.73 Activist Commentary: Fivespan Partners, LP is a San Francisco-based investment firm founded in October 2023 by Dylan Haggart and Sarah Coyne. Prior to Fivespan, Haggart and Coyne were partners at ValueAct Capital and 80% of the investment team is from ValueAct. Fivespan, named after the unique five-stone arched bridge in Haggart's hometown, views itself as a bridge between the market and companies. The firm prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism, but it would resort to a proxy fight if there were no other choice. We expect that Fivespan will look for board seats in situations where it believes it could add real value, but we do not expect the firm to pursue board representation as often as ValueAct does (i.e, in roughly 50% of core portfolio positions). Haggart has experience as a public company director. He served as a director of Seagate (2018-present) and Fiserv (2022-2024), where he delivered stellar returns over his tenures of 205.25% and 64.68%, respectively, versus 46.12% and 4.98% for the Russell 2000. Fivespan looks for high quality, idiosyncratic businesses with good, strategic assets. The firm does not advocate for selling its portfolio companies as a primary activist strategy, but it likes companies that people want to own. Accordingly, many of its activist campaigns could end with a sale of the company, providing two paths to shareholder value. The fund is a drawdown structure that holds investments for at least three to five years, aims to have six to eight investments at a time and averages $100 million to $300 million in each investment.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Fivespan announced that it will continue meeting with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board.Behind the scenesAppian provides mission critical business process and management software solutions to some of the largest, most complex enterprises in the world. Its customer base consists primarily of legacy businesses that operate outdated backend technology stacks, including large banks, telecom companies and even the Department of Defense. Appian's software is deeply embedded into these companies' systems, resulting in extremely high switching costs. As a result, customers hardly ever leave, with gross retention at approximately 99%. Moreover, Appian and its peers have penetrated only about 10% of what could be a $90 billion market. As a result, the company benefits from consistent mid-teens revenue growth, mostly from new business with current clients. Despite this compelling backdrop, Appian shares trade at roughly 2-times sales and 3-times gross profit – more than a 50% discount to similarly situated peers.With Appian's stock down 89% over the past five years, Fivespan Partners has entered the picture filing a 13D disclosing a 6.16% position in Appian and announced that it will continue to have meetings with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board. Any changes made or board representation would have to come at the invitation of the current board as Appian is effectively a controlled company. Appian co-founder CEO, chairman, and president Matthew Calkins controls about 39% of the voting power, two of the other three founders are on the nine-person board with many other directors being former employees of Appian or having relationships with Calkins. But that is OK. Going back to his ValueAct days, Dylan Haggart has had a lot of experience and success working with controlled companies like KKR and The New York Times, the latter of which is also a current Fivespan portfolio position.There are at least three solvable issues that have driven Appian's discount. First is that the market has a fundamental misconception around Appian's artificial intelligence risk. As is the problem with many software companies, Appian has been broadly categorized as an \"automation\" company, leading it to be lumped in with businesses genuinely exposed to AI disruption, such as customer service or chatbot-driven automation. Appian's automation, however, is entirely different, as it is focused on creating and implementing complex backend processes. Nevertheless, this branding has forced it to be painted with the same brush, and in today's market, anything associated with automation is being sold off indiscriminately. Anyone who looks at Appian's financials' can recognize the fallacy of this bear case, as the company's growth and retention metrics look nothing like those of companies with actual AI risk. The problem here is that Appian has thus far failed to communicate this to the market. The company's four founders – Matthew Calkins, Michael Beckley, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson – are tech guys, mostly college buddies who started this company out of a garage. These are not guys who want to talk to the market, and the company's lack of an investor relations professional further underscores that. Thus, communicating this narrative to the market and perhaps even finding someone to fill this role for the company are both areas where Fivespan could add immediate value.Second is a lack of focus on margins. Historically, management, like many other growth companies, has prioritized top-line growth with limited attention to the company's profitability, leaving Appian's free cash flow margins in the low single digits, while comparable businesses like Pega generate margins north of 30%. With Fivespan now involved, this is likely to begin to change. Appian's recurring and sticky revenue model should allow them to pursue both revenue growth while expanding margins, by ensuring that incremental growth generates incremental profitability. While margins won't jump overnight, they should improve steadily each quarter as costs continue to grow more slowly than revenue, something we have observed from larger peers like Pega and ServiceNow. It is important to note that this is not a situation where layoffs and cost-cutting will lead to margin improvement, just being conscious of incremental costs as revenue increases should significantly benefit the bottom line.Lastly is capital allocation. As margins expand, Appian should become a cash cow, making disciplined capital allocation increasingly important for a company that hasn't had the strongest track record of doing so. This is where we see Haggart adding the most value. Some of the best activism occurs when a good activist gets on the board of a good company and management continues to do what they do best – run the business generating significant free cash flow, and an activist like Haggart does what he does best – help advise the board the best way to spend the cash flow to maximize shareholder value. This is one thing ValueAct is known for and that Haggart did extremely well at companies like Seagate. And this is an even more important skill to have on Appian's board, as the company is on the verge of coming into an at least $500 million windfall from a corporate espionage lawsuit filed against Pega. Appian sued Pega in 2020 and won a $2.036 billion verdict in 2022. The Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in 2024 and remanded it back to the lower court for a new trial. However, Appian had partly insured the verdict in the amount of $500 million, meaning that if it's ultimately awarded less than $500 million, the insurance company will make up the difference. If it's awarded more than $500 million, it is theirs to keep and the insurance company is off the hook. So, it is just a matter of time before Appian receives at least $500 million, which is more than 25% of the company's entire market cap.In the firm's other three campaigns, Fivespan has demonstrated that it prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism — and that's a good thing as it doesn't have any other choice here. However, while any strategic, operational, or governance changes are ultimately in the company's discretion, we think Appian and Fivespan are rowing in the same direction. Moreover, we think the company would benefit greatly from the addition of a minority shareholder representative on the board, like Haggart or another Fivespan executive. One of the benefits of having a hedge fund representative on the board is that the board not only gets the director's advice and counsel, but the resources of the entire firm and its team of analysts. This is particularly important when there are crucial capital allocation decisions to be made. Ultimately, this will be an activist-lite campaign and Haggart knows that he can only be effective here with the blessing and invitation of the founder. We expect he will proceed with that in mind.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Photographer: Toru Hanai/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has likely strengthened its majority in the country's Lower House, with the LDP capturing between 274 and 328 in the 465 seat chamber, according to an early projection by broadcaster NHK. This was broadly in line with what polls had suggested, with Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun predicting that the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party would secure more then 300 seats in the Lower House. People trudged through heavy snow in several parts of the country to cast their votes.Before parliament was dissolved, the LDP-JIP coalition held a combined 230 seats, and with three independents voting with the LDP, this effectively gave the ruling coalition a one seat majority in the chamber. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved the Lower House on Jan. 23, a move that was seen as an attempt to quickly strengthen the ruling coalition's position in the chamber by capitalizing on her high public approval ratings. Polls compiled by Japanese media outlet Nippon.com showed that Takaichi remains popular heading into the election, although her support has slipped slightly in the recent weeks. The outlet reported that just one domestic poll in January indicated more than 70% support, compared to three in December, while six polls showed support in the 60% range, up from four in the previous month. The election comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and China, as well as persistent concerns over the yen's weakness and inflation in the country.Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness.The most recent inflation reading stood at 2.1%, while full-year inflation reached 3.2%. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022.The yen weakened further at the start of 2026, briefly approaching the 160 level against the U.S. dollar. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation.Takaichi had earlier laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs.-- This is a developing story.

    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares closed on Friday up 17%.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

    "body": "A young woman wearing headphones browses vintage vinyl records in a store.Mihailomilovanovic | E+ | Getty ImagesAccount manager Matt Richards, 23, deleted all his social media apps from his phone last year, and was surprised to find that his life changed for the better. Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison.\"I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world,\" Richards told CNBC Make It. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. Going chronically offline is the latest trend to grip young people, and ironically it's going viral on social media. There's been a surge of TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engage more with in-person and analog hobbies. When I discovered the trend, I decided to post on LinkedIn to see if there were any young people willing to speak to me about going offline. To my surprise, I received nearly 100 responses from Gen Z and millennials sharing stories about social media detoxes and digital burnout. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. A 2025 Deloitte consumer trends survey of more than 4,000 Brits found that nearly a quarter of all consumers had deleted a social media app in the previous 12 months, rising to nearly a third for Gen Zers. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined since time spent on the platforms peaked in 2022, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, the report found. The decline was particularly pronounced among teens and 20-somethings. Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said the increased \"nastiness and divisiveness\" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. \"We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life,\" Dorsey said. 'Pressure platform' Young people who are deleting their social media platforms cite the increasing pressures of being online as well as damage to their mental health as causes.Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social apps reported these apps had negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. \"I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere,\" Richards said, adding that it influenced his own feelings of not having enough stuff or accomplishing enough in his career. We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them...this person doesn't need validation.Matt Richards 23-year-old account manager Similarly, 36-year-old entrepreneur Lucy Stace said she's limiting her social media use because it's \"diminishing\" her mental health despite it being essential to her business. \"We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information,\" she said. \"We're actually diminishing our brain's capacity to be able to look inward and listen to ourselves, and we're value tagging all of these things that aren't actually important to us.\" Tech giants face \"tremendous pressure\" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, said Dorsey, which can be off-putting to younger generations. \"The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to — they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world — now they're getting advertised to even more, and their feeds feel just [like] commercial after commercial,\" Dorsey said. Offline is the new 'cool' As the tide shifts against social media, account manager Richards noted that those who have gone offline have become more interesting. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. \"We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s,\" he said. Social media manager Julianna Salguero, 31, said that social media stopped being cool when politicians and brands started using the platform.\"The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it,\" Salguero said. As the digital generation struggles to make friends and find partners, they're instead seeking out in-person events like speed dating and professional networking, citing high levels of loneliness and isolation as a key driver. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an \"extremely exhausting process\" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. \"There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings,\" Gerrard said. \"It's so much more than a trend.\" GWI analyst Chris Beer said he believes this is a \"legitimate post-pandemic correction,\" since people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. This shift is \"largely due to structural time allocation,\" he said, especially for younger users, rather than \"an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media.\" Social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education, Beer said.Analog is back In a Substack post in September that got 5,000 likes, Salguero expressed a yearning to have lived life in the '90s when dating apps and doom scrolling weren't a prerequisite of young adulthood. Her article, titled \"How to have an analog fall,\" wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media — from going on lunch dates to writing physical letters and opting for tangible media like newspapers. Salguero said going analog is a \"quiet revolution\" against social media, streaming, and content overload. Lacy Stace and her boyfriend's record collection.\"When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them,\" she said. \"So for me, the going analog of it all isn't necessarily throwing my phone into the ocean, it's more about, 'How do I reset my relationship with it?'\"Indeed, young people are increasingly turning towards physical media as they seek a break from digital life. Some are purchasing vinyl and record players, while others are getting flip phones, a relic of the 2000s. Stace and her boyfriend have started building a record collection and visit record stores when they can, she said.Richards, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a \"brick phone\" too, reverting back to the time when phones were primarily used to call people.

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday endorsed Nexstar Media's proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, just months after criticizing the deal.\"We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar - Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level. Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future. GET THAT DEAL DONE!\"Under the agreement, Nexstar, which owns or partners with over 200 stations, would add Tegna's 64 stations — covering roughly 80% of the country. The deal, announced in August 2025, was expected to close in the second half of 2026. Trump's backing of the Nexstar-Tegna deal marks an abrupt turnaround. In a Truth Social post in November, Trump railed against the Nexstar-Tegna deal and the potential for more industry consolidation.\"If this would also allow the Radical Left Networks to 'enlarge,' I would not be happy,\" Trump wrote. \"ABC & NBC, in particular, are a disaster - A VIRTUAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. They should be viewed as an illegal campaign to the Radical Left. NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!\"Nexstar, Tegna and the White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The proposed Nexstar-Tegna deal is part of a string of recent media consolidation efforts as cord-cutting threatens the industry.\"We believe that broadcast news is essential to this country and a free democracy, independent local news, and that broadcast TV is basically the last bastion of local news at the local level, and our goal is to become a bigger company and hopefully be able to compete on a level playing field with Big Tech that is pervasive in all aspects of media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook told CNBC after the deal announcement. watch nowCurrently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits a company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households to foster competition. For Nexstar's deal to go through, the FCC would have to lift that rule.\"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal.In September, Nexstar was the first media company to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late-night talk show's host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

    "body": "The Trump administration's portfolio of equity stakes in U.S. companies has reached a scale that is unprecedented outside economic crisis or wartime. The administration has taken stakes or has agreements to do so with at least 10 companies, most of which are publicly traded. The government announced its latest investment, USA Rare Earth, at the end of January. Democrats have also considered taking stakes in U.S. industries in the past. But the Trump administration's approach carries risks both for the companies involved and for the broader markets in which they operate. \"It is a invisible barrier to startups and new market entrants,\" said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer affiliated with Cato Institute. \"Why would you ever want to enter a market that you know your chief competitor is backed by the U.S. government?\" Many of the investments are in smaller critical mineral companies, like USA Rare Earth and MP Materials, but they also include big industrial and tech companies such as U.S. Steel and Intel. Top administration officials like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have argued that the U.S. government is investing in strategic industries to reduce dependence on Tawain in the case of semiconductors and China for critical minerals. Historically, the U.S. has taken equity stakes in companies in the context of bailouts with the understanding that the investments were temporary and the government would exit its position when the company was financially viable again, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. President Barack Obama, for example, took a stake in General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis and President Franklin Roosevelt took stakes in the banking sector during the Great Depression. But the Trump administration appears to be taking open-ended ownership interest that the U.S. government is unlikely to exit, Lincicome said. It sets a precedent that future Democratic presidents could use to invest directly in their favored industries like wind and solar, he said. \"I have yet to see a clear, coherent reason for why equity stakes are needed,\" Lincicome said. Federal support that falls short of ownership stakes like loans, government contracts and other awards are widely available, he said.  After the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Lutnick told CNBC that President Donald Trump wants the American taxpayer to benefit when the government gives money to corporations.But the administration's approach creates political, legal and business risks for the companies involved, Harrell and Lincicome said. It also raises potential conflict of interest concerns, they said. CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment.Political, legal riskThe Trump administration's approach is a major ideological departure for the Republican Party, which has traditionally championed free market capitalism and excoriated government intervention. The Democrats have typically been the party of industrial policy and intervention in markets.Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, introduced an amendment to Biden's CHIPS Act that would have allowed the government to take stakes in companies that accept federal funding for semiconductor manufacturing. The measure ultimately died in the Senate. Democrats have also championed the idea of a national infrastructure development bank. At least one proposal for such an entity in 2021 would have allowed the government to take equity stakes in infrastructure projects. And Biden considered launching a sovereign wealth fund. These approaches would have relied on legislation passed by Congress. But the legal basis for the Trump administration's investments is a grey area, Harrell said. The administration seems to rely on the rationale that it can take stakes because the law doesn't explicitly forbid it and the companies have agreed to the deals, he said.  The lack of a clear legal basis makes the companies vulnerable to lawsuits from competitors, Harrell said. They are also likely to face political scrutiny if power changes hands in Washington, he said.\"If Democrats take control of one or both chambers of Congress in November, a bunch of the CEOs of these companies are going to be hauled up in front of committees to answer questions about how these deals are going,\" he said.Companies like MP Materials have acknowledged these risks in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Pentagon's deal with MP includes a price floor and offtake agreement in addition to an equity stake. MP warned investors that it could face \"government audits, investigations, congressional scrutiny\" and \"inquiries about conflicts of interest.\" It also warned the deal faces \"the risk of litigation\" and is vulnerable to \"changes in federal administration and related executive and legislative priorities.\"Congress has also not set clear guardrails to minimize potential conflicts of interest and favoritism in the Trump administration approach, Harrell said. One concern is that the government could favor companies in which it is a shareholder in areas like permitting and contracting, he said. USA Rare Earth was required to raise at least $500 million in private funding as a condition for its deal with the government. Commerce Secretary Lutnick's former firm Cantor Fitzgerald led the placement for that funding. Lutnick stepped down from Cantor when he joined the Trump administration and transferred his stake in the firm to his children. Capital misallocation riskThe equity stakes also raise the question of whether the government can be trusted to make the right bets on companies and technologies that will succeed over the long term, Harrell said. A bad bet would result in capital flowing to less competitive companies, and investors are already speculating on which companies the government will invest in next, Lincicome said. \"That's just straight up capital misallocation,\" he said.Business decisions could also become politicized, he said. Big companies could decide to do business with the government-backed firms to curry favor with the administration, Lincicome said. In the case of U.S. Steel, the federal government has a governance stake, called a golden share, rather than an economic interest in the company. The White House intervened last September to stop U.S. Steel from halting production at its Granite City plant in Illinois\"That's your worst-case scenario, that you start having politicians in Washington directing important business decisions based on political considerations and not what's best for the long-term health of the company,\" Lincicome said. USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in a January interview that the government is taking \"taking an economic interest\" in its business \"not a governance interest.\" Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake in Intel is non-voting and does not include governance rights.\"Maybe they don't have formal voting rights,\" Lincicome said of the government equity stakes. \"But they do have a phone and they can pick up the phone and call. They do have the ability to influence decisions that just don't show up on paper or in a proxy vote.\"And a Democratic president could try to force companies with government stakes to adopt progressive policies like capping executive pay or using unionized labor, Harrell and Lincicome said. Corporate silenceTop executives have voiced virtually no public criticism of the Trump administration taking stakes. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said this week that some executives quietly oppose the interventionist approach. \"When the U.S. government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. The number of government equity stakes is likely to grow. Lutnick told CNBC last August the Pentagon was considering stakes in major defense companies like Lockheed Martin. Trump said in January that he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until the firms accelerate their production of military equipment. Before the U.S. took its stake in Intel, Trump said CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly conflicted\" and called for his resignation over his ties to Chinese companies. The comments sparked a brief sell-off of Intel shares. Other corporate executives are likely worried about crossing the administration and being punished, Lincicome said.\"The best outcome here for your shareholders is just to stay quiet,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares closed up nearly 8% on Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

    "body": "A snow removal machine is seen working while a Boeing 737 American Airlines passenger aircraft is parked at gate on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

I think the Super Bowl is a good barometer for all of this.\"Automakers accounted for 40% of Super Bowl ad minutes in 2012, but dropped all the way to 7% by 2025, according to iSpot.

Adjacencies can be smart.\"During Mahoney's tenure, Subaru became the presenting sponsor of Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl and GM's Chevrolet brand \"blacked out\" TV screens just ahead of the Super Bowl for an ad for its in-vehicle Wi-Fi in 2015.Outside of the Super Bowl, automakers have increased sports advertising and embraced more streaming and regional advertising over national reach, according to iSpot.\"They're not cutting back in live sports,\" Muller said, citing iSpot data that automakers now represent roughly 60% of spend on live sports.Autos outAutomotive executives who spoke to CNBC about not advertising during this year's Super Bowl said they were deterred due to the cost — $8 million on average for a 30-second ad — and felt their ad dollars would be better spent elsewhere.\"We are going to really spread our efforts, so money and creativity, over a year,\" said Stellantis Chief Marketing Officer Olivier Francois, who is well known for past Super Bowl ads. \"There's no need for a peak or something in February.\"Stellantis, which is in the midst of a company turnaround plan, will focus this year on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. as its major marketing push in addition to more business-oriented spending and a provocative social media campaign for Jeep featuring a singing fish it launched this week.Nissan Motor, which last advertised during the Super Bowl in 2022, is also experimenting this year with parallel advertising.The Japan-based automaker on Friday released a comedic, high-energy \"Big Game\" social media ad promoting a chips-and-dip holder for its Nissan Rogue SUV. The \"Nissan Dip Seat\" ad stars chef and \"The Bear\" actor Matty Matheson promoting the fictional product. It also promotes a sweepstakes to win one of the vehicles.\"One of the key things for us is that we wanted to kind of find a way that was more social in nature. It's been a part of what our overall strategy has been this year,\" Nissan U.S. CMO Allyson Witherspoon told CNBC.Witherspoon declined to discuss the cost of the spot, but confirmed it was less than it would have spent to air a traditional Super Bowl ad.Others, such as Honda Motor, will look to the Olympics as their major ad spending. Honda is sponsoring U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams for the Winter Games in Milan this year as well as at the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\"Super Bowl is one moment in time. The Olympics has so many verticals you can dip into and tell these stories,\" said Ed Beadle, who leads marketing for American Honda Motor.The opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics took place on Friday in Milan. It also kicks off a month that Comcast's NBCUniversal — which will be airing the Olympics, Super Bowl and NBA All-Star weekend — has coined \"Legendary February.\" 2026 adsGM remains a wild card for this year's game, as the only automaker to not prerelease its ad. The Detroit automaker is using the Super Bowl to launch its Cadillac F1 team, including revealing the look of its first livery car to a national audience.The automaker last month showed a design prototype of the vehicle in Detroit, including at the city's auto show, but it has not released any information about the commercial.Toyota, the NFL's official automotive partner, is expected to air two 30-second ads focused on family connections. One called \"Superhero Belt\" shows a grandson and a grandfather switching roles over the years and telling each other to secure their seatbelts. The other features athletes including NFL wide receiver Puka Nacua meeting their younger selves.Volkswagen's ad resurrects the automaker's well-known 1990s campaign for a new generation of customers, as part of a marketing drive called \"The Great Invitation: Drivers Wanted.\"The new campaign, including a 30-second Super Bowl spot, features many of the automaker's vehicles being driven around to House of Pain's 1992 hit \"Jump Around.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.Disclosure: CNBC parent Versant is carrying NBC Sports-produced Olympic coverage on its networks, including USA Network and CNBC.",

    "body": "The Trump administration has made unprecedented equity investments and obtained other stakes in at least 10 companies over the past year.Many are in critical mineral companies as the White House plots a strategy to directly back mining companies to build a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China. But the investments also include chipmakers and possibly a nuclear reactor company. In the case of U.S. Steel, the administration has taken a governance stake rather than a direct economic interest. The number of investments is extraordinary outside of wartime or an economic crisis, said Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and a researcher at the libertarian Cato Institute.And the administration's portfolio could keep growing. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the government could take stakes in major defense suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin.  In the past, the U.S. has taken temporary stakes in companies in the context of bailouts, said Peter Harrell, who served as the senior director for international economics under President Joe Biden. \"With these companies, it's a very different thesis,\" Harrell said. \"The government is kind of acting as a strategic investor to put capital into these companies so that these companies can achieve both a commercial return but also, at least in theory, some kind [of] national purpose.\" U.S. SteelPresident Trump secured a \"golden share\" in U.S. Steel as a condition for approving Nippon Steel's acquisition of the historic manufacturer.  The golden share is a governance stake that gives the president veto power over key business decisions. It is not a direct economic stake in U.S. Steel. The president can veto decisions to close, idle or sell U.S. Steel plants. He can also block U.S. Steel from changing its name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh or relocating the company outside the U.S. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the NYSE in June 2025 after becoming a subsidiary of Nippon. MP MaterialsMP Materials is a critical minerals company headquartered in Las Vegas that operates the only commercial rare earth mine in the U.S. at Mountain Pass in California. It has a market value of more than $10 billlion.The Defense Department struck a landmark deal with MP in July 2025 that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an agreement to buy a portion of future output. The Pentagon agreed to buy $400 million of preferred stock and is entitled to a warrant allowing it to purchase additional shares. MP said in July that exercising these options would give the Pentagon a 15% stake, positioning it as the company's largest single shareholder. IntelThe Commerce Department took a 10% stake in Intel in August 2025, buying 433.3 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock at $20.47 per share. Funding for the investment came from $5.7 billion of government grants under the CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion in federal awards under a program to make chips secure. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last August that the stake is non-voting and does not include governance rights. Lithium AmericasLithium Americas is a critical minerals startup with no revenue that is developing a lithium mine in Humboldt County, Nevada called Thacker Pass. It has a $1.5 billion market cap. The Department of Energy took a 5% stake in Lithium Americas and a 5% economic stake in its joint venture with General Motors to develop Thacker Pass. In exchange, the department agreed to defer $182 million of debt service on a $2.3 billion federal loan over five years.\"If we're going to push out part of the repayment into later years, then the administration would like a very small stake of equity to create essentially a cash buffer and eliminate some risk on behalf of taxpayers,\" a Trump administration official told CNBC in September.Lithium Americas is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It trades on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE.Trilogy MetalsTrilogy Metals is another critical minerals startup with no revenue. It aims to develop a mining project in Alaska called Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects using a controversial, 211-mile-long Ambler Road to extract copper and other materials.President Donald Trump approved permits for to construct Ambler Road in October and the administration invested $35.6 million in the project. The investment makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5% of the company. Trilogy is also headquartered in Vancouver and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the NYSE. USA Rare EarthUSA Rare Earth is yet another critical minerals startup that is also not generating any revenue yet. It is developing a magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma and plans to build a rare earth mine at a deposit called Round Top in Texas. USA Rare Earth has a $4.6 billion market capitalization.The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent on Jan. 26 to provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding.In exchange, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants to the U.S. The government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company, depending on whether the warrants are exercised. CEO Barbara Humpton told CNBC in an interview that the government is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest.\"WestinghouseWestinghouse is a private nuclear reactor developer. It is owned by publicly traded Cameco, a Canadian uranium miner, and Brookfield Asset Management. The Commerce Department signed a deal with Cameco and Brookfield in October to finance the construction of Westinghouse nuclear plants worth $80 billion. Under the deal, the government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value rises above $30 billion.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under that scenario, Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in November 2025. Vulcan ElementsVulcan Elements is a private startup based in Durham, North Carolina. Vulcan entered into a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to build a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. Vulcan will build a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S. It will receive a $620 million loan from the Pentagon, $550 million of incentives from the Commerce Department and raise $550 million in private capital.Under the deal, Commerce will receive a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan and the Pentagon gets warrants in the company. XLightXLight is a private company headquartered in Palo Alto, California that is developing free-electron lasers to manufacture semiconductors. The Commerce Department in December issued a letter of intent to provide xLight with up to $150 million in federal incentives. In exchange, Commerce would receive a $150 million equity stake in xLight.L3HarrisL3Harris Technologies is a defense company with more than $65 billion market cap. It announced a proposed partnership with the U.S. government in December in which the Pentagon would invest $1 billion in its rocket motor business, whose motors are used in missile systems.Under the terms of the investment, L3Harris would launch an initial public offering of its missile business in the second half of 2026, at which point the Pentagon's $1 billion investment would convert into common equity of the spun off division.

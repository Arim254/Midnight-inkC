    "body": "Peloton stationary bikes for sale at the company's showroom in Dedham, Massachusetts, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 3,  2021. Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton is recalling its original Bike+ after receiving reports that the seat post broke and detached from the equipment during use, leading to two injuries, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in a news release Thursday. The recall impacts 833,000 units, touching every original Bike+ the company sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022. The bikes were sold between January 2020 and April 2025, but Peloton stopped manufacturing them in 2022. The recall comes after Peloton received two reports of injuries \"due to a fall\" after the post broke off, the CPSC said in its release. It received three reports in total about the issue.  The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the bikes and contact Peloton for free repair. The company is offering a free seat post that users can install at home, the agency said. In a statement Thursday, Peloton said, \"The integrity of our products and our Members' well-being are our top priorities.\" The company encouraged users to request the new part \"as soon as possible.\"The notice Thursday marks the second time Peloton has had to recall one of its bike models due to issues with the seat post. In May 2023, the company recalled every base Bike model that it ever sold, totaling 2.2 million units, after receiving 35 reports of the seat post breaking and detaching during use. The issue led to 13 injuries, including a fractured wrist, lacerations and bruises.At the time, the company said the recall led to higher-than-expected membership churn, as between 15,000 and 20,000 people paused their monthly subscriptions while waiting for the seat post to be replaced. Replacing the parts cost at least $40 million during its fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, the company said at the time. The recall Thursday, the fifth since Peloton's founding, comes as CEO Peter Stern looks to get the fitness company back to growth and move past the many issues it has faced since its founding. Changing consumer dynamics have plagued the company since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, but so have its recalls, including one for its Tread+ treadmill in 2021 after a child was killed. Just over a month ago, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, raised prices and unveiled new features ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. The current quarter is Peloton's biggest for hardware sales. The company is expected to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings after the bell on Thursday.Clarification: This story was updated to clarify that the recall affects every original Bike+ sold that was manufactured between 2019 and 2022.",

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro's prosecutors previously failed to get a grand jury in D.C. to indict the 37-year-old on a felony assault charge. Pirro's office then filed a misdemeanor charge against him, which went to trial this week. Jurors began deliberations on Wednesday.Dunn was charged in connection with tossing a sandwich at Customs and Border Protection Officer Greg Lairmore on on Aug. 10 along the U Street nightlife corridor in Washington.Lairmore and other federal authorities were deployed in D.C. by President Donald Trump in response to what the president claimed was rampant crime in the capital city.\"F--- you! You f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn allegedly shouted at a group of federal officers before hurling the sandwich at one of them. Dunn was fired by the DOJ, where he worked in the criminal division's international affairs section, after his arrest.A person walks past art work depicting former DOJ employee Sean Charles Dunn is displayed against a restaurant wall on August 17, 2025 in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesDunn's attorney, Sabrina Shroff, during closing arguments on Wednesday said that the confrontation was the result of his \"strongly held feelings\" about immigration enforcement, NBC News reported.Shroff also told jurors that \"you are the ones impacted by the executive orders\" issued by Trump which put federal law enforcement officers on the streets of D.C., NBC reported.\"You are the ones impacted by the executive orders … there was and remains a huge law enforcement presence in the district,' Shroff said.The defense attorney also argued that the, \"The sandwich did not impede Officer Lairmore's duties that night ....  A footlong from Subway could not and certainly did not inflict bodily harm,\" NBC reported.Shroff also noted that Lairmore had received two \"gag gifts\" from co-workers, a plush sandwich and a patch featuring a cartoon of Dunn throwing the sandwich with the words \"Felony Footlong,' according to the outlet.\"If someone assaulted you, if someone offended you, would you keep a  memento of their assault? Would you stick it on your daily lunchbox and carry it with you day in and day out?\" she asked.This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "Wegovy injection pens arranged in Waterbury, Vermont, US, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of their blockbuster weight loss drugs. Under the agreements, the monthly out-of-pocket cost of popular injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has, Trump administration officials said. Existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy, carry list prices above $1,000 a month, which has prevented many patients from taking them. Both companies have introduced lower cost options for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites.But the deals with Trump, as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy, take those efforts to expand access even further. Here's how much weight loss drugs could cost for patients under the new agreements, based on the details shared so far.Medicare Medicare has covered GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and some other medical conditions: for example, Wegovy for slashing cardiovascular risks. But under the new deals, Medicare will start covering the drugs for obesity for the first time starting in mid-2026, which could allow more seniors to qualify for them and spur more private insurers to cover them.Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Patients are eligible if they fall into these three cohorts:The first includes those who are overweight — with a body mass index greater than 27 — or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure.The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk voluntarily agreed to reduce the prices the government pays for existing GLP-1 drugs already approved for diabetes and other uses to $245 a month, across all non-starting doses. Savings generated by those price reductions will allow Medicare to start paying that same price point for GLP-1s for patients with obesity and a high metabolic or cardiovascular risk. Direct-to-consumerThe agreement will also allow patients to get GLP-1s on direct-to-consumer platforms at steeper discounts than they already receive through drugmakers' existing sites.On TrumpRx – the government's direct-to-consumer platform for buying prescription drugs with cash expected to launch next year – the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior administration officials.Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid. Under the deals announced Thursday, the drugmakers will get fast-track reviews of their forthcoming pills. Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per monthMedicaidState Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 drugs for obesity is spotty. But Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other non-starting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not. Check with your state government about coverage.",

    "body": "The ESPN Bet logo on a laptop arranged in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDisney's ESPN is swapping out its sports betting partner.In separate releases Thursday, the company said it was terminating its agreement with Penn Entertainment years earlier than planned and had signed an agreement with DraftKings to make it the exclusive official sportsbook and odds provider for ESPN.Both changes take effect in December.\"Our betting approach has focused on offering an integrated experience within our products,\" ESPN Chariman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement. \"Working with DraftKings, a leader in the space, will allow us to build upon that foundation, continue to super-serve passionate sports fans and grow our ESPN direct-to-consumer business.\"Under the partnership, DraftKings will power ESPN's mobile betting tab.\"ESPN's unmatched visibility across the world of sports make this collaboration a natural fit,\" said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins in a statement. \"As an innovative leader in digital sports entertainment, DraftKings is uniquely positioned to integrate our technology and products with ESPN's iconic brand and storytelling power.\"ESPN inked its previous deal with Penn in 2023 after spending some time looking for a gambling partner. Disney had made clear in the past it would never take bets directly, making a partnership the only viable path for ESPN to get into the booming online sports gambling industry.Sports betting has become an integral part of ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming platform.ESPN and Penn's partnership allowed for ESPN to rebrand and relaunch Penn's sportsbook — then known as Barstool Sportsbook — as ESPN Bet.The agreement had a 10-year term but allowed for either ESPN or Penn to end the agreement after the third year \"if specific market share performance thresholds were not met,\" according to the news release.And on Thursday, Penn and ESPN announced they had agreed to wind down the partnership after just two years. Penn's sportsbook will be rebranded again as theScore Bet.\"When we first announced our partnership with ESPN, both sides made it clear that we expected to compete for a podium position in the space,\" said Penn CEO Jay Snowden in a news release.\"Although we made significant progress in improving our product offering and building a cohesive ecosystem with ESPN, we have mutually and amicably agreed to wind down our collaboration,\" he said.Under the original deal, ESPN agreed to provide Penn with the exclusive right to its brand for the sportsbook, as well as media and marketing services. In exchange, Penn agreed to pay ESPN $1.5 billion in cash over the 10-year period, and also granted ESPN about $500 million of warrants to buy roughly 31.8 million Penn common shares that would vest over the same period.On Thursday the companies said Penn's $150 million in yearly cash payments will cease in the fourth quarter, as would the warrants to buy Penn's common stock.",

    "body": "People walk to their car after shopping at a Target store on Oct. 3, 2025, in Jersey City, New Jersey.Gary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty ImagesCustomers used to hold up Target as an example of how to run large, yet sparkling stores.Yet in recent years, shopper complaints about sloppier aisles, longer checkout lines, locked-up merchandise and out-of-stock items have dogged the Minneapolis-based retailer, contributing to sagging sales.To help fix that, Target is making a move that may seem counterintuitive: It's shaking up its online strategy. The move is a response to Target's unique strategy of fulfilling the vast majority of its e-commerce orders at its stores, which has stretched employees and inventory thin.The company is now rolling out a new approach that designates only some of its stores as locations where employees pick and pack orders in cardboard boxes to ship to customers' homes. Other stores have stopped fulfilling those orders entirely.The company has expanded that plan to 36 markets as of the end of October, more than half of its 60 markets, after a successful pilot in the Chicago area, said Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer. It plans to expand that further in 2026.The new digital strategy marks a shift for Target, which announced in 2017 that its stores would power the e-commerce side of the business. Target does not rely on huge fulfillment centers like Amazon. It instead has store employees pick products and pack them in cardboard boxes in backrooms to prepare most of its online orders — or about 98% in the most recently reported quarter. That turned all of Target's nearly 2,000 locations into fulfillment hubs.Target is trying to break a streak of about four years of roughly flat annual sales as two-decade Target veteran and Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke gets ready to start as CEO in February. Fiddelke said on Target's earnings call in August that improving the customer experience is one of his top priorities, along with regaining Target's reputation for style and design and using technology to run a more efficient business.In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said the company's \"stores as hubs\" strategy made the retailer's e-commerce business both \"cost-efficient\" and \"capital light\" by relying on the facilities and workforce it already had.Target's digital sales have more than tripled since the Covid pandemic, jumping from about $6.6 billion in the fiscal year that ended in early 2020 to nearly $21 billion in the fiscal year that ended in early 2025.But growth brought new challenges as attention and staffing got diverted to e-commerce, he added.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"\"One of the things we're focused on is, 'How can we remove some of that complexity?'\" he said.Read moreFewer boxes and more predictabilityTarget started the Chicago pilot project in May to designate stores that would continue to fulfill ship-to-home deliveries, McCarthy said.Instead of having all 100 stores in the greater Chicago area pack the brown boxes, it's concentrated ship-to-home fulfillment at a smaller number of locations. Eighteen stores have stopped fulfilling the online orders altogether and six locations ramped up shipping, McCarthy said.Five stores in the region now handle about 30% of the ship-to-home volume in the Chicago market, she said.All Target locations, however, will continue to fulfill orders for customers who pick up online purchases curbside or in stores.\"The store is still very much the hub of everything that we do,\" McCarthy said. \"We're just getting more precise and maybe a little bit more refined in how we're using all of those stores and our supply chain network.\"Target typically chose the locations that will handle higher volumes of ship-to-home orders because they had more space to pack boxes, lower foot traffic or a combination of both.The change has brought several key benefits for Target, McCarthy said. Delivery trucks make fewer stops at stores, which saves transportation time and costs. Stores that pack delivery boxes can better plan their staffing. Customers have a longer window to order next-day delivery, as the company turns select locations into specialists.In Chicago, for example, the cutoff time for next-day delivery is now 6 p.m. instead of noon, McCarthy said.Yet one of the most notable changes for Target has been improvement in the store experience as employees have tasks to juggle to fulfill shipping orders, she said. In stores that no longer pick and pack brown boxes in Chicago, out-of-stocks have improved, in-store sales have risen, and the company's surveys of shoppers measuring store cleanliness and the quality of employee interactions increased by 10%, she said.Digital experiences for customers, which measure customers' satisfaction with Target's curbside or in-store pickup, improved, too.Mike Deyle, group vice president for Target who oversees most stores in the Chicago area, said he attributes the improvements to employees having \"more capacity to focus on both the in-store experience and the digital experience.\"But McCarthy added that Target hasn't seen the same level of store experience improvements in the locations still picking and packing the boxes — a puzzle that the company wants to solve.Target Corp. packages sit at the United States Postal Service (USPS) Merrifield processing and distribution center in Merrifield, Virginia.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStill more to fixYet Target's new approach for fulfillment won't address all of shoppers' concerns.Store traffic has fallen nearly every week since February, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. That falling foot traffic reflects a mix of economic challenges, such as financial pressures on households from higher grocery prices, and company-specific issues, such as weaker merchandise, stiffer competition and customer backlash to the company's stance on diversity, equity and inclusion.Some shoppers have pointed out other aspects of some Target stores that have turned them off, such as locked-up items to prevent theft and long checkout lines.Through a spokesman, Target declined to specify the number of stores that lock up everyday staples like deodorant, but said the majority of locations only lock high-value products like electronics.Meanwhile, Target has tried to strike the right balance between staffed checkout lanes and self-checkout. In March 2024, it also capped almost all self-checkout lanes at 10 items or fewer to try to speed up the process, a move that Target said led to better customer experiences.Compared with many big-box and warehouse club competitors, Target's in-store experience remains a strength, but its advantage has weakened over the past four years, according to HundredX, a customer data insights firm which surveys shoppers about their brand experience.For example, customers rated Target 35 points higher than superstore competitors including Walmart, Sam's Club and Costco in atmosphere/cleanliness in October 2021, but that edge slipped to 20 points higher than rivals in October 2025.But Target underperformed the same retail rivals on availability of items, HundredX found, based on its trailing six-month average of customer ratings as of this month. More than 43,000 customers have participated in HundedX's surveys in the last 12 months.Forty-three percent of Target customers had a favorable rating for its availability compared with 47% for retail peers. Shoppers who said they had positive experiences cited the close proximity of Target's locations and availability of items for curbside or in-store pickup. On the other hand, customers with a negative perception cited stock consistency in stores as their top complaint.Emily Haleck, a mom of three who lives in Lehi, Utah, and runs a business consulting firm, said she frequently visited Target when her kids were younger. Yet the store fell out of her routine as she noticed messier aisles, particularly the sloppy piles and mismatched hangers in the clothing section. She said she shops Target's stores only about three or four times a year and makes weekly runs to Walmart, where she said she buys groceries and finds lower prices.About a week ago, Haleck and her teenage daughter visited her local Target store in American Fork to find a birthday gift for her son.They bought a Champion water bottle and Starburst candies for her son, a bathmat for her boys' bathroom, makeup and conditioner for her daughter, and a $3 Christmas tree for her daughter's room, along with two shirts for herself that she plans to return.She said the experience felt the same as it had in recent years, with a long checkout line and \"clothing chaos.\"At a time when Target is cutting about 8% of its corporate workforce, some analysts think Target needs to step up its investment in its stores. Scot Ciccarelli, a retail analyst for Truist, said he wants to see the company spend significantly more to better compete with rivals on price and improve store operations, including through more staffing and better technology.\"You can't keep cutting costs,\" he said. \"You can't cut your way to prosperity.\"He said if Target doesn't make investments, it will continue to lose market share.Fiddelke told CNBC that the company is \"always looking at what's the right level of staffing in our store,\" but said it's focused on reducing complexity to free up employees rather than adding to the payroll. He said Target will keep investing in store openings and remodels.Fiddelke added Target's internal metrics show its in-stock levels have improved sequentially over the past three quarters, and frequently purchased items are more reliably in stock.During the busy shopping season, he said customers should expect Target to have better in-stocks than they saw a year ago.But he said the company has more work to do on the other side of the holidays.",

    "body": "Shoppers carry bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHoliday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday.NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group's conference call on that those hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market.\" It's a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said.Some companies may have hired seasonal workers early to support sales events in October, but retailers have largely tried to limit their spending as they manage higher costs from tariffs, NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said.The major industry group's prediction offers the latest glimpse into the jobs market as the record government shutdown stretches on and leads to fewer government reports on economic data, such as unemployment and inflation. That's caused companies and economists to rely on data from private companies or organizations instead.Earlier Thursday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said layoff announcements soared in October to 153,074, a 183% jump from September and 175% surge from the same month a year ago. That marked the highest level for any October since 2003, and 2025 has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.On the other hand, payrolls processing firm ADP reported net job growth in October of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.Higher spending, lower hiringEven with the lower levels of seasonal staffing, the NRF is optimistic holiday spending will be strong. It said it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent 3.7% to 4.2% year-over-year growth from the previous holiday season, a slight decrease from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Even with low consumer sentiment, a prolonged government shutdown, \"on-again-off-again tariffs\" and price sensitivity because of inflation, Shay said consumers have defied expectations and kept spending.\"In fairness, that's been somewhat of a surprise based on where we thought we might be way back in April,\" he said.He said the trade group anticipates that dynamic will persist during the key holiday shopping season. Households typically cut back during other parts of the year or on other parts of the budget to make it a festive time, he said.Even as consumers continue to spend, the retail industry has taken a cautious stance on hiring — a fact reflected in NRF's predictions for seasonal workers. It is the fourth slowest year for retail hiring on a year-to-date basis since at least 2000, behind only 2009, 2010 and 2012, several of the years following the Great Recession.Mathews told CNBC in an interview that the slow hiring environment all comes down to one word: uncertainty.\"The one thing you know businesses do when they are in uncertain environments is they put things on hold,\" he told CNBC in an interview.On NRF's conference call on Thursday, Mathews said the U.S. economy doesn't need the same level of job creation as it used to because of demographic and policy shifts, including the retirement of Baby Boomers and President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.Still, he said, the level of hiring and investment by companies will be an important indicator to watch in the coming year.Right now, he said, a flood of investment in artificial intelligence has been \"a huge boon for the economy.\" But he added \"that may be covering up a few cracks.\"\"We need to keep a close eye on on how businesses are feeling and what remains an uncertain environment,\" he said.",

    "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill and Coach store logos.Getty ImagesChipotle and Cava pinned weaker sales on younger customers who are pulling back and packing lunches.But Gen Z shoppers are still spending on Coach handbags to bring to work — even if they're skipping bowls and burritos.Coach's parent company, Tapestry, raised its full-year outlook Thursday, after beating Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue and posting double-digit sales gains in North America.In an interview with CNBC, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said the company's sales in the quarter were fueled by attracting new customers, particularly within Gen Z.Tapestry, which also includes Kate Spade, acquired more than 2.2 million new customers globally in its fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by growth in Gen Z consumers compared with the prior year. The company said that generation, which is typically defined as spanning in age from roughly 13 to 29, accounted for about 35% of new customers.\"The Gen Z consumer, specifically, is highly fashion engaged, spending slightly more of their budget on fashion,\" she said.Blurred pedestrians walk past an illuminated Coach New York logo at a storefront in a shopping mall, on June 23, 2025 in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesCrevoiserat added those younger customers have a high retention rate, \"maybe busting a myth that these customers, Gen Z customers, aren't sticky or loyal.\"Here's what the company reported for the fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.38 vs. $1.26 expectedRevenue: $1.70 billion vs. $1.64 billion expectedTapestry's net income in the three-month period that ended Sept. 27 rose to $274.8 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $186.6 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago period.It hiked its full-year outlook for both sales and profits, saying it now expects revenue around $7.3 billion for the year, which would be 4% or 5% growth from the prior year, compared with its prior expectations of nearly $7.2 billion. For earnings per diluted share, it now expects a range of $5.45 to $5.60, higher than its prior guidance of $5.30 to $5.45.Despite the raised forecast and better than-expected quarterly results, Tapestry's shares fell about 9% in premarket trading.With its Gen Z strength, Tapestry defied some other companies' assessments on the health of younger shoppers.Cava saw demand among the 25- to 34-year-old consumers fall as the fast-casual chain entered its current quarter, CFO Tricia Tolivar said in an interview with CNBC. She attributed a pullback to younger diners' higher unemployment rate, their greater likelihood of facing the student loan repayments that resumed in the spring and tariffs creating \"an overall fog for the consumer.\"Chipotle's CEO Scott Boatwright similarly said the chain is seeing younger diners visit less frequently, especially those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old.And some holiday forecasts have also reflected a predicted drop in spending by Gen Z. According to consulting firm PwC's holiday survey, Gen Z plans to cut average holiday spending the most among generations surveyed compared to the year-ago period — with respondents in that age group saying they plan to spend 23% less.Deloitte found a similar trend, with Gen Z consumers saying in its separate survey that they plan to spend an average of 34% less this holiday season than a year ago. Weakness carried into the next oldest generation, as millennials — respondents between ages 29 and 44 in the poll — said they expect to spend an average of 13% less this holiday season.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Biotechnology Center is shown in San Diego, California, March 1, 2023.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Thursday said it will start late-stage trials on its experimental amylin obesity drug next month after it showed encouraging results in a mid-stage study.The highest dose of the weekly injection, called eloralintide, helped patients with obesity or who are overweight lose 20.1% of their body weight on average at 48 weeks. The results support the pharmaceutical giant's efforts to bring next-generation treatments to the blockbuster weight loss drug market, and solidify its dominance in the segment. The data bolsters Eli Lilly's chances of bringing a strong competitor to the red-hot amylin space, in particular. Many industry analysts view so-called amylin analogs as the next wave of obesity treatments that could serve as an alternative or complementary option to existing injections targeting gut hormone GLP-1. Several large drugmakers such as Roche and AbbVie have shelled out billions to buy or license experimental amylin treatments, and Novo Nordisk is developing its own drugs. Novo Nordisk — Eli Lilly's chief rival in the obesity market — and Pfizer are also in the midst of a heated takeover war over Metsera, whose pipeline includes a potential once-monthly amylin drug. Amylin analogs mimic a hormone co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas to suppress appetite and reduce food intake. Amylin treatments have a similar effect to GLP-1s like Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro, but some analysts and researchers say it could be easier for patients to tolerate and help them preserve lean muscle mass. The lowest dose of Eli Lilly's injection helped people lose 9.5% of their weight at 48 weeks, compared to 0.4% among those who received a placebo. Patients who used a two-step dose escalation – starting at a 6 milligram dose and increasing to a 9 milligram dose – lost 19.9% of their weight at 48 weeks. People who used a three-step dose escalation that started at 3 milligrams lost 16.4% of their weight.The most common side effects of the injection were mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue, which were observed more frequently in patients who took higher doses of the drug, according to Eli Lilly. Patients in groups that gradually increased doses of the drug saw lower side effects. The company has yet to release detailed data on side effect rates and how many patients discontinued the treatment during the trial. Eli Lilly will present the data at the ObesityWeek scientific conference in Atlanta on Thursday.",

Transportation Committee hearing on aviation safety and the future of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, in the Hart Building in Washington, D.C., Oct. 29, 2019.Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Texas on Thursday dismissed a criminal conspiracy case against Boeing over two crashes of its 737 Max jetliner that killed 346 people, despite expressing sharp skepticism about the wisdom of the Department of Justice's request that he toss the case.Some families of victims of the crashes had strongly opposed the DOJ's move in May asking Judge Reed O'Connor to dismiss the case in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth.The DOJ, which had accused Boeing of deceiving federal regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the crashes, at the time of the dismissal request said Boeing had agreed to pay or invest $1.1 billion in fines and compensation for victims' families.The dismissal comes more than a year after Boeing and the DOJ said they had reached an agreement that required the company to plead guilty and serve a term of probation.The first crash, of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia occurred in late October 2018, and the second crash, of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, occurred nearly five months later, in March 2019.O'Connor, in his dismissal order, said that victims' families who opposed the dismissal \"are correct\" that a nonprosecution agreement that the DOJ reached with Boeing \"fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public.\"O'Connor agreed with them that the agreement \"disregards the need for Boeing to be subject to independent monitoring.\"But the judge wrote that he did not have authority to deny the dismissal request even though he \"disagrees with the Government that dismissing the criminal information in this case is in the public interest.\"\"The Court recognizes that 'in every political institution a power to advance the publichappiness involves a discretion that may be abused.,'\" O'Connor wrote, citing one of the Federalist Papers.\"Nevertheless, poor discretion may not be countered with judicial overreach,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win

had been selected for the trial of one of those cases in Chicago federal court.In a statement Thursday about the dismissal of the criminal case, Boeing said, \"We are committed to honoring the obligations of our agreement with the Department of Justice.\"\"We are also committed to continuing the significant efforts we have made as a company to strengthen our safety, quality, and compliance programs,\" the company said.The DOJ criminally charged Boeing in January 2021 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for the company's alleged obstruction of the Federal Aviation Administration's evaluation of the Max's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system.At the same time that case was filed, the DOJ said it had entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing, which effectively suspended the case's prosecution.But in May 2024, the DOJ told O'Connor that Boeing had breached the deferred prosecution deal by \"failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\"In July 2024, the DOJ and Boeing submitted a plea agreement to O'Connor that called for the company to plead guilty.O'Connor rejected the plea agreement because its terms \"were not in the public interest,\" the judge noted in his order Thursday.In May, months after President Donald Trump entered the White House for a second term, the DOJ asked O'Connor to dismiss the case altogether.O'Connor in his order questioned the DOJ's rationale for the nonprosecution agreement that was part of the dismissal request.\"The Government now believes that Boeing can be trusted to select a compliance consultantbecause Boeing has made 'meaningful progress in improving its anti-fraud compliance and ethics programs,'\" O'Connor wrote.\"In summary, the Government's position in this lawsuit has been that Boeing committed crimes sufficient to justify prosecution, failed to remedy its fraudulent behavior on its own during the [Deferred Prosecution Agreement] which justified a guilty plea and the imposition of an independent monitor, but now Boeing will remedy that dangerous culture by retaining a consultant of its own choosing.\"\"Given Boeing's history related to this case (and the Government's continued failure to gain Boeing's compliance), the Movants are correct that this agreement fails to secure the necessary accountability to ensure the safety of the flying public,\" O'Connor wrote.The judge also wrote that he found the DOJ's claim that there was \"uncertainty and litigation risk\" from going to trial in the case to be \"unserious.\"\"The Government has a confession from Boeing, signed by the CEO and Chief Legal Officer, admitting to all the elements of the conspiracy charge against it in the DPA,\" O'Connor said. \"As such, the assertion that there is a legitimate risk that Boeing would be acquitted at a trial lacks support.\"",

The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.Suleyman was a co-founder of AI lab DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. After leaving Google in 2022, he co-founded and led AI startup Inflection. Microsoft hired Suleyman and several other Inflection employees last year.Top technology companies have rushed to hire leading AI engineers and researchers, augmenting their products with generative AI capabilities. The boom started with OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Microsoft uses OpenAI models in Bing and Copilot, while OpenAI runs workloads in Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft also owns a $135 billion equity stake in OpenAI following a restructuring.Microsoft has taken steps to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. After the Inflection deal, the software company also began drawing on models from Google and from Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI executives.The new Microsoft AI research group will focus on providing useful companions for people that can help in education and other domains, Suleyman wrote in his blog post. It will also pursue narrow areas in medicine and in renewable energy production.\"We'll have expert level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings,\" Suleyman wrote.As investors and analysts are increasingly voicing their concerns about overspending on AI without a clear path to profits, Suleyman said he wants \"to make clear that we are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits.\" WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) takes the stage on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) at the United Center, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., August 21, 2024.Kevin Wurm | ReutersNancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who made history as the first female speaker of the House of Representatives, said Thursday she will not seek reelection to Congress next year.Pelosi, 85, has served in the House for nearly four decades, presiding over the passage of major legislation and serving as a leading opposition figure against President Donald Trump.\"There has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, 'I speak for the people of San Francisco,'\" Pelosi said in a video posted on social media.\"I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress,\" she said. \"That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know: I will not be seeking reelection to Congress.\"\"With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative,\" Pelosi said.Pelosi became the most powerful woman in congressional history in 2002, when she was elected House minority leader by her fellow Democrats.When the party took majority control of the chamber in 2007, Pelosi became the first — and so far only — woman to wield the speaker's gavel.The new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (Left) (D-Ca.) waves the gavel after receiving it from John Boehner (R-OH) on Jan 4th, 2007.The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesShe held the title until Democrats lost their House majority in 2011. When the party won the chamber back in 2019, Pelosi served as House speaker for a second time.After Republicans regained majority control of the House following the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped aside as the Democrats' leader. But she remained in Congress, and was referred to as speaker emerita.\"Nancy Pelosi has inspired generations,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in an X post later Thursday morning.\"Her courage and conviction to San Francisco, California, and our nation has set the standard for what public service should be. Her impact on this nation is unmatched,\" Newsom said.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsTrump slammed Pelosi following her retirement announcement, calling it \"a great thing for America.\"\"She was evil, corrupt and only focused on bad things for our country,\" Trump told a Fox News reporter. \"She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I'm very honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician.\"Under Pelosi's leadership, the House passed seismic bills that created sweeping change across the country.Perhaps most notably, she was instrumental to the passage in the House of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. The health-care law, which has survived numerous attempts by Republicans to repeal it, is now at the center of an ongoing government shutdown.During her second stint as speaker, Pelosi clashed openly with Trump — inside and outside the White House.In a heated clash at a White House meeting in 2019 on the administration's withdrawal of troops from Syria, Pelosi stood up and raised a finger to Trump. The then-president released a photo of the moment, claiming Pelosi had an \"unhinged meltdown\" — but Pelosi embraced the image, displaying it atop her Twitter profile.President Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressional leadership Wednesday Oct. 16 2019 in the Cabinet Room of the White House.Hum Images | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesPelosi also presided over the first impeachment of Trump in the House in December 2019. The charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemmed from accusations that Trump had pressured Ukraine's president to launch investigations into his political foes.Trump was acquitted in the Senate.Pelosi has remained a vocal Trump critic. In a recent CNN interview, she called Trump a \"vile creature\" and \"worst thing on the face of the Earth.\"Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in the House.",

    "body": "watch nowChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Thursday expressed hesitation about lowering interest rates further because the government shutdown has resulted in a blackout on key inflation data.While Goolsbee has otherwise been an advocate for gradually lowering rates, the central bank official said during a CNBC interview that he has concerns over the lack of important price reports, particularly with general inflation recently trending higher.\"If there are problems developing on the inflation side, it's going to be a fair amount bit of time before we see that, where if it starts to deteriorate on the job market side, we're going to see that pretty much right away,\" Goolsbee said. \"So that makes me even more uneasy ... with front-loading rate cuts and counting on the inflation that we have seen in the last three months to just be transitory and assume that they're going to go away.\"Goolsbee spoke as the Chicago Fed updated its own dashboard of labor market indicators. The data set indicated a stable unemployment rate in October and a steady pace of hirings and layoffs. The Chicago Fed's unemployment rate indicator was at 4.36% for the month, up just one one-hundredth of a percentage point from September.However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't release its consumer price index report for October, which had been scheduled for next week.The BLS did put out a report for September despite the shutdown, as that particular count is used for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. That report showed inflation running at a 3% annual rate, compared with the Fed's goal of 2%. Whether the Commerce Department releases its personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, depends on getting the shutdown resolved.Goolsbee said the lack of inflation reports concerns him, as three-month trends before the shutdown showed core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, running at a 3.6% annualized pace.\"Medium-run, I'm not hawkish on rates. I believe that the settling point for rates is going to be a fair bit below where it is today,\" he said. \"When it's foggy, let's just be a little careful and slow down.\"Goolsbee will get a vote when the Federal Open Market Committee meets in December to decide whether to cut rates again following reductions at the prior two meetings. However, he will rotate to being an alternate in 2026 before returning to a voting role in 2027.watch now",

    "body": "The National Thanksgiving turkeys, Blossom and Peach, wait before being pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden during a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on November 25, 2024 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe price of turkeys is soaring this Thanksgiving, and experts say consumers will have to hunt around to find a bargain for those birds.Driving the price hikes is a stressed turkey supply chain.The U.S. turkey flock has dropped to its lowest size in nearly 40 years because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.As a result, wholesale turkey prices have surged 75% since October 2024, according to an analysis by the Purdue University College of Agriculture.Wholesale turkey prices averaged 94 cents per pound at that point last year, compared with $1.71 per pound last month, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.Purdue University's model predicts that the average retail price of a turkey will be approximately $2.05 per pound in November, which is 25% higher than a year ago, costing consumers about $31 for a 15-pound bird.Purdue analysts emphasized that the actual retail price range of turkeys is wide because of differences in quality — organic or pasture-raised turkeys cost more.The timing of the turkey orders by retailers also is critical in determining price.\"Retailers that didn't secure their turkey orders early may face steep spot market prices, which could impact availability and cost,\" wrote Dr. Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute.\"In contrast, those who waited may now be facing steep spot market prices,\" Swanson said.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesConsumers could end up paying $20 more for a 16-pound turkey if they buy it from a retailer who purchased it on the spot market, compared with what it would cost at a retailer who purchased the turkey earlier on the wholesale market.\"This year, where you shop could make a big difference, and savvy consumers may find significant savings by comparing options,\" Swanson said.Major retailers who placed early orders appear to be leveraging their turkeys as a draw to bring shoppers into stores, according to Swanson.Walmart is offering a dinner bundle, which includes a 16-pound turkey and sides, for under $56 for 10 people.A Thanksgiving bundle from Aldi's sells for $40 and feeds 10 people. Amazon is offering its own Thanksgiving dinner promotion for $25. Target on Wednesday announced a $20 Thanksgiving deal for four.Other grocers, such as ShopRite and Foodtown, are offering customers a free 10-to-20-pound store-brand turkey if they spend $400 by Thanksgiving. BJ's is running a similar promotion for $150.Wells Fargo's annual Thanksgiving food report shows that the typical cost of a turkey dinner for consumers is higher than those deals. A holiday menu that uses all store-brand items costs $80, while a menu with all national name brands totals $95, Wells Fargo's report said.\"Our report shows consumers spending more this Thanksgiving than on the retail promotions because we lean into a mix of prepared items and items that need assembly, which cost more versus making items from scratch,\" Swanson said.\"That mix in our view, more accurately portrays what we expect consumers to use for the meal this year.\"  In addition to the timing of purchases, the strength of supply-chain relationships between grocers and the farmers they work with has enabled some retailers to keep turkey prices from soaring.Customers push shopping carts outside a Stew Leonard's supermarket in Paramus, New Jersey, U.S., on Tuesday, May 12, 2020. Stew Leonard Jr. said that meat packing plant the company uses is operating at about 70 percent capacity, and he expects it to rebound to full capacity in about a month, CT Post reported.Angus Mordant | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStew Leonard's — which operates a small chain of grocery stores in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey — said it was able to keep its turkey prices the same as last year because of its longstanding relationship with its bird supplier.\"We have been working with the same farm for decades, and the farm hasn't been impacted by bird flu,\" said Stew Leonard Jr., the chain's CEO.Thanksgiving dinner traditionally is considered one of the most affordable holiday meals, because red meat is not typically served.But given the increase in turkey prices, Leonard said, ham is a good alternative option for a Thanksgiving main course.Consumers could also opt to go to a butcher or store that will sell dark turkey meat or parts, which would cost less than a whole bird, he said.The reduction in flock size has led to layoffs for poultry producers.Perdue Farms in September announced it was laying off nearly 300 employees at an Indiana turkey plant, reportedly because of bird flu and a consumer shift toward other meats.One farmer who supplies Perdue said he lost 48,000 turkeys after a flu test came back positive.The USDA is forecasting an increase in turkey production in 2026, assuming the avian flu abates.But because of the current size of the flock, prices are not expected to drop considerably in 2026.The top eight states for turkey production are Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Virginia, Iowa and Pennsylvania. Turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota were hit with an outbreak of the flu in September.No new data on turkeys and agriculture is expected to be released by the USDA due to the government shutdown, which on Wednesday became the longest shutdown in U.S. history.",

    "body": "Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle is making its most powerful chip yet widely available, the search giant's latest effort to try and win business from artificial intelligence companies by offering custom silicon.The company said on Thursday that the seventh generation of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), called Ironwood, will hit the market for public use in the coming weeks, after it was initially introduced in April for testing and deployment.The chip, built in-house, is designed to handle everything from the training of large models to powering real-time chatbots and AI agents. In connecting up to 9,216 chips in a single pod, Google says the new Ironwood TPUs eliminate \"data bottlenecks for the most demanding models\" and give customers \"the ability to run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\"Google is in the midst of an ultra high-stakes race, alongside rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, to build out the AI infrastructure of the future. While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), Google's TPUs fall into the category of custom silicon, which can offer advantages on price, performance and efficiency.TPUs have been in the works for a decade. Ironwood, according to Google, is more than four times faster than its predecessor, and major customers are already lining up. AI startup Anthropic plans to use up to 1 million of the new TPUs to run its Claude model, Google said.Alongside the new chip, Google is rolling out a suite of upgrades meant to make its cloud cheaper, faster, and more flexible, as it vies with larger cloud players Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.In its earnings report last week, Google reported third-quarter cloud revenue of $15.15 billion, a 34% increase from the same period a year earlier. Azure revenue jumped 40%, while Amazon reported 20% growth for AWS. Google said it's signed more billion-dollar cloud deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the previous two years combined.To meet soaring demand, Google upped the high end of its forecast for capital spending this year to $93 billion from $85 billion.\"We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call. \"It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year, and I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that.\"WATCH: Google and Anthropic ink cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollarswatch now",

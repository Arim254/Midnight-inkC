Coke's organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 6%.Shares climbed nearly 3% in premarket trading.The company's unit case volume rose 1%, a reversal from last quarter's decline. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand.But volume in both Latin America and North America, two key markets, was flat for the quarter. Coke executives have previously said that low-income consumers in the U.S. have been buying fewer of its products, although the company is trying to target them with affordable options.Worldwide, Coke saw the largest volume growth from its water, sports, coffee and tea segment. Its bottled water and sports drinks both saw volume increase 3%, while coffee and tea reported volume growth of 2%. The company's sparkling soft drinks volume was flat for the quarter, while its juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverage segment reported that volume shrank 3%.The company reiterated its full-year forecast. Coke is expecting comparable earnings per share to rise 3% and organic revenue to increase 5% to 6%.Looking ahead to 2026, Coke is projecting a slight tailwind to both its revenue and comparable earnings from currency fluctuations. The company will provide a full forecast for the upcoming year in its fourth-quarter earnings report.",

This is a very small sector,\" Cheveley told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"And clearly when you're dealing with a sector so politicized and where government money is being put in essentially as a subsidy, it is telling you that it is difficult to make it work economically,\" he added.Shares of some of Australia's largest critical metals and rare earths companies jumped on Tuesday, while others lost ground after an early rally.Lynas Rare Earths, Australia's largest rare earths producer by market capitalization, fell 7.6% after posting gains earlier in the session. Mineral sand miner Iluka Resources slipped 0.1%, while lithium producer Pilbara Minerals added around 2.6%.Latrobe Magnesium, Australia's primary producer of the critical metal magnesium, notched gains of more than 15%.Stateside, rare earth stocks were last seen slightly lower in premarket. Critical Metals slipped 3.8%, USA Rare Earth fell 2.4%, and MP Materials lost 1.8%.— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng & Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A General Motors Co. Chevrolet Silverado truck at a dealership in Upland, California, US, on Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday after beating Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, while lowering its expected impact from tariffs.Shares of GM swung from down by 2.4% to up by more than 11% during premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock closed Monday at $58 per share.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.31 expectedRevenue: $48.59 billion vs. $45.27 billion expectedAdjusted EBIT: $3.38 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedGM's third-quarter revenue of $48.59 billion was down less than 1% from $48.76 billion in the same period last year.GM's new outlook signals strength for the automaker heading into the fourth quarter and beats Wall Street analysts' current expectations for the last three months of the year.The updated guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, up from $10 billion to $12.5 billion, or $8.25 to $10 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM stock in 2025The automaker's new EPS target suggests a fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of between $1.64 and $2.39, with a midpoint around $2.02, which is above current consensus of $1.94.\"Thanks to the collective efforts of our team, and our compelling vehicle portfolio, GM delivered another very good quarter of earnings and free cash flow,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday in a shareholder letter. \"Based on our performance, we are raising our full-year guidance, underscoring our confidence in the company's trajectory.\"GM also reduced the expected impact of tariffs this year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, down from $4 billion to $5 billion. The automaker expects to offset about 35% of that impact.Barra on Tuesday thanked President Donald Trump for \"the important tariff updates\" Friday that included imposing levies on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts as well as extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.EV impactGM's adjusted results do not include $1.6 billion in special charges reported by the automaker last week due to its pullback in all-electric vehicles, which more than halved its net income attributable to stockholders compared with the third quarter of 2024.The company's net income attributable to stockholders was $1.3 billion during the just-reported period, down 57% from roughly $3.1 billion year earlier. Its net income margin also plummeted to 2.7%, down from 6.3% a year earlier.GM CFO Paul Jacobson on Tuesday said only about 40% of the company's EVs were profitable on a production, or contribution-margin basis. He signaled that the company expects profitability of EVs to take longer than previously expected amid an expected slowdown in adoption.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" he told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box.\"GM has made significant gains in EV sales this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. GM still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla by a wide margin.NA business downGM's North American business, which has driven its profits this decade, earned more than $2.5 billion during the third quarter, on an adjusted basis. Its adjusted profit margin declined from 9.7% a year earlier to 6.2% during the most recent quarter.Barra said in Tuesday's letter that the automaker's \"top priority\" is to return to 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America through \"driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.\"Gains in the company's China operations, up $217 million from a year earlier, as well as its international markets, up $184 million, helped offset the lower North American earnings during the third quarter.GM Financial, the automaker's lending arm, also reported adjusted earnings of $804 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2024.",

The indictment was returned less than a week before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon Web Services, a leader in the cloud infrastructure market, reported a major outage on Monday that took down numerous major websites.Many sites came back online within a few hours, although Downdetector showed another spike in user reports around noon ET of outages at Amazon, AWS and Alexa.The company's latest update at 6:53 p.m. ET noted that \"all AWS services returned to normal operations\" shortly after 6 p.m. ET.Some services continue to have a backlog of messages that will finish processing in the next few hours, AWS said.\"We will share a detailed AWS post-event summary,\" the company said in the note.The update came after outages and delays persisted into Monday afternoon, with the company observing \"increased error rates\" for customers when trying to launch new instances in EC2, its popular cloud service that provides virtual server capacity.\"We are working to fully restore service as quickly as possible,\" the company wrote at the time.Around 1:30 p.m. ET, AWS said it was starting to see \"early signs\" of EC2 recovery in some regions and that it was applying fixes to remaining areas \"at which point we expect launch errors and network connectivity issues to subside.\"Amazon also confirmed that the outage impacted Amazon.com, some of its subsidiaries and AWS customer support operations.The outage was first reported at 3:11 a.m. ET in AWS' main US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications.DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load.AWS cited an \"operational issue\" affecting multiple services and said it was \"working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,\" in an update at 5:01 a.m. ET. More than 70 of its own services were affected.AWS said in an update at 6:35 a.m. ET that the DNS issue had been \"fully mitigated\" and that AWS service operations were \"succeeding normally.\"AWS is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure technology, accounting for around a third of the market, ahead of Microsoft and Google, according to Synergy Research Group. Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS for cloud computing services, such as servers and storage.Read more CNBC tech news$500 purple cables put this little-known company in the middle of the AI boomNearly half of Kalshi's users saw glitches, delays during Saturday college football gamesSalesforce CEO apologizes for saying Trump should send National Guard to San FranciscoProxy advisor ISS recommends Tesla shareholders oppose Musk's $1 trillion pay planMajor companies hitDowndetector showed user reports indicating problems at sites including Disney+, Lyft, the McDonald's app, The New York Times, Reddit, Ring doorbells, Robinhood, Snapchat, United Airlines, T-Mobile and Venmo.British government websites Gov.uk and HM Revenue and Customs were also experiencing issues, per Downdetector.A government spokesperson told CNBC: \"We are aware of an incident affecting Amazon Web Services, and several online services which rely on their infrastructure. Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\"Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that some of its services were affected and asked customers \"to bear with us\" while it worked to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online.The outage also brought down critical tools inside Amazon. Warehouse and delivery employees, along with drivers for Amazon's Flex service, reported on Reddit that internal systems were offline at many sites. Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately.Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage.Reddit, too, is \"working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,\" a spokesperson told CNBC.Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.A T-Mobile spokesperson said its customers had issues when trying to use other sites or services due to the AWS disruption, but that there \"was no outage or service disruption\" at the carrier.Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the \"ongoing AWS incident.\"Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.Graphic design tool Canva said it was \"experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.\"Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. \"The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it,\" CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a post on X.Centralized softwareIt's not the first time in recent history that major companies have been affected by a technical issue. In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill.Amazon, Microsoft and Google have long jockeyed to claim enterprise customers. After an outage of Microsoft's suite of productivity software earlier this month, Google sought to capitalize on the service lapse by pitching its own tools and a business continuity plan that runs its Workspace service in parallel with Microsoft 365.In a blog post last week, Google wrote, \"Just because Microsoft 365 goes down -- and it's a question of when and for how long, not if -- doesn't mean that your teams need to go back to using pen and paper.\"Google's cloud services went down for an extended period in June, disrupting several major service providers like OpenAI and Shopify. The company said the outage was caused by multiple layers of flawed recent updates.Monday's AWS outage doesn't appear to have been caused by a cyberattack, but is more likely a \"technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,\" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement.\"These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly,\" he added.An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment.Indeed, \"DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,\" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it \"is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.\"\"We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,\" he added.\"This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.\"— CNBC's Leslie Josephs and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that there was no service disruption at T-Mobile.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, and Anthony Albanese, Australia's prime minister, shake hands outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of some of Australia's largest critical metals and rare earths companies surged on Tuesday morning, following the announcement of a massive minerals deal between Washington and Canberra worth up to $8.5 billion, before many later pared gains.The agreement — signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday — includes funding for multiple projects aimed at boosting the supply of key materials used in defense manufacturing and energy security.Lynas Rare Earths, Australia's largest rare earths producer by market capitalization, fell 7.6% after an early rally. Mineral sand miner Iluka Resources slipped 0.1%, while lithium producer Pilbara Minerals added around 2.6%.Other smaller rare earth miners fared better, with VHM ending the day up 20%, Northern Minerals popped over 1.9% and Latrobe Magnesium, Australia's primary producer of the critical metal magnesium, climbing over 15.4%. NYSE-listed Alcoa, which is developing a project in Western Australia to recover and refine the critical metal gallium, was named as one of the two priority projects under the new minerals deal. Washington will make an equity investment in the initiative, sending Alcoa shares — also traded in Sydney through depositary receipts — ending the trading session up 7.5%.Rare earths and critical metals are essential for high-tech products such as electric vehicles, semiconductors and defense equipment. China, the global leader in the production of rare earths and many other critical minerals, has tightened export controls on the materials amid a trade war with the U.S., accelerating international efforts to diversify global supply chains. Albanese said the two countries will each contribute $1 billion over the next six months for projects that are \"immediately available.\"However, a White House fact sheet later stated that Washington and Canberra will invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the same period, describing the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, potentially unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.Australia and the U.S. will also work to adopt a \"pricing framework\" for rare earths — potentially including price floors — to stabilize global markets and offset years of price volatility.One of the biggest threats to U.S. mineral security is China's strategy of flooding the market with excess supply, which has driven prices so low that mines in the U.S. and Australia become unviable, according to a report released Monday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Washington-based think tank described Australia as the U.S.'s \"most important partner in countering China's dominance in rare earths,\" noting it attracted $64 million in exploration investment last year, about 45% of the global total, making it the world's top destination for rare earth exploration in 2024.",

    "body": "Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Sanae Takaichi stands up and bows to acknowledge the applause after she was selected as Japan's new prime minister during an extraordinary session of the lower house of parliament in Tokyo on October 21, 2025. Philip Fong | Afp | Getty ImagesSanae Takaichi on Tuesday created history, winning Japan's parliamentary vote to become the country's first woman prime minister.Takaichi garnered 237 votes in the first round of voting, negating the need for a runoff vote in the 465-seat Lower House, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her victory comes after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party allied with the Japan Innovation Party and reportedly signed an agreement over the weekend to form a coalition government. Takaichi agreed to back JIP policies such as a reduction in parliamentary seats, free high school education and a two-year pause on food consumption tax, according to Reuters.Tobias Harris, founder and principal at risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that the JIP might not want to take up a cabinet post, saying that \"there's a real risk joining a coalition with an LDP that is still seeing historically low approval ratings, [and] does not really have the trust of the public.\"Domestic Japanese media has also reported that the JIP is not looking at cabinet positions in the new administration, and will instead support the government from the outside.Should the JIP not like the LDP's approach, it will be easier for them to exit the coalition, Harris said.In the Ishiba administration, the LDP suffered heavy electoral losses, losing its majority in both the upper and the lower house.Japan's Nikkei 225, which had risen 1.5% earlier during the day, erased its gains, while the benchmark 10-year government bond yields dipped 1.6 basis points to 1.654%. The yen weakened 0.33% to 151.25.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPath to PMTakaichi's path to the country's top job has been challenging.In the 2024 LDP presidential race, Takaichi lost to Shigeru Ishiba. She won the leadership of the party in September this year, defeating Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi after Ishiba announced his resignation.But on Oct. 10, the Komeito party abruptly exited its alliance with the LDP, ending a relationship going back to 1999, putting Takaichi's fate in a limbo.A hardline conservative, Takaichi has been widely labeled as an apostle of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.She had previously criticized the Bank of Japan's plan to raise interest rates during the 2024 LDP leadership race, although BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said that the central bank would set rates \"without any preconceptions.\"On the geopolitical front, Takaichi has called for a hardline stance toward China and is also in favor of revising Japan's pacifist constitution.Her previous visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war criminals, have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, which see the site as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime aggression.Takaichi is going to be \"very, very careful\" in how she communicates her views, especially on foreign policy,\" said Kei Okamura, managing director and portfolio manager of Neuberger Berman, told CNBC earlier this month.\"Her views on China and Korea have also been very well flagged. But she also understands that she has to maintain very good relations with all these countries, especially also with the United States, just because all of them have a very big impact in terms of Japan's biggest export destinations.\"",

    "body": "Working for (or with) someone who scrutinizes everything you do and demands that you run it past them for approval can push anyone to the brink. But don't despair. I'm the author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need From the People in Charge,\" a human behavior professor, and an executive coach who's spent the last 15 years coaching leaders at Google, Amazon, and other Fortune 500 companies.I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be for people to navigate the challenges of working with a control freak. I teach them some simple strategies to make the situation work in their favor — without leaving them exhausted and frustrated every day.If you also work for a controlling and impatient taskmaster, try these five steps:1. Run with rough draftsRather than toiling away for days — or weeks — to craft the perfect deliverable, do a first pass and say, \"Here's what I've put together so far. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I wanted to capture the core ideas and structure so we can shape it into something outstanding.\" Your boss will be happy to have input, and you'll conserve your energy.2. Reinforce their authorityUse phrases like, \"What we ultimately do is up to you,\" or, \"I'll share my two cents so that you can make the final decision.\" This allows you to emphasize you know who's the boss. Pose your ideas as inquiries. Try, \"What if…\" or, \"How about we…\" Asking questions in conversation boosts feelings of control in the other person, which is called the question-behavior effect in psychology. 3. OvershareSend a breakdown of items you plan to tackle each week every Monday or shoot over a quick heads-up if you'll be late to a meeting. While sometimes tedious, sharing this information will satiate your boss's desire for oversight, while saving you the effort of justifying yourself later. You might share your update with: \"To keep you in the loop about our progress, I've prepped a weekly status memo with a snapshot of recent developments.\" Or say: \"I'm confirming that we're moving ahead with [X]. Let me know by Friday if there are any changes.\"4. Get ahead of their criticismYou might say, \"I'm planning to approach [X task] this way. Do you have initial thoughts?\" When your boss corrects you, use the classic \"yes, and…\" improv technique. Acknowledge their input (\"yes\") and then add your perspective or suggestion (\"and\") to subtly assert your ideas while taking their feedback into account. It might sound like this: \"Yes, I appreciate the need to be more concise in my emails, and I believe a brief context section is still beneficial for clarity, especially for people less familiar with the project.\"5. Ask for the praise you needTry emphasizing the significance of their approval: \"I enjoy hearing how I can improve. It's also important for me to know what's going well so I can do more of that. Is there room for you to share your perspective on what I'm getting right, or do you prefer to keep the focus on what needs adjusting?\"Melody Wilding, LMSW is an executive coach, human behavior professor, and author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.\" Get her free training, 5 Steps to Speak Like a Senior Leader, here. Want to catch up on our CNBC Make It Book Club discussion with Melody Wilding?

    "body": "Dario Amodei, Anthropic CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCAnthropic on Monday announced Claude for Life Sciences, a new offering for researchers to use the company's artificial intelligence technology in the advancement of scientific discovery. Claude for Life Sciences is built around Anthropic's existing AI models, but supports new connections with other scientific tools that are commonly used in labs during research and development.It will be able to help researchers through all stages of the discovery process, from carrying out literature reviews to developing hypotheses, analyzing data, drafting regulatory submissions and more, Anthropic said.The launch of Claude for Life Sciences marks Anthropic's first formal entry into the sector, and comes just months after the company hired longtime industry executive Eric Kauderer-Abrams as its head of biology and life sciences. \"Now is the threshold moment for us where we've decided this is a big investment area,\" Kauderer-Abrams told CNBC in an interview. \"We want a meaningful percentage of all of the life science work in the world to run on Claude, in the same way that that happens today with coding.\"Read more CNBC tech news$500 purple cables put this little-known company in the middle of the AI boomNearly half of Kalshi's users saw glitches, delays during Saturday college football gamesSalesforce CEO apologizes for saying Trump should send National Guard to San FranciscoProxy advisor ISS recommends Tesla shareholders oppose Musk's $1 trillion pay planAnthropic, which is one of the companies at the center of the AI boom, develops a family of large language models called Claude. It was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years.The company launched a new model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, late last month and said it is \"significantly better\" at life sciences tasks like understanding laboratory protocols.  Kauderer-Abrams said researchers have already been engaging with Anthropic's models to help with isolated parts of the scientific process, so the company decided to formally build out Claude for Life Sciences as a way to support them from start to finish. That meant Anthropic had to establish integrations with key players in the life sciences ecosystem, including Benchling, PubMed, 10x Genomics and Synapse.org, among others. Anthropic has also partnered with companies that can help life sciences organizations adopt AI, like Caylent, KPMG, Deloitte, and cloud providers AWS and Google Cloud, the company said.\"We're willing and enthusiastic about doing that grind to make sure that all the pieces come together,\" Kauderer-Abrams said.In a prerecorded demo, Anthropic showed how a scientist working on preclinical studies could use Claude for Life Sciences to compare two study designs that test different dosing strategies. The scientist was able to query her lab's data directly from Benchling, generate a summary and tables of key differences with links back to the original material. After reviewing the results, the scientist generated a study report that could be included in a regulatory submission. Anthropic said an analysis like this used to require \"days\" of validating and compiling information, but now, it can be done in minutes. Kauderer-Abrams said the company believes AI can bring about real efficiency gains for the life sciences sector, but it's also under \"no illusions\" that it will magically overcome the physical limitations of conducting scientific research. Clinical trials that take three years are not suddenly going to take one month, he said.Instead, Anthropic is focused on exploring the time-consuming, expensive parts of the discovery process \"piece by piece\" to determine where AI could be most useful.\"We're here to make sure that this transformation happens and that it's done responsibly,\" Kauderer-Abrams said.WATCH: Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI modelwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowTop White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett on Monday predicted the government shutdown is \"likely to end sometime this week.\"But if that does not happen, the Trump administration may impose \"stronger measures\" to force Democrats to cooperate, Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"The comments came deep into the third week of the shutdown, which is dragging on with no clear end in sight amid a partisan fight in the Senate over federal funding priorities.Republicans want to pass a short-term resolution to resume funding at current levels. Democrats demand that any stopgap bill include additional spending on health-care protections, including an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are due to expire at year's end.The GOP-backed bill failed to pass the Senate for the 11th time on Monday evening. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines.watch nowHassett said on CNBC that he has heard from the Senate that Democrats thought it would be \"bad optics\" to vote to reopen the government before this weekend's massive nationwide \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump.\"Now there's a shot that this week, things will come together, and very quickly,\" Hassett said. \"The moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government, at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

But with numerous polls showing more voters blame Trump and Republicans for the impasse — and indicating strong support for extending the ACA health insurance subsidies — Democrats mostly haven't budged.\"Every day gets better for us,\" Schumer told Punchbowl News earlier this month, \"because we've thought about this long in advance and we knew that health care would be the focal point on Sept. 30 and we prepared for it.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare tax credits in exchange for opening the government.But top Democrats appear to be rejecting Thune's entreaty. Instead, some Democrats are calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.Hassett said Monday that Trump \"has been very active throughout this process, but it's also his position that this is a thing that the Senate needs to work out.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 17, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a shift in support toward Russia's Vladimir Putin as he looks for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, likely striking fear into Ukrainian officials.Trump held a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the potential supply of U.S. long-range cruise missiles, Tomahawks, on the agenda.Zelenskyy walked away from the meeting not only empty-handed, but apparently upbraided by Trump, who said Ukraine should accept Russia's terms for ending the war — by handing over the entire eastern territory of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters this weekend, Trump said for Donbas to be \"cut the way it is.\"\"It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,\" he said on Air Force One on Sunday. \"They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done.\"In the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also warned the Ukrainian leader that Putin had told him — in a lengthy phone call on Thursday in which they agreed to hold in-person talks in Hungary — that Russia would \"destroy\" Ukraine if it did not agree to the demand.The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy descended into a \"shouting match,\" the Financial Times reported, with Trump \"cursing all the time,\" according to unnamed people familiar with the matter cited by the FT.In a Truth Social post, Trump described the meeting as \"very interesting, and cordial,\" but said he had \"strongly suggested\" to both leaders that it was time to end the war.\"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he said in the post Friday.watch nowZelenskyy put on a brave face, telling NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" in an interview recorded Friday after the meeting with Trump, that \"we are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning.\" He also remained optimistic despite leaving the White House without the Tomahawk missiles he was coveting.\"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" Zelenskyy told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in the interview, which aired Sunday.He also said he was ready to join Putin and Trump's upcoming summit in Budapest, which could take place in the next few weeks. Whether Zelenskyy will be invited to Hungary remains to be seen, however.As well as declining to provide Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, which Trump had previously mooted in an apparent bid to bring Russia to the negotiating table, Trump also mused about giving security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the talks.The White House declined to comment further to CNBC on Monday.As for Moscow, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told CNBC on Monday in emailed comments that the Kremlin welcomes \"Trump's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Ukraine.\"US President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on October 17, 2025. Tom Brenner | Afp | Getty ImagesIs Trump ready to pressure Putin?Close followers of Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy relations fear the U.S. president is easily swayed by the veteran Russian leader's arguments over Ukraine. They say Trump does not appear ready or willing to exert more pressure on Putin, be it in the form of more arms transfers to Kyiv, or more economic restrictions on Russia.\"We keep dismissing Donald Trump as kind of 'Everybody's Fool' because he's so bombastic and says many things a mile a minute, but he actually is being very transactional about the relationship,\" Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at The New School, told CNBC \"Squawk Box\" on Friday.\"Everybody keeps pulling him one side or another, be it the Russian side or Ukrainian side. But he's not taking sides, and he's really playing, interestingly, both hands.\"She noted that Trump still wants to win over Putin, but is also keeping him on a \"tight leash,\" demonstrated by his threat to give Ukraine more weapons.\"So far, I think it is working. He's not giving either side what they wanted, but he keeps going, and eventually, potentially, they may agree to some sort of a peace agreement,\" she said.Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC that Putin is likely to wait Trump out.\"I think it would be more effective [for Trump] to combine the military threat with greater economic pressure, but we'll see maybe that comes later,\" he noted Friday.watch nowO'Hanlon said there were several ways the U.S. could ramp up the pressure on Moscow, including another U.S. aid package for Ukraine and a bigger crackdown on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of tankers facilitating shipments of Russian crude to circumvent the oil price cap and sanctions.\"We don't do much trading with Russia, but, of course, other countries do, and I think it's time to talk to not just India, but also China about a strategy whereby they would consider reducing their interaction, their economic interaction, and you threaten secondary sanctions if you don't get that kind of help,\" he said.\"So those are the different pieces. Not all of them have to happen at the exact same minute, and they can happen. They can be phased in, but I think President Trump is a little too fixated on just the Tomahawks, plus his personal rapport with Putin, and I don't think that's going to be enough [to stop Russia].\"",

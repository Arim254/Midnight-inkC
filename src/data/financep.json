    "body": "Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Digital Ltd., exits a Correctional Services Department vehicle as he arrives at the Court of Final Appeal for the verdict of his bail hearing in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. Prosecutors in Hong Kong charged Lai, a prominent critic of Beijing and local authorities, last year under the national security law imposed by Beijing, saying he had colluded with foreigners by calling for sanctions against China. Photographer: Chan Long Hei/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHong Kong pro-democracy activist and media baron Jimmy Lai on Monday was found guilty of sedition and collusion with foreign countries by a Hong Kong court.The 78-year-old was charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, enacted by Beijing in 2020 after pro-democracy protests swept the region in 2019. The court said Lai was guilty of a \"conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.\" It also said that Lai and his tabloid Apple Daily, requested a foreign country or entity outside of China \"to impose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities\" against Hong Kong or China. The court, in its 850-page judgement, said that the businessman \"harbored his resentment and hatred of the PRC [People's Republic of China] for many of his adult years.\"  Lai, one of the CCP's most vocal critics, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials. He has been under arrest since 2020, with his trial starting in December 2023. Lai's sentencing is expected to be on Jan. 12.Speaking just after the judgment, Andrew Collier, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the verdict was \"not very good\" from a foreign investor perspective, adding \"people want an independent court system that's going to protect the rights of citizens and the financial community.\"He said the verdict on Lai was expected, but the question for Hong Kong is around investor confidence. While the city has seen a growing number of IPOs in 2025, \"if investors are not comfortable with the court system, with cases like Jimmy Lai's, that's not good for the future of Hong Kong,\" Collier said. Lai, who founded Asian clothing brand Giordano, newspaper Apple Daily and digital media company Next Digital, was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea back in October. Trump pressed Xi to release Lai during the meeting, according to Reuters. The court said that Lai's \"only intent\" was to seek the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party, adding \"even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the PRC and the HKSAR [Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China]. This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications.\" Speaking to CNBC before the verdict, veteran investor David Roche suggested that a lenient approach could be good for Hong Kong's business climate. \"That, I think, would help to give the overriding impression and therefore conviction to people in the money business that Hong Kong had returned to its normal, business driven, dynamic self.\" Lai acquired British citizenship before Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. The trial verdict is the latest development in Hong Kong's political scene, which has seen the erosion of democratic opposition in one of Asia's financial hubs since the enactment of the national security law. Under changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in 2021, the number of directly elected members in the city's legislature was drastically slashed, with only \"patriots\" reviewed by an election committee allowed to stand for elections.  Monday's verdict comes on the heels of the dissolution of Hong Kong's last pro-democracy party on Sunday after 31 years, as well as a \"patriots-only\" legislative election that saw the second lowest turnout in the region's history. In a response to CNBC, Kenneth Roth, visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and a former director at Human Rights Watch, said that the decision \"underscores the utter demise of the political freedoms that had once made the city so great.\"",

    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident. Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted. \"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch,\" Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday. He stressed \"everything in moderation\" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter. Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.\"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children,\" Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a \"paramount responsibility\" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform. He said his goal is  \"to make it easy for all parents\" to manage their children's YouTube use \"in a way that is suitable to their household,\" especially as every parent has a different approach. Bill Gates, Mark Cuban Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform. \"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it,\" Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. \"I think too much of anything is not a good thing.\"Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens. \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier,\" Gates said years ago. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.",

    "body": "19 November 2025, China, Shanghai: Boats sail past downtown Shanghai on the Huangpu River. The tallest building on the skyline is the Shanghai Tower (rear). Bernd von Jutrczenka | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesChina's economic slowdown deepened in November with consumption, investment and industrial output growth falling short of expectations, as authorities sought to curb supply while struggling to revive demand and arrest the property sector decline.  Retail sales rose 1.3% last month from a year earlier, sharply missing Reuters' median forecast for a 2.8% growth, and slowing from 2.9% rise in the prior month. Industrial production climbed 4.8% in November from a year ago, missing expectations for a 5% jump and marking its weakest growth since August 2024. Investment in fixed assets, which includes property, contracted 2.6% over the January through November period compared with a year earlier, sharper than the 2.3% drop estimated by economists. That decline deepened from the 1.7% in the January to October period, and was the sharpest slump seen since the pandemic outbreak in 2020, according to data from Wind Information going back to 1992. \"The contraction of fixed asset investment and the drop in property prices in recent months have been transmitted to the consumer sentiment,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint asset management, said in a note following the data, expecting more supportive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in the first quarter next year.   Investment in real estate dropped 15.9% in the first 11 months this year, steeper than the 10.3% drop seen in the January to October period, as the property slump drags on. In another sign that the sector downturn is still searching for a bottom, the declines in home prices across 70 major cities steepened in November. New home prices fell 1.2% in tier-1 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen while resale home prices dropped 5.8% from a year earlier.  Meanwhile, economists at Golman Sachs in a preview last week pointed to the falling auto sales as a major drag on overall retail sales, coupled with the \"negative distortion\" effect from the earlier-than-usual start of the Singles-Day online shopping festival that pulled forward demand from November to October.  Data from China Automobile Dealers Association showed auto retail sales by volume in November declined for the first time in three years, dropping 8.1% from a year earlier to 2.23 million cars, as many local governments paused the trade-in subsidies.  Several online shopping sites extended their promotional period in a bid to jolt consumer spending, running from the first half of October through to Nov. 11, making it the longest Singles' Day sales period ever. But still, sales performance disappointed as consumers tightened their purse strings, with gross merchandise volume growing just 12%, compared to 20% growth last year, according to data from Syntun.  Call for rebalancingChinese policymakers have pledged further policy support to drive domestic demand and boost consumption and investment for next year. The finance ministry said in a statement Saturday that it planned to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds next year to fund projects bolstering national security. The proceeds will also be directed toward equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs. The ministry also pledged to boost its budget for investment to ease the slump in fixed-asset investment in recent months. However analysts appeared to be less optimistic as Beijing has yet to put any meaningful stimulus measures on the table.  \"Even though we're seeing targeted policy support in place, it is hard to generate a meaningful pickup in consumption without clearer improvement in job prospects and wage growth,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at asset management firm eToro. Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University and senior fellow at Brookings Institute, expressed concerns over the sustainability of China's economic growth. In an opinion piece published on Sunday, the economist urged structural reforms to rebalance the economy, including measures to support labour market, strengthen social safety net and bolster private enterprises.   \"The government clearly wants to rebalance growth and understands what's needed to bolster household consumption and raise productivity. Yet there is little sense of urgency and no clear timeline on concrete policy measures to accomplish these objectives,\" Prasad noted.  The urban unemployment rate in November came in at 5.1%, unchanged from the prior month. Youth unemployment has been more concerning, with the latest reading for October standing at 17.3%.    Still, China's economy appears to be on track to meet the official growth target of \"around 5%,\" thanks to a surge in exports to non-U.S. markets even as tariff tensions with Washington have weighed on shipments to the world's largest consumer market.China's trade surplus surged to a record $1.1 trillion in November, breaking its full-year record of $992.2 billion in 2024, in just 11 months, drawing widespread concerns over its reliance on foreign demand and depreciation of its currency to keep exports competitive. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last week called on China to \"accelerate\" support for domestic consumption and shift away from relying on exports for growth. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, cautioned that appreciating renminbi, or yuan, to reduce trade surplus was unlikely to be sustainable without meaningful steps to end deflation in the economy.The trade-weighted renminbi's value against a basket of currencies, rather than solely against the U.S. dollar, has appreciated by 3% from 2021 to 2025, a period when China's exports surged by 44.8%, according to Lu's estimates. \"If there is a slowdown in growth and worsening deflation, markets may again take a bearish view on RMB, leading to depreciation against USD and its basket,\" Lu noted.The offshore yuan has strengthened over 3% this year to 7.0496 per dollar on Monday, its strongest level since October last year, according to LSEG data.       \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

The IPO markets remain choppy and many startups are choosing to remain private for longer instead of risking a muted debut on the public markets. Founded in 2016, Armis said in August it had surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues, a milestone it achieved less than a year after reaching $200 million in ARR.Its latest funding round was led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet.

    "body": "Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The excuses feel valid: \"We're exhausted,\" or, \"We'll catch up this weekend.\" The problem is that they both end up missing the everyday moments that keep a relationship alive.As a psychologist who studies couples and as a husband, I've found that people in the happiest, most resilient relationships treat their weeknights as opportunities that don't go wasted.Here are the seven things these couples consistently do before bedtime.1. They start with decompression timeYou can't always expect your partner to walk through the door ready to cook, talk, or be cheerful. Healthy couples build in 15 to 30 minutes of guilt-free alone time for each partner — one decompresses while the other handles a light task, then they switch.It's not glamorous, but it's a huge kindness. By protecting each other's battery early in the evening, they preserve the bandwidth they'll need to connect later on.2. They 'silent sync' when they're drainedSome nights, even after a decompression session, you may still feel drained. Happy couples don't force it. They start their evening together, but quietly: sitting on the balcony, lying side by side, taking a slow walk.In psychological research, this is a form of co-regulation: the process of two people syncing up emotionally, allowing the emotions of the day to rise and fall until they feel like themselves again. A few minutes of shared quiet can reset your rhythm better than a forced conversation.3. They do a quick daily recapNot every weeknight has room for deep emotional check-ins. So the happiest couples keep it simple: each person shares one thing about their day, good or bad. It could be venting some frustration, sharing a little win they had at the office or even just something funny that happened. No advice. No solutions. Just listening. This light, consistent sharing keeps them emotionally updated without draining what's left of their workweek energy.4. They keep one honored ritual, no matter whatEven on nights when both partners want to zone out, they stick to one small shared ritual they never skip. For most, it's something ridiculously simple: eating dinner together without their phones, making a nightly cup of tea, or doing a word game together. The ritual becomes a daily anchor — something predictable, comforting, and theirs alone.5. They cuddle before sleepIf I had to choose just one nightly habit to keep, this would be it. Research shows that partners who cuddle regularly report higher relationship satisfaction and commitment, even compared with couples who emphasize \"quality time\" together.Cuddling triggers oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). It's the easiest, fastest biological boost your relationship can get.6. They 'close the kitchen' as a teamEven the happiest couples feel the low-level resentment of uneven household work. That's why they end the evening with 5 to 10 minutes of shared tidying, wiping counters, packing tomorrow's lunches, loading the dishwasher.The point isn't actually about cleaning, but rather to prove that they're committed to keeping things fair.7. They check in about tomorrowInstead of rehashing the day, heathy and happy couples look ahead. They share one small thing they're looking forward to tomorrow, or even one small thing they're dreading.This is a brief, gentle way for working couples to stay in sync without needing to fully rehash the emotional weight of their day. You get a sense of what your partner might need tomorrow, whether it's encouragement, space, or just a little extra support. And they get the same from you.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships. He holds degrees from Cornell University and the University of Colorado Boulder.

Index heavyweights memory chipmaker SK Hynix was down over 4%, while Samsung Electronics declined 3.3%.Japan announced its fourth-quarter Tankan numbers. The index for business optimism among large Japanese manufacturers increased to +15 for the fourth quarter, hitting the highest level in four years. The latest reading compared  to the +14 increase in the previous quarter, and matched expectations of economists polled by Reuters. The non-manufacturing index for the fourth quarter came in at +34.The Tankan survey, conducted by the Bank of Japan, measures business sentiment among companies in the world's fourth largest economy. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.66%. On Sunday, the country suffered its worst gun attack in over 30 years that left at least 15 dead.Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 1.3%, while the Topix declined 0.27%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.79%, while the mainland CSI 300 was flat, after a slew of key economic data out of China. Retail sales rose 1.3% last month from a year earlier, sharply missing Reuters' median forecast for a 2.8% growth, and slowing from the 2.9% rise in the prior month. Industrial production climbed 4.8% in November from a year ago, down from 4.9% in the prior month and missing expectations for a 5% increase.",

    "body": "Today, Dick Van Dyke is officially 100 years old. Born on Dec. 13, 1925, the \"Mary Poppins\" actor took Hollywood by storm with his singing and dancing, and became an Emmy, Grammy and Tony award-winning legend. Now, Van Dyke has earned a new title: centenarian. Over the course of his life, the performer has shared the practices he follows to stay in the best of health.\"When you reach 100, a lot of things don't work too well,\" Van Dyke told The New York Times last month. But \"sometimes I feel like I'm 15 again.\"In his recent book, \"100 Rules for Living to 100: An Optimist's Guide to a Happy Life,\" published last month, Van Dyke explores his secrets for longevity even further. Here are three research-backed staples in his routine that he credits for his 100 years of life. How Dick Van Dyke stays active at 100, and his tips for a long, healthy life1. He moves his body oftenEven at 100, Van Dyke goes to the gym three times a week, he told the New York Times. When he makes his way to each machine, sometimes he dances as he walks, he said.On his off days from the gym, he practices yoga and stretches. Van Dyke said his doctors are amazed at how he's still able to touch his toes.Similar to Van Dyke, many Japanese centenarians — particularly in the blue zone, Okinawa, Japan — start their mornings with exercise. Typically they do a low-intensity workout that airs on the radio, called radio taiso, which is about three minutes long. The exercise also promotes a sense of community because participants tend to practice it alongside friends, colleagues or family.2. He has an optimistic outlook and doesn't turn down opportunities that excite him\"I've decided people are born with a certain personality and a certain outlook, a certain perspective,\" Van Dyke said in a sit-down interview with Al Roker for the TODAY show this November. \"I tend to look on the good side of things.\"Keeping a sense of playfulness in his life helps him experience a lot more fun, he said in his interview with The New York Times. Just last year, Van Dyke starred in Coldplay's music video for the song \"All My Love.\"In the Directors' Cut version of the video, Van Dyke spoke about how his career aligned with his desire to remain a kid at heart. He said he's \"one of those lucky people who got to do for a living what I would have done anyway.\"Often, the happiest centenarians pursue jobs that are fulfilling to them and don't retire. \"Think how lucky I am,\" he said. \"I got to do what I do — play and act silly.\"3. He values quality time with loved onesTowards the end of the \"All My Love\" music video, Van Dyke welcomes his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren into frame to dance with him. The scene is a symbol of just how much he treasures spending time with his loved ones.Van Dyke is always looking for ways to get his grandchildren and great-grandchildren to enjoy their time at his house, so they want to come back and visit, he told The New York Times. He wants his backyard to resemble a theme park, and mentioned that he's planning to add a zip line next.\"Just hearing them all out there squealing gives me such joy,\" Van Dyke said.A decades-long study conducted by researchers at Harvard found that the key to happiness and longevity is social fitness, or maintaining healthy, long-lasting interpersonal connections.As far as his plans for his birthday today, Van Dyke's itinerary is very relaxed when squared with the major accomplishment of turning 100. Still, it aligns with spending quality time.\"He doesn't want to do anything,\" his wife Arlene Silver told People last week. \"He wants to be in his room watching Jeopardy! reruns with me.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

    "body": "From how much energy you have first thing in the morning, to how your mood ebbs and flows throughout the day, the foods you eat have a significant impact on how you feel. It's why doctors and nutritionists alike consider the first meal of the day to be most important. Hunter Stoler, a NYC-based certified nutrition and health coach, has a go-to breakfast that he eats just about every day to feel his best. Known as \"Health with Hunter\" on social media, the 25-year-old also recommends this breakfast to his more than 400,000 followers on Instagram and 300,000+ followers on TikTok. \"I'll say six out of every seven days a week, I have a yogurt bowl just because I know it's balanced,\" Stoler tells CNBC Make It.His yogurt bowl recipe is high in fiber and protein.\"It sets me up for success, it makes me feel good and I'm full for a few hours after that,\" he says.The breakfast allows him to up his fiber intake, which, research shows, many people often lack in their diets. Less than 10% of U.S. adults get the recommended daily intake of fiber, according to a study which was presented at Nutrition 2021 Live Online.Here are the key ingredients in Stoler's daily yogurt bowl. Plus, some of his other healthy breakfast options.Health with Hunter's go-to high-fiber, high-protein breakfastJust about every morning, Stoler mixes together these five ingredients:Non-fat Greek yogurtHalf a serving of protein powderFrozen organic wild blueberriesHealthy cereal or granolaSpices (cinnamon, pumpkin spice or a pinch of salt)\"There's flexibility in that, but the structure of the meal is the same,\" Stoler says. \"That combination of protein from the protein powder and Greek yogurt, fiber from the blueberries, and potentially a little bit from the cereal or granola, is what's going to keep me really full and just satisfied.\"Research shows that the antioxidants found in blueberries can help reduce inflammation, improve your brain health and lead to more positive health outcomes.The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility.Hunter StolerNutrition and health coachOne of Stoler's other go-to morning meals that's high in fiber and protein is overnight oatmeal. He mixes together almond milk or whole milk with a cup of glyphosate-free oats and a scoop of protein powder. He stores it in his fridge until the following day.\"Then the next morning, you have delicious oats that you could top with fruit, a nut butter, which is really great, cinnamon and maybe a little bit of Greek yogurt for more protein,\" Stoler says.If he's craving a warm, healthy breakfast, he toasts high-fiber bread and tops it with savory foods like scrambled eggs and avocado, or yogurt for a sweet option. \"The opportunities are endless, but remember, it's about the structure with flexibility,\" he says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has unveiled the final tally for her 2025 charitable donations, which totaled $7.17 billion in gifts to roughly 225 organizations, she wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday.\"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year,\" Scott wrote.Scott's 2025 giving brings her total donation amount since 2019 to $26.3 billion, based on her past public announcements of her charitable giving. This year's donations went to a wide range of nonprofits including several historically Black colleges and universities, and organizations focused on issues including poverty, social injustice and climate change.Scott's updated philanthropic tally puts her behind only fellow billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in terms of lifetime giving, according to Forbes. Forbes still estimates a $29.9 billion net worth for Scott, who became one of the world's wealthiest women following her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyFollowing her divorce, Scott signed The Giving Pledge, committing to giving away the bulk of her wealth in her lifetime. She tasked a team of advisors with helping her step up her philanthropic giving by identifying \"organizations with strong leadership teams and results\" across a wide range of areas of societal need, she wrote in a 2020 blog post.Specifically, she wanted to pay \"special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates and low access to philanthropic capital,\" she wrote.In her Tuesday essay, Scott wrote about putting her giving into perspective, citing data from Giving USA, which reported in June that Americans donated more than $590 billion in charitable giving in 2024. Much of the country's philanthropy — whether monetary or otherwise — happens on a relatively small scale, Scott wrote.\"Over 70% of Americans reported giving both labor and money to people they know, and half reported doing the same for strangers,\" wrote Scott, adding: \"It's easy to focus on the methods of civic participation that make news, and hard to imagine the importance of the things we do each day with our own minds and hearts.\"Scott mentioned multiple examples of generosity she received before she became wealthy, helping inspire her more recent philanthropy. She wrote about a \"local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college,\" and her college roommate at Princeton University \"who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.\"That roommate, Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, went on to found Funding U, a student lender that offers loans to low-income students without requiring a co-signer, Scott noted.Scott highlighted those examples while encouraging civic participation in myriad forms, from financial gifts to random acts of kindness: \"Respect, understanding, insight, empathy, forgiveness, inspiration – all of these are meaningful contributions to others.\"Scott's blog post did not break down how or why she chose any of the hundreds of organizations she supported in 2025. A long-standing aspect of her giving does stand out in contrast to many other billionaire philanthropists: Her donations typically come without any strings, meaning organizations are free to use the money however they see fit.Her goal has been to \"de-emphasize privileged voices\" like her own, \"and cede focus to others,\" she wrote in a 2021 blog post.\"People struggling against inequities deserve center stage in stories about change they are creating,\" Scott wrote in that post. \"This is equally — perhaps especially — true when their work is funded by wealth.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

Cross | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrediction markets swung sharply Friday after President Donald Trump said Kevin Warsh has risen to the top of his list to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.On Kalshi, Warsh's odds jumped to as high as 40% from about 15% after Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Warsh is a top contender. Meanwhile, the implied probability of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett becoming the next Fed chair dropped below 60% briefly from 80% not long ago.Asked directly whether Warsh was now his leading choice, Trump responded, \"Yes, I think he is,\" according to the paper. The comments quickly reverberated through prediction markets.Trump did imply that Hassett is still very much in the running as well and the NEC director is still leading the race on Kalshi.\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump said.Hassett had been the clear market favorite for months, but by Friday afternoon his odds dipped as investors priced in Trump's latest signal.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post. Kalshi has essentially eliminated their chances for getting the top job.Trump also on Friday reiterated his long-held view that the Fed chair should consult the president on rate policy. Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, as he continued to urge for lower interest rates. The Fed has reduced the fed funds rates by three-quarters of a percentage point since September.",

They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 59 prior information technology companies and their average return on these situations is 36.92% versus an average of 20.01% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Additionally, Starboard has taken a total of 163 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.26% versus 14.34% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Dec. 9, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Clearwater Analytics and is urging the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers.Behind the scenesClearwater Analytics is a provider of front-to-back, cloud-based investment accounting solutions. The company has steadily taken share from legacy solutions, such as BlackRock, State Street and SS&C, as they are widely viewed as the premium modern platform. In 2016, private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe became the majority investor in the company. In 2020, Warburg Pincus and Permira made minority investments, and, about a year later, these three firms took the company public at $18 per share. Clearwater performed fairly well from its IPO through 2024, supported by consistent growth and historically strong margins that drove a premium valuation relative to peers, and these sponsors were rewarded accordingly. Warburg and Permira, which owned 22%, each sold their positions entirely and WCAS, which owned 56%, reduced its stake to roughly 1% by November 2024, at prices as high as $29.11 per share.Shortly thereafter, the company started making a string of acquisitions — a public company, Enfusion, and two private businesses, Beacon and Bistro. All of these transactions were announced between January and March of this year and closed within the following few months. The consequence of this is that Clearwater shifted from being a clean high-growth vertical software story with strong margins, a premium valuation, and a net cash balance, to a riskier, less certain integration story with leverage around 3x EBITDA. Unsurprisingly, the market questioned the company's decision to change course so sharply as well as its ability to integrate these three acquisitions while continuing to maintain its core organic growth story, and the stock sold off sharply, ultimately reaching a low of $15.73 per share after its third-quarter earnings report last month. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that Clearwater had engaged advisers to evaluate strategic options after receiving a bevy of unsolicited offers from firms like Thoma Bravo and even Warburg Pincus and Permira, both of whom still had representatives on the board. These announcements prompted Starboard to disclose its nearly 5% position in Clearwater and urge the company to run a robust sales process if it has received in-bound interest from potential buyers. But don't misunderstand Starboard's motive or thesis. They are not short-term strategic investors jumping on an opportunity for a quick return. They have likely been looking at Clearwater for many months and had owned it because they like the standalone story and see an opportunity to create long term value. But, to paraphrase the overused quote attributed to Mike Tyson (but really said by Cus D'Amato), everyone has a plan until they get hit. And Starboard is as good as anyone with rolling with the punches. So, when news surfaces that the company is considering a sale and that two of its board members may be bidders, Starboard is doing what any good activist would do and making sure there is a fair process to maximize value for shareholders. Starboard will then decide whether that price is better than the risk adjusted value shareholders could receive from a standalone plan of integrating the acquisitions and growing the core business. Moreover, a credible and fair process could likely attract additional bidders, including strategics such as BlackRock and Nasdaq. While the leveraged buyout math works in the high $20s per share, strategics could push it to a 3 handle.  There could be a quick resolution here if the board decides to sell to the company and receives a bid that is good for everyone. But that is a risky activist thesis on its own. What makes this a good activist campaign for Starboard is that they are a believer in the company as a standalone entity and see a path to create shareholder value. If the standalone path is ultimately pursued, it would make a lot of sense for the private equity investors who no longer own any material position to resign from the board and be replaced with industry experts and a shareholder representative who can guide management through a standalone plan. Essentially, there are three potential outcomes to Clearwater's current inflection point: (i) a standalone plan where the company integrates its acquisitions and grows its core; (ii) a sale of the company for a satisfactory premium following a real and competitive review process; or (iii) an abbreviated sale process orchestrated in part by Warburg and Permira resulting in a sale to Warburg and Permira. Starboard would likely be happy with (i) or (ii) and we expect them to do everything within their power to prevent (iii).Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "body": "Hoda Kotb knows what it's like to completely overhaul a career and start fresh in a brand-new industry.The longtime journalist left NBC's \"TODAY\" in January after 26 years with the organization, and launched her own company — a wellness brand called Joy 101 — in May. Becoming a first-time CEO at age 60 felt somewhat impossible to her, which is exactly why she decided to do it, she said on a Dec. 8 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Whether you're \"20 or 40 or 60 or 80,\" you can determine whether such a drastic career change is right for you by asking yourself one important question, said Kotb, now 61: Is this job giving me what I deserve?In Kotb's case, she was ready for a new challenge, and realized during an on-air 60th birthday celebration that continuing her journalism career probably wouldn't fulfill that need, she said. \"I was almost having an out of body [experience],\" she said. \"I kept thinking ... This is the top of the wave. I could feel it ... This is the best it's ever going to be.\"Other people may come to a similar conclusion through more a frustrating process: Maybe you've worked a job where you didn't receive enough positive feedback, or the company lacked opportunities for you to learn and grow.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyIf you feel like you're hitting a professional roadblock, you should sit down and figure out what it is that you feel like you deserve, said Kotb. That self-audit shouldn't come from a place of envy or \"FOMO\" around what someone else has, she noted. And it won't always prompt a total career reset — maybe you'll seek a raise or promotion at work instead, for example.\"Look at your life, just look at it from 35,000 feet and then decide, do I want to change it?\" she said. \"And I'm here to tell you, I feel like I'm living, breathing proof that you can change it at any time. Things you thought were impossible are not impossible.\"Kotb has previously said that her decision to leave \"TODAY\" was also influenced by a desire to spend more time with her family. This was made difficult by her daily 3:15 a.m. wakeup to get to work on time, she told People in May.Entrepreneurship now presents Kotb with a different kind of challenge, she's said. \"Being an entrepreneur is hard,\" Kotb told Variety in May. \"I didn't realize how many hats you wear as an entrepreneur ... I'm learning how to be a boss.\"To make building a new career from scratch feel less intimidating, you can start small, Kotb recommended: Spend 30 minutes per day doing something that'll help you make progress, from working on your resume to creating a business plan or learning a new skill. After a month, for example, you'll have 900 minutes of groundwork, rather than making a spur-of-the-moment decision to quit your job without a plan.\"Baby steps toward the jump,\" said Kotb. \"Sometimes we think we want it and you're like, 'I'm going to run and jump off the cliff' ... Don't do that. We're not idiots. We need our paychecks. We need our insurance. We need these things, but we can explore possibilities at the same time.\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks with the press as he meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesIn a sign of easing pressure on India, U.S. President Donald Trump said that trade talks with New Delhi were going well, and he could visit the country next year.Trump who was speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday said India \"has largely stopped buying oil from Russia,\" and if Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended him an invite, he would visit the country in 2026.Evoking memories of his last visit to India, Trump called Modi \"his friend\" and a \"great man.\"In the last few months, India and U.S. relations have been under stress, with experts warning of missing chemistry between the two leaders, leading to a disconnect between India-US ties.Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan and India's purchases of Russian crude are among issues that have led to a deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.India currently faces 50% tariffs on it exports, higher than the 47% duties on China.\"Negotiations between New Delhi and Washington D.C. are ongoing and both sides appear optimistic about trade deal being reached by the end of the year, possibly even in the next few weeks,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research of Oxford Economics.The tariff rate on Indian goods could be cut to 20% from 50% currently, putting India in comparable level to its Asian peers such as Vietnam, Thailand, or the Philippines, she said.Hermann added that the baseline tariff on India \"may not fall to Japan and South Korea's level of 15%\" due to sticking points around purchases of Russian oil, agricultural imports, and limited scope to commit to sizable investments in the U.S.Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctioned on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, which will come into force from Nov 21. As a result Indian and Chinese refiners have started to cut down imports of Russian oil.According to a Reuters report on Thursday, Russian oil is trading at its steepest discounts to Brent in a year in Asia, as major Indian and Chinese refiners reduce purchases.India's Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's query on the country cutting Russian oil imports.\"Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn't realistic for India,\" said Prateek Pandey head of APAC oil and gas research at Rystad Energy, adding that as Russian crude becomes available at a sharper discount \"New Delhi's approach of \"economics first\" will be tested more than ever.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs and Musk said he was also considering working with Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains powering almost all modern technologies, from smartphones and cars to robotics. Demand has surged amid the AI boom. Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity could reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

    "body": "The logo of SoftBank is displayed at a company shop in Tokyo, Japan January 28, 2025. Issei Kato | ReutersShares of Japan's SoftBank Group resumed their slide on Friday, following a broader slump in AI-related stocks as investors once again grew wary of the sector's lofty valuations.The group, which holds a wide range of AI investments across infrastructure, semiconductor, and application companies, saw shares drop more than 8%.This comes after SoftBank gained nearly 3% in the previous session, having plunged 10% on Wednesday to clock its worst day since April. It stares at about $53 billion market cap wipeout this week and its worst weekly loss since March 2020, if Friday's losses hold.\"SoftBank Group's shares are falling as many bought it as the only listed proxy for OpenAI,\" said David Gibson, senior research analyst at financial services firm MST Financial.The pullback reflects growing caution around the AI sector and a realization that many of OpenAI's partnerships are still potential rather than confirmed, with funding prospects uncertain, he told CNBC.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the company has spoken with the U.S. government about potential federal loan guarantees to encourage chip factory construction. His comments came after OpenAI's CFO suggested the firm hoped for federal help in securing chip financing.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of SoftBank Group fall following renewed pressure on AI-linked stocksSoftBank holds a controlling stake in U.K.-based semiconductor designer Arm Holdings, whose chips help power mobile and AI processors globally. Shares of Nasdaq-listed Arm slid 1.21% overnight.Separately, Bloomberg recently reported citing people familiar with the matter that the group considered acquiring U.S. chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. earlier this year.Broader declineOther Japanese tech stocks also declined. Semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest dropped over 6%, chipmaker Renesas Electronics fell nearly 4%, Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, declined 1.46%.Shares of the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, fell 0.6%.Nvidia-supplier SK Hynix was down over 1% and South Korean peer and memory chipmaker Samsung fell 0.5%.The declines in Asian tech stocks also come after AI-related companies in the U.S. fell overnightQualcomm dropped almost 4%, despite strong quarterly results, after warning it could lose future Apple business. AMD, a strong performer Wednesday, slipped 7%, while Palantir and Oracle were down about 7% and 3%, respectively. Nvidia and Meta Platforms also finished lower.The excitement surrounding AI has raised worries that markets might be experiencing a tech bubble. Some experts argue that the valuations of AI companies are starting to resemble the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with stock prices rising well beyond realistic profit forecasts.The economic impact of artificial intelligence is undeniable and market bumps are inevitable, said Laura Cooper, global investment strategist at Nuveen.\"Still, it's too soon to call a bubble. Today's AI capex is being funded largely by cash-rich firms with solid balance sheets, not cheap credit or speculation,\" she said. \"The greater risk isn't a bubble bursting, but valuation fatigue — investors tiring of paying ever-richer premiums for AI returns that don't materialize quickly enough.\"",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "Wegovy injection pens arranged in Waterbury, Vermont, US, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of their blockbuster weight loss drugs. Under the agreements, the monthly out-of-pocket cost of popular injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has, Trump administration officials said. Existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy, carry list prices above $1,000 a month, which has prevented many patients from taking them. Both companies have introduced lower cost options for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites.But the deals with Trump, as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy, take those efforts to expand access even further. Here's how much weight loss drugs could cost for patients under the new agreements, based on the details shared so far.Medicare Medicare has covered GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and some other medical conditions: for example, Wegovy for slashing cardiovascular risks. But under the new deals, Medicare will start covering the drugs for obesity for the first time starting in mid-2026, which could allow more seniors to qualify for them and spur more private insurers to cover them.Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Patients are eligible if they fall into these three cohorts:The first includes those who are overweight — with a body mass index greater than 27 — or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure.The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk voluntarily agreed to reduce the prices the government pays for existing GLP-1 drugs already approved for diabetes and other uses to $245 a month, across all non-starting doses. Savings generated by those price reductions will allow Medicare to start paying that same price point for GLP-1s for patients with obesity and a high metabolic or cardiovascular risk. Direct-to-consumerThe agreement will also allow patients to get GLP-1s on direct-to-consumer platforms at steeper discounts than they already receive through drugmakers' existing sites.On TrumpRx – the government's direct-to-consumer platform for buying prescription drugs with cash expected to launch next year – the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior administration officials.Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid. Under the deals announced Thursday, the drugmakers will get fast-track reviews of their forthcoming pills. Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per monthMedicaidState Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 drugs for obesity is spotty. But Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other non-starting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not. Check with your state government about coverage.",

    "body": "Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) signage at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November by Friday, rejecting the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program for 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.\"People have gone without for too long,\" Judge Jack McConnell said during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, where he issued the order.McConnell said the Trump administration, which had already agreed to tap a congressionally authorized contingency fund to pay partial SNAP benefits, must also use so-called Section 32 funds that it had refused to tap earlier this week.\"The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur\" if SNAP is not fully funded, said McConnell.He noted in a written order that more than half of the program's recipients are children, seniors and veterans.\"While the President of the United States professes a commitment to helping those it serves, the government's actions tell a different story,\" McConnell wrote.\"Faced with a choice between advancing relief and entrenching delay, it chose the latter — an outcome that predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers.\"The order came after plaintiffs in the case urged him to reject the plan to pay only partial benefits, which the administration disclosed in a court filing in Providence on Monday.The Trump administration later Thursday asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn the judge's new order, as well as an order he issued Friday directing the administration to make partial benefit payments as soon as possible.McConnell at the hearing pointed to a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday said that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"Trump's post seemed to contradict statements by administration lawyers that the benefits would be partially paid for the month.The White House later said there was no change in that plan, but also said it would take time to issue the partial benefits to recipients.McConnell said that Trump's post was effectively an admission that the administration intended to defy his prior order to seek out all possible funding sources so that full benefits could be paid.The Trump administration last week said it would not use the contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November. The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutting down on Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.A group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions, and business organizations sued the administration, seeking to force it to use the contingency funds and potentially other money to fund SNAP.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteMcConnell, during a court hearing last Friday, blocked the administration from halting SNAP benefits and ordered that it pay benefits from the contingency fund \"as soon as possible,\" and investigate whether other funds could be tapped to fully fund the program for the month.On Monday, the administration told McConnell it would pay 50% of the benefits by using the contingency fund. But it ruled out using at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program, as well as other sources.On Wednesday night, the administration updated its plan, saying that 65% of the benefits would be paid.McConnell at Thursday's hearing blasted the U.S. Department of Agriculture for refusing to use the Nutrition Program's funds to help fully pay November's benefits, calling that decision \"arbitrary and capricious.\"\"USDA had an obligation, beginning ... Oct. 1, when the shutdown began, to prepare to use the contingency funds so that the recipients would get their benefits as expected on Nov. 1,\" McConnell said.\"USDA did not do so,\" he said. \"Even when Nov. 1 came, USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds, USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.\"Earlier Thursday, a coalition of around two dozen states asked another federal judge, in Boston, to order the administration to fully fund SNAP benefits. McConnell's order came before that judge had time to rule on that request.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state is one of the plaintiffs in the Boston suit, in a statement said, \"A judge in Rhode Island just stopped the federal government from starving millions of Americans.\"\"I am relieved that people will get the food they need, but it is outrageous that it took a lawsuit to make the federal government feed its own people,\" James said.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, speaks during the 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting on Nov. 6, 2025.Courtesy: TeslaTesla said shareholders voted in favor of CEO Elon Musk's almost $1 trillion pay plan, with 75% support among voting shares.Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September. Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against it.Results of the vote were announced on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Austin, Texas.A separate proposal, submitted by an individual investor, Stephen Hawk, called for Tesla to be able to invest in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup that was formed in March 2023 to compete with OpenAI. Brandon Ehrhart, general counsel at Tesla, said at the meeting that the company had \"received more votes in favor than we did in against,\" but that there were a number of abstentions and that Tesla is considering next steps.The pay package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2024. His ownership would increase from about 13% to 25%, adding more than 423 million shares to his holdings.The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Tesla's current market cap is $1.54 trillion. Awards tied to market cap gains are paired with operational achievements. The next nine tranches would be awarded if Tesla's value increases by increments of $500 billion, up to $6.5 trillion. Musk would earn the last two tranches if the market cap rises by increments of $1 trillion, meaning it would need to hit $8.5 trillion for Musk to get the full package.Tesla also laid out a series of earnings milestones for Musk, beginning with $50 billion in annual adjusted profit and moving up to $400 billion. In the third quarter, Tesla reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion.Other goals tied to the newly approved pay plan include reaching 20 million vehicle deliveries, 10 million active FSD (Full Self-Driving) subscriptions​, 1 million bots (Optimus humanoid robots) delivered and​ 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. To date, Tesla has delivered more than 8 million vehicles, according to its September proxy statement.The proposed plan doesn't specify whether the FSD subscriptions must be purchased or could include free trials. Tesla currently provides partially automated driving systems, which it markets as \"FSD Supervised\" in the U.S. The company intends to improve its FSD Supervised systems so they don't require human supervision on board.At the meeting, Musk claimed that Optimus robots \"will eliminate poverty,\" \"give everyone amazing medical care,\" and will be \"bigger than cell phones, bigger than anything.\" He also said the robots could be used for \"containment of future crime\" by following criminals around and stopping them from \"doing crime.\"There's currently no Optimus robot on the market, and Musk didn't provide a target date for reaching those goals.As Reuters previously reported, Musk could still score tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of the targets laid out for him by the board, collecting more than $50 billion just by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals.There are also a list of \"covered events\" in the award terms that would allow Musk to earn shares without meeting the required operational milestones.Covered events include natural disasters, wars, pandemics, and changes to \"international, federal, state and local law, regulations or other governmental action or inaction,\" that could hamper the company's ability to design, manufacture or sell its products down the line.Shareholders voted on the new plan after the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled last year that Musk's earlier 2018 pay plan was improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. Musk appealed that ruling and the matter will be decided by the Delaware State Supreme Court.In addition to leading Tesla, Musk runs xAI which has merged with X, leads SpaceX and its satellite internet business Starlink, and is a founder of brain computer interface company Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Company.He's also been heavily engaged in politics, most notably working to propel President Donald Trump back to the White House, and then leading a sweeping effort to slash the federal government at the beginning of his second term.The National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper last month estimating that Tesla sales from October 2022 through April of this year in the U.S. would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's \"polarizing and partisan actions.\"The newly approved pay plan puts no limits on Musk's political activity, and does not establish a minimum amount of time he must spend working at Tesla.WATCH: Tesla shareholders approve Musk's pay planwatch now",

The term superintelligence typically refers to machines deemed more intelligent than the smartest people.Suleyman was a co-founder of AI lab DeepMind, which Google bought in 2014. After leaving Google in 2022, he co-founded and led AI startup Inflection. Microsoft hired Suleyman and several other Inflection employees last year.Top technology companies have rushed to hire leading AI engineers and researchers, augmenting their products with generative AI capabilities. The boom started with OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in 2022. Microsoft uses OpenAI models in Bing and Copilot, while OpenAI runs workloads in Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft also owns a $135 billion equity stake in OpenAI following a restructuring.Microsoft has taken steps to reduce its dependence on OpenAI. After the Inflection deal, the software company also began drawing on models from Google and from Anthropic, which was founded by former OpenAI executives.The new Microsoft AI research group will focus on providing useful companions for people that can help in education and other domains, Suleyman wrote in his blog post. It will also pursue narrow areas in medicine and in renewable energy production.\"We'll have expert level performance at the full range of diagnostics, alongside highly capable planning and prediction in operational clinical settings,\" Suleyman wrote.As investors and analysts are increasingly voicing their concerns about overspending on AI without a clear path to profits, Suleyman said he wants \"to make clear that we are not building a superintelligence at any cost, with no limits.\" WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAirlines rushed to provide travelers updates after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would reduce flights across 40 airports as the longest government shutdown in history continues to drag on.Many major airlines said they would waive cancellation fees for even their most basic tickets, which often come with penalties for changes.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy previously said he would reduce flight capacity by roughly 10%, affecting 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.The FAA has not yet announced which \"high traffic\" airports would be affected.These are the airports that are expected to be impacted, based on preliminary information before the agency meets with airlines to finalize cuts, CNBC's Phil LeBeau reported. The preliminary list includes some of the country's largest airports and major international hubs in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York City.Preliminary list:ANC - Anchorage InternationalATL - Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta InternationalBOS - Boston Logan InternationalBWI - Baltimore/Washington InternationalCLT - Charlotte Douglas InternationalCVG - Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky InternationalDAL - Dallas LoveDCA - Ronald Reagan Washington NationalDEN - Denver InternationalDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth InternationalDTW - Detroit Metropolitan Wayne CountyEWR - Newark Liberty InternationalFLL - Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood InternationalHNL - Honolulu InternationalHOU - Houston HobbyIAD - Washington Dulles InternationalIAH - George Bush Houston IntercontinentalIND - Indianapolis InternationalJFK - New York John F.

Air traffic controllers, who are considered essential employees required to work during a shutdown, have missed paychecks, and the FAA has said the closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among controllers.Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time.\"We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,\" Duffy added.Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he could \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown drags on.FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday that additional measures may be implemented after the reduction, which he said he has never seen before in his time in the industry. The officials said they were planning to meet with airlines to discuss which flights would be cut.watch nowAirline responseIn a Wednesday memo to United Airlines employees, CEO Scott Kirby said the carrier will not be reducing long-haul international flying and hub-to-hub flying, instead reducing regional and domestic flights that do not fly between hubs.The airline also offered all customers refunds even if their flights are not impacted. Kirby said that included \"non-refundable tickets and those customers with basic economy tickets.\"On Thursday afternoon, the airline preemptively said it was going to cancel 4% of its flights from Friday through Sunday.In a statement, Delta Air Lines said it expects to operate the \"vast majority\" of its flights as scheduled and will offer changes, cancellations or refunds for customers' flights during the impacted period. Delta also said that would include basic economy fares, without penalty.The airline added on Thursday afternoon that it will cancel flights a day in advance to allow customers enough time. Delta has already canceled 170 flights scheduled for Friday.Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said he highly recommends travelers flying Friday or in the next 10 days book a backup ticket on another carrier as the flight reductions begin to avoid getting stranded due to cancellations.\"I'm sorry this is happening. Hopefully the shutdown is over soon,\" Biffle wrote on LinkedIn. \"Just giving everyone practical travel advice.\"American Airlines said it expects that the \"vast majority of customers' travel will proceed as planned,\" adding that the carrier will reach out to travelers proactively as schedule changes occur.The airline also said that it will offer immediate rebooking options for all impacted travelers and that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason will be able to change their flight or request a refund without penalty. As of Thursday morning, the airline was still awaiting clarifying information from the FAA about which of its flights will be impacted.Southwest Airlines also released a statement saying that the majority of its flights will not be impacted and that its international flights should operate as usual. The airline said it will \"proactively communicate well in advance and will offer flexibility in travel plans.\"The Association of Flight Attendants, representing 55,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines, released a statement Wednesday urging Congress to end the shutdown so air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration workers can get paid.\"The false narrative that this shutdown is a choice of either paying federal workers or protecting affordable healthcare is outrageous when both crises were manufactured by the exact people who can fix it,\" the statement read.What travelers need to knowPassengers check in at an American Airlines' counter at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, the United States, on Oct. 10, 2025. Li Rui | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesExperts recommend consumers who are set to travel in the next week stay on top of flight cancellations and delays through the websites and apps.Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at travel site The Points Guy, said flexibility \"is going to be key\" as travelers rush to rebook, adding it's important to download each airline's mobile app and enable all notifications.\"A lot of the times, you have to actually enable notifications on individual trips or in your account to text you if there are changes or disruptions,\" Ewen told CNBC.He recommended anyone with nonurgent travel reschedule their trips, though that likely only applies to a small number of travelers, and consider choosing other forms of transportation instead. For essential trips, Ewen said passengers should be prepared for long wait times, use self-service rebooking tools, and be aware of the fact that many other people will also be rebooking and scrambling for limited seats.Ewen said he has been covering the industry for many years, and the last time he and his colleagues saw a major, national disruption in air travel like this was 9/11.\"The biggest thing is a lot of kindness goes a long way,\" he said. \"So if you're at an airport and you find out that your flight is canceled, I promise you screaming at that airline employee is not going to get you rebooked any faster — in fact, it's probably going to make them less likely to be willing to help you. So recognize that everyone is in this together.\"AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said the company recommends arriving at the airport extra early to avoid long lines and avoid checking in a bag if possible in case flights get canceled.\"Ultimately, there's a lot that's out of travelers' control — so control what you can, and be as flexible as possible,\" Diaz said.Travel insuranceTravel insurance can reimburse consumers for certain costs and inconveniences incurred from a trip disruption, like flight cancellations, delays, lost luggage, or unforeseen costs for lodging and meals.Consumers have been buying travel insurance at an elevated rate amid the government shutdown, but travel and insurance experts warn that such policies don't offer blanket protection for shutdown-related travel snafus, and a lot depends on the fine print.For example, a policyholder generally can't get insurance benefits if they choose to cancel their travel plans to avoid any headaches. Cancel-for-any-reason coverage is an exception, though it also comes with its own caveats.Whether or not a policyholder gets compensated may come down to the rationale an airline provides for a delayed or canceled flight.Many insurers only pay benefits if a delay or cancellation is attributable to a \"common carrier\" disruption like a mechanical failure, travel experts said.\"Airlines typically won't cite causes other than operational terms like 'mechanical issues' or general delays, cancellations, or lost belongings, even during a government shutdown,\" Lauren McCormick, a spokesperson for Squaremouth, an online platform for comparing travel insurance policies, wrote in a recent blog post. \"So, these are generally still covered under most comprehensive travel insurance plans.\"— CNBC's Phil LeBeau contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer unpacked Thursday's market decline, telling investors that Wall Street is worried about the lengthy government shutdown and that artificial intelligence buildout is getting out of control.\"What matters is we need the darn government to go back to work, and we need the data center blob to be cordoned off from the rest of the economy, and we need some of the hottest stocks to continue to cool off further,\" he said. \"Until then, we are indeed at the mercy of the headlines and, lately, the darned negative headlines are the only ones that anyone's paying attention to.\"The averages closed in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing down 0.84% and the S&P 500 dipping 1.12%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 1.9%, and the tech-heavy index is on pace to have its worst week since early April.The federal shutdown entered its 37th full day on Thursday and is the longest in U.S. history. Hundreds of thousands of employees remain furloughed or are working essential jobs without pay. The ongoing shutdown has delayed key official economic data, Cramer said, so investors are largely in the dark about the health of the economy. But he pointed to a few pieces of other information, including one firm's report that suggests job cuts in October hit their highest level for the month in 22 years.Cramer referenced analysis by JPMorgan's Michael Cembalest, who suggested an AI and data center \"blob\" is starting to engulf many parts of the economy. Cramer said the blob has become \"increasingly menacing\" as giants like OpenAI commit to spending billions on new technology. Investors were spooked when OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar suggested earlier this week that the government could backstop her company's data center buildout, he noted. Friar later denied that OpenAI needs a federal backstop, but Cramer indicated many on Wall Street remain wary.\"We've been able to skate past the bear for the past few weeks,\" he said. \"I don't think that's possible any longer.\"watch now",

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy confirmed to CNBC that the company has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is produced at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "Guests enjoy the Fortune Global Forum 2025 Gala Dinner on October 26, 2025 at Diriyah Gate, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Cedric Ribeiro | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMining executives have welcomed a sharp upswing in investor interest from the Middle East, as Gulf states seek to expand their critical mineral ambitions and take on established global players.Critical minerals refer to a subset of materials considered essential to the energy transition. These resources, which tend to have a high risk of supply chain disruption, include metals such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements.\"The interest in rare earths in this part of the world is phenomenal,\" Tony Sage, CEO of U.S.-listed rare earths miner Critical Metals, said during a business trip through the Middle East.\"I didn't expect it because, you know, they can't mine it. There [are] really no discoveries in this area, but they want to be able to participate somehow in the downstream,\" Sage told CNBC by telephone.His comments come as policymakers and business leaders flock to Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh, an event nicknamed as the \"Davos in the Desert.\"The annual event, which got underway on Monday, is being held under the theme: \"The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.\" It is expected this year's FII will lean into areas such as artificial intelligence, particularly as the oil-rich kingdom continues with its mission to diversify its economy.A wheel loader takes ore to a crusher at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.Steve Marcus | ReutersAnalysts say Gulf states, led by the likes of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are increasingly seeking to leverage their financial capital and geographic location to capture critical minerals market share.A series of targeted acquisitions and international partnerships forms a key part of this regional strategy, according to an analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), with Gulf states seeking to present themselves as alternative partners to Western nations.Critical Metals, for its part, has partnered with Saudi Arabia's Obeikan Group to build a large-scale lithium hydroxide processing plant in the kingdom.A strategic pushKevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, linked investor interest in rare earths from the Middle East to exponential growth in the field of AI.\"It's no surprise that you're seeing interest, not just in the Western world, but spreading into the Gulf States because I think people are realizing that we're probably on the cusp of an AI boom,\" Das told CNBC by telephone.\"If you start to see the emergence of robotics, every robot is going to need these rare earths. And I think the supply is only going to get tighter,\" he added.Read moreRare earth elements have emerged as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, although global stocks rallied on Monday amid investor hopes of thawing tensions between the world's two largest economies.U.S. officials have touted the prospect of China delaying strict rare earth export controls as part of a high-stakes summit between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping on Thursday.Rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table whose atomic structure gives them special magnetic properties. These elements are widely used in the automotive, robotics and defense sectors.U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a “coffee ceremony” at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Win Mcnamee | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShaun Bunn, managing director at London-listed Empire Metals, said his company had also received considerable investor interest from the Middle East.\"I think that it is very much part of the kingdom's strategic push to diversify away from its oil. I mean, they are always going to make the most money out of oil at the moment at least, but they are trying to diversify,\" Bunn told CNBC by telephone.Critical mineral ambitionsAnalysts have flagged a number of barriers facing the Gulf states' push for critical minerals, however, noting that regional players remain marginal producers at present.\"Many of Saudi Arabia's mining ventures remain in early or even conceptual stages, and the country still depends on foreign partners for expertise, such that it may take years for Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states more generally, to scale up enough to dent Chinese dominance or to fully meet Western demand,\" Asna Wajid, research analyst at IISS, said in an analysis published in late July.\"Many in the West, moreover, may be wary of replacing their dependence on China with dependence on the Gulf states, which already exercise considerable strategic leverage due to their oil and gas supplies,\" Wajid said.China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing roughly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and processing them.U.S. officials have previously warned that this dominance poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.",

    "body": "Dan Rosensweig, CEO, CheggScott Mlyn | CNBCChegg said on Monday it would lay off about 45% of its workforce, or 388 employees, as the \"new realities\" of artificial intelligence and diminished traffic from internet search have led to plummeting revenue. The online education company, founded 20 years ago, has been hit by the rise of generative AI software tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, which have become increasingly popular among students. Chegg also sued Google in February, arguing that AI summaries of search results have hurt its traffic and sales.The company reiterated that claim on Monday, saying AI and \"reduced traffic from Google to content publishers\" have damaged its business.\"As a result, and reflecting the company's continued investment in AI, Chegg is restructuring the way it operates its academic learning products,\" the company said.The cuts come after Chegg in May laid off 22% of its workforce, citing increasing adoption of AI.Chegg went public in 2013 and saw its stock price hit a high of $113.51 in February 2021, boosted by the Covid pandemic and a shift to remote learning. The stock has since lost 99% of its value. Its market cap peaked at about $14.7 billion, before falling to roughly $156 million.The company offers textbook rentals, homework help and tutoring, as well as a newer suite of AI tools like a service that automatically generates flashcards.As part of Monday's announcement, the company said Dan Rosensweig will return as CEO effective immediately, replacing Nathan Schultz, who will step down from the role and remain as an executive advisor to Rosensweig and Chegg's board.Rosensweig, a former top executive at Yahoo who joined Chegg as CEO in 2010, stepped down from the post in April 2024, handing the job to Schultz, who was operating chief at the time.Chegg also said it plans to remain a standalone company, ending a strategic review process that began earlier this year.\"After thoughtful consideration of multiple proposals, the board unanimously determined that remaining an independent public company offers the best opportunity to maximize long-term shareholder value,\" the company said.In April, Chegg was at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Chegg received the warning when the stock was trading at about 60 cents. Trading below $1 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period triggers a warning. By May, the stock was back over $1.— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Chegg sues Google over AI-generated information blurbs in searcheswatch now",

Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersThink of Saudi Arabia and the first thing that comes to mind might be its massive, oil-derived wealth.While oil continues to drive Saudi Arabia's economy, the kingdom is now expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence, tourism and sports to diversify its growth avenues.According to Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih, more than half — 50.6% — of the Saudi economy is now \"completely decoupled\" from oil.\"This percentage is growing,\" Al Falih told CNBC's Dan Murphy, adding that government revenue used to be almost completely derived from oil money, but now, 40% of its revenue comes from sectors and sources that \"have nothing to do with oil.\"\"We're seeing great results, but we're not satisfied. We want to do more. We want to accelerate the kingdom's diversification and growth story,\" he said.Saudi Arabia is doubling down on fast-growing sectors such as artificial intelligence, naming it one of its new growth areas, with Al Falih saying the kingdom will be a \"key investor\" in developing AI applications and large language models. Saudi Arabia would also build data centers \"at a scale and at a competitive cost not achieved anywhere else.\"\"AI has emerged [in] the last three, four years, and it's definitely going to define how the future economy of every nation. Those who invest will lead, and those who lag behind, unfortunately, will lose,\" he pointed out.On Monday, AI chip company Groq's CEO, Jonathan Ross, told CNBC that  for AI infrastructure thanks to its energy surplus. The country could see more than $135 billion in gains by 2030 thanks to AI, according to PwC.Saudi Arabia's quarterly budget performance report revealed that total government revenue for the first half of 2025 came in at 565.21 billion Saudi riyals ($150.73 billion), with oil making up 53.4% of the country's overall revenue, down from 67.97% in the same period in 2019.In 2024, the country reported a 1.3% rise in full-year GDP, mainly driven by a 4.3% increase in non-oil segments. Oil activity, on the other hand, fell 4.5% year on year.The country's sovereign wealth fund — the Public Investment Fund — has acquired stakes in tech giants, video game publishers and football clubs as it uses oil revenues to diversify into other sectors.PIF has acquired stakes in video-game heavyweight Electronic Arts, establishing the SoftBank Vision Fund with Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp in 2017, and a takeover of English Premier League club Newcastle United in 2021.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhen asked if declining oil prices were piling pressure on Saudi Arabia's economy and government revenue, Al Falih said that the country was not scaling back budgets and there were no cuts to public spending.Oil prices have fallen in 2025, with Brent crude spot prices down 13.4% so far this year, according to FactSet. Saudi Arabia's oil revenue slid 24% in the first half of 2025 from a year earlier.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe government will continue to address all activities that require government spending, Al Falih said, noting that the PIF has grown sixfold since its creation and that the country was approaching nearly $1 trillion in capital deployed across sectors of strategic interest.Tourism has also been a key growth area for Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Al-Khateeb, the country's tourism minister, told CNBC that the sector's share in GDP had grown to 5% in 2024 from 3% in 2019.\"We are [opening] resorts, new airlines, new airports, and the numbers are growing, and we are focusing on countries and visitors that are coming from outside to experience our great culture,\" Al-Khateeb highlighted.The tourism minister also expressed confidence that the sector could contribute 10% of GDP by 2030, aiming to raise it to 20% eventually.\"This 20% will help Saudi Arabia to diversify the economy and make it more sustainable,\" he added.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed that the list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been winnowed down to five, and President Donald Trump said the replacement is likely to be named by the end of the year.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Bessent said the finalists are current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, according to several media outlets.Those names were reported earlier this month by CNBC.Bessent, who had been rumored to be a top candidate as well, said he has been conducting interviews and that he expects to do one more round before presenting a \"good slate\" to Trump after the Thanksgiving holiday.Trump, also speaking to reporters Monday on Air Force One, said he anticipates naming a replacement by the end of the year. Powell's term doesn't expire until May. Powell then can either step down from the Fed entirely or continue serving a term as governor that lasts until 2028.The Federal Open Market Committee meets this week, with an interest rate decision due Wednesday. Markets are pricing in a near certainty that the committee will lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, which would follow a similar cut in September.Trump has three appointees on the seven-member board of governors: Waller and Bowman, as well as Stephen Miran, who is filling an unexpired term that ends in January. Miran, who was confirmed in September as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, is not expected to be reappointed. He has campaigned for the FOMC to be more aggressive in easing.Should Powell opt to leave the Fed, that would give Trump four appointees. Trump thus far has been unsuccessful in trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook from the board. A rotating cast of five regional presidents joins the governors as voters during the FOMC meeting.",

That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce. It has roughly 350,000 corporate employees.The planned layoffs would also represent the biggest job cuts across the tech industry since at least 2020, according to Layoffs.fyi. As of Monday, more than 200 tech companies have laid off approximately 98,000 employees since the start of the year, according to the site, which monitors job cuts in the tech sector.Microsoft has laid off about 15,000 people so far this year, while Meta last week eliminated roughly 600 jobs within its artificial intelligence unit. Google cut more than 100 design-related roles in its cloud unit earlier this month, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in September the company laid off 4,000 customer support staffers, pointing to its increasing AI adoption as a catalyst behind the cuts. Intel's cuts this year totaled 22,000 jobs, the most of any listed by Layoffs.fyi.The steepest year for job cuts in tech came in 2023, as the industry reckoned with soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Close to 1,200 tech companies slashed over 260,000 jobs, the site said.Over the past year, companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have also pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing size of their workforces.Amazon has conducted rolling layoffs across the company since 2022, which has resulted in more than 27,000 employees being let go. Job reductions have continued this year, though at a smaller scale. Amazon's cloud, stores, communications and devices divisions have been hit with layoffs in recent months.The layoffs are part of a broader cost-cutting campaign by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. Jassy has also moved to simplify Amazon's corporate structure by having fewer managers in order to \"remove layers and flatten organizations.\"Jassy said in June that Amazon's workforce could shrink further as a result of the company embracing generative AI, telling staffers that the company \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"\"It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,\" Jassy said in the June memo to staff.WATCH: Report: Amazon targets as many as 30,000 corporate job cuts beginning Tuesdaywatch now",

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economy expanded at its fastest pace in more than a year, with its third-quarter gross domestic product growth topping analysts' estimates on Tuesday.According to advance estimates from Bank of Korea, GDP rose 1.7%, year on year, compared to the 1.5% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. The economy had grown by 0.6% in the second quarter.Data from the Bank of Korea revealed that growth was mostly supported by exports and the manufacturing sector that expanded 6% and 3.3%, respectively, year on year.The construction sector was the biggest drag on the economy, contracting 8.1% in the reported quarter compared to a year earlier.The growth in exports of goods and services, which came on the back of increased semiconductor and motor vehicle shipments, was the fastest since the third quarter of 2024.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the country's GDP expanded 1.2%, also beating Reuters poll estimates of a 0.9% growth.Experts that spoke to CNBC highlighted that although export figures were stronger on a year-on-year basis, compared to the second quarter, growth actually declined. HSBC's Korea economist Jin Choi told CNBC that the the annual rate was boosted by low base effects from last year. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, export growth slowed to 1.5% from 4.5% in the second quarter.\"For Korea's exports, we think there were relatively limited signs of frontloading, while global AI demand will likely continue to buttress Korea's semiconductor exports,\" Choi said.Homin Lee, senior macro strategist from Lombard Odier, said that the sequential fall was evidence that payback from tariff-related frontloading has already taken place to a degree.Lee said while there may be \"residual\" frontloading in non-tech exports facing tariff uncertainties, the main drivers for better growth in the third quarter were consumption and investment.These areas were boosted by the resolution of the post-martial law constitutional crisis, consumption voucher program, and broadening global AI capex boom, he added.HSBC's Choi said that going forward, continued private consumption recovery, a bottoming out of the construction sector, and expansionary fiscal policy, rather than exports, will be the main drivers for Korea's growth recovery.Trade talksSouth Korea's GDP data comes as the country's negotiators continue to wrangle over details of a trade deal with the Trump administration. In an interview with Bloomberg last Friday, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung said that the two country's were deadlocked on key details over Seoul's $350 billion investment pledge.\"The U.S. will of course try to maximize its interests, but it mustn't be to the extent that causes catastrophic consequences for South Korea,\" Lee said in the interview.In July, South Korea reached a trade deal with Trump that featured blanket tariffs on the country's exports to U.S. at 15% — down from the 25% Trump announced earlier. In return, Seoul had pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S.Lee is set to meet Trump on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit being held in Gyeongju, South Korea, later this week.The Bank of Korea in its statement last Thursday said that the economy has continued to improve, supported by a sustained recovery in consumption and favorable exports growth.\"Going forward, domestic demand is expected to continue its recovery, led by consumption, and exports are likely to remain favourable for some time owing to the strong semiconductor sector, but the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports are likely to expand gradually,\" the BOK added.The central bank has forecast full-year growth for 2025 at 0.9%, and 1.6% for 2026",

    "body": "watch nowQualcomm announced Monday that it will release new artificial intelligence accelerator chips, marking new competition for Nvidia, which has so far dominated the market for AI semiconductors.The stock soared 11% following the news.The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers.Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.Qualcomm's data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm's smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs.\"We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level,\" Durga Malladi, Qualcomm's general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week.The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms.Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawThe industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia's chips were used to train OpenAI's GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT.But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services.Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data.The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks.Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm's data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU.\"What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, 'I'm going to mix and match,'\" Malladi said.The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia's Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm's customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power.Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.Qualcomm's design for an AI server called AI200.QualcommStock Chart IconStock chart iconQualcomm one day stock chart.",

Meanwhile, computer giant Oracle recently said it is designing a data center powered by three small nuclear reactors.In addition to bringing more energy online, nuclear energy provides a potential pathway for Big Tech to continue their data center rollout while also curbing carbon emissions. \"[The Google-NextEra partnership] serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy,\" Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, said.Media outlets had taken note when Google, in June, had quietly removed its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 from the main page of its corporate sustainability website amid expansion of its AI plans. Data center projects across the U.S. have also faced growing public pushback. In September, Google withdrew plans for a new data center in Indiana after community groups raised concerns about resource use and environmental impacts, local media reported. On the other hand, Iowa has so far proved receptive to such projects, with Google having invested more than $6.8 billion into data centers in the state. Iowa lawmakers have praised the latest project in the joint release, saying it will support local jobs and energy grids.\"Bringing Duane Arnold back online is a big win for Linn County and the entire state of Iowa,\" State Senator Charlie McClintock said, adding that the announcement shows Iowa can \"keep the lights\" on for residents and businesses.",

Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, meanwhile, traded 14.7% and 9.5% lower, respectively.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News' \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that Washington and Beijing were expected to reach a deal to avoid a new 100% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods, with Beijing set to defer on imposing strict rare earth export controls.His comments come ahead of a high-stakes meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday.Trump on Monday said that the U.S. and China were set to \"come away with\" a trade deal. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan amid a weeklong Asia trip, Trump said that he had \"a lot of respect for President Xi.\"watch nowThe U.S. president had previously threatened to impose new tariffs of 100% on imports from China starting from Nov. 1, adding at the time that the White House would also slap export controls on \"any and all critical software.\"China, for its part, announced a new framework earlier this month for restricting rare earth exports. The move was seen as a stark warning to the West — and a reflection of the deepening mistrust between Beijing and Washington.To be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.\"Details are still limited, and nothing will be finalized until the Trump-Xi meeting,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 26 note.\"But a renewed truce now seems near-certain, with China likely fully delaying their rare earth export controls for a year—better than the alternative of an agreement to grant licenses,\" Marcus said.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersRussia's testing of an \"invincible\" nuclear-powered cruise missile with a potentially \"unlimited range\" has been met with a less-than impressed response from U.S. President Donald Trump as a new cold front opens up between the countries.Russia announced Sunday that it had successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik (or 'Storm Petrel'), on Tuesday last week.It boasted that the missile, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and code-named 'Skyfall' by NATO, can change direction mid-flight and move vertically and horizontally, meaning it can evade missile and air defense systems.President Trump, who's undertaking a whirlwind tour of Asia and is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday, was not impressed with the missile launch, telling reporters Monday that Putin should focus on ending the war in Ukraine instead.\"I don't think its an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying, either, by the way: You ought to get the war ended, the war that should have taken one week is now in ... its fourth year, that's what you ought to do instead of testing missiles,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Monday.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesHe also denigrated the use case for the Russian missile, stating that the U.S. did not need a weapon that could fly so far as it had a nuclear submarine off the coast of Russia.\"They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores, so I mean, it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles,\" Trump said, according to an audio file published by the White House.\"They're not playing games with us and we're not playing games with them either,\" Trump added. \"We test missiles all the time.\"The Kremlin responded to that on Monday by saying that \"Russia is consistently working to ensure its own security. It is in line with this objective that the development of new weapons systems, including the aforementioned [Burevestnik] system, is taking place,\" Putin's Press Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, in comments reported by Russian state media agency TASS.\"Russia must do everything possible to guarantee its own security,\" Peskov added.Test carefully timedThe timing of the test does not appear to be accidental, taking place on the same day that Russia was left humiliated and sidelined after Trump cancelled upcoming talks that were due to be held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.Eager to flex its military muscle, and likely a warning to Trump who has been considering whether to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles capable of striking targets deep within Russia, Moscow declared on Sunday that it had successfully tested its Burevestnik missile.During the test, the missile travelled 14,000 kilometers (or 8,700 miles). It was in the air for about 15 hours and this was \"not the limit,\" Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, told Putin on Sunday, in comments reported by TASS.Putin applauded the test as he visited a command post for troops fighting in Ukraine, where he was briefed on the frontline situation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Sunday.Putin told military officials that such missiles were \"unique products, unmatched anywhere else in the world,\" in comments translated by AP.Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.Grigory Sysoyev | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia says such missiles are part of its nuclear deterrence, with Putin stating Sunday that the country's \"nuclear deterrent is at the highest level. It's probably no exaggeration to say that it's at least higher than that of all nuclear states.\" He added, however, that Russia would now work to put such weapons \"on combat alert.\"On the same day that Russia basked in an apparent show of strength, the Kremlin warned that any strikes inside Russia would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.Souring relationsRelations between Washington and Moscow took a turn for the worse last week after the White House announced that s planned meeting between Putin and Trump would be postponed indefinitely as the White House leader said he didn't want to \"have a wasted meeting.\"Trump added that the in-person summit was canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\"The announcement was met with a stony silence from the Kremlin as senior Russian officials blamed Western media and \"fake news\" for the abandoned talks, which had been previously been lauded by Russian state media as a coup for Moscow as it vies with Ukraine for Trump's ear, and support.",

    "body": "Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier #2 of the Miami Heat.Lachlan Cunningham | Getty ImagesThe National Basketball Association told its 30 teams on Monday that it was instituting a broad review of betting-related issues to \"protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues\" in the wake of a bombshell federal indictment that alleges confidential information about players was leaked to gamblers.In particular, the review will focus on proposition bets offered by legal online sports bookies, which allow gamblers to wager on the statistical performance of individual players, according to a memo from the NBA to its teams, which CNBC obtained.In addition to prop bets, the league will also review how player injuries are reported publicly, and explore ways to improve the use of artificial intelligence and other tools to identify betting patterns that suggest gamblers have access to inside information about players and teams, according to the memo.The memo, from NBA General Counsel Rick Buchanan and Dan Spillane, the league's executive vice president in charge of governance and policy, was addressed to the NBA's board of governors, team presidents, general managers and team counsels.The six people named in the indictment unsealed last week in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, included Miami Heat player Terry Rozier. Rozier and the others are accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.That indictment says the \"defendants and certain co-conspirators had access to private information known by NBA players or NBA coaches, and that this information was shared with others who exploited it to make profitable bets with companies that included FanDuel and DraftKings, the official sports betting partners of the league.Rozier is accused of tipping off a long-time friend in March 2023 while playing for the Charlotte Hornets, that he planned to leave the game early \"due to purported injury.\"The friend and two other men charged in the same indictment then allegedly used that information to make prop bets totaling more than $200,000 that Rozier would underperform in certain areas of play, which could include points scored and assists, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn said Thursday.Rozier left that game after just nine minutes, \"and many of the bets paid off, generating tens of thousands of dollars in profits,\" prosecutors said.Rozier's lawyer, Jim Trusty, has denied the player engaged in wrongdoing, saying, \"Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\"Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The NBA, in its memo on Monday, said, \"While the unusual betting on Terry Rozier's 'unders' in the March 2023 game was detected in real time because the bets were placed legally, we believe there is more that can be done from a legal/regulatory perspective to protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues.\"\"In particular, proposition bets on individual player performance involve heightened integrity concerns and require additional scrutiny,\" the memo said.\"We have also begun a process of reviewing league policies regarding injury reporting, the training and education of all NBA personnel, and safety measures for NBA players,\" the memo said.\"With sports betting now occupying such a significant part of the current sports landscape, every effort must be made to ensure that players, coaches, and other NBA personnel are fully aware of the dire risks that gambling can impose upon their careers and livelihoods; that our injury disclosure rules are appropriate; and that players are protected from harassment from bettors,\" the memo said.\"We also are exploring ways to enhance our existing internal and external integrity monitoring programs to better utilize AI and other tools to synthesize all available data from betting operators, social media, and other sources to identify betting activity of concern,\" the memo said.Portland Trail Blazers Head Coach Chauncey Billups, who is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player, appears to be an unnamed \"Co-conspirator 8\" referred to in the same indictment charging Rozier.Billups is not criminally charged in that case, but details in the indictment describe the NBA playing and coaching career of Co-Conspirator 8, which match those of Billups.The indictment says that Co-Conspirator 8, in March 2023, told a named defendant in the indictment that the Trail Blazers planned to lose a game against the Chicago Bulls to improve the Trail Blazers' chances of getting a better pick in the NBA draft.The Trail Blazers lost that game after people who received the information placed bets with legal online bookmakers totaling about $100,000 that the Trail Blazers would lose, the indictment alleges.Billups is charged in a separate federal indictment in Brooklyn that accuses him of participating in a scheme with alleged Mafia members to swindle unwitting players in underground poker games out of millions of dollars with high-tech cheating device.Billups' lawyer, Chris Heywood, told NBC News last week, \"Chauncey Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.\"Heywood also denied any wrongdoing by Billups in the poker-related indictment, saying, \"Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others.\"Both Billups and Rozier were placed on leave from their teams by the NBA after their arrests on Thursday.In October 2024, after allegations of suspicious betting on the performance of Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter, the NBA directed its gambling partners and other operators to remove prop bets for its lowest-paid players — specifically, those who play on either two-way or 10-day contracts, like Porter had held.The league said at the time that those players may be more vulnerable to manipulation. Porter pleaded guilty in July 2024 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in Brooklyn federal court.Matt King, the CEO of Fanatics Betting and Gaming, told CNBC on Monday that the sports book company maintains constant communication with sports leagues on matters of integrity and regulation.\"When the league asked us not to offer props on two-way contract players … we did that immediately,\" King said.\"It's common sense regulation, it's common sense evolution, and it's a commonsense decision.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on next to people waving Malaysian national flags before he departs on Air Force One from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang on Oct. 27, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to \"come away with\" a trade deal ahead of his expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Japan from Malaysia, Trump added that he could sign a final deal on TikTok as early as Thursday.\"I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and we are going to come away with the deal,\" Trump said.He began his whirlwind weeklong Asia trip on Sunday with a flurry of trade and mineral agreements with his Malaysian and Cambodian counterparts, as well as frameworks for trade pacts with Thailand and Vietnam. The four countries, part of an 11-member regional bloc called the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pledged to remove trade barriers, provide preferential market access to U.S. goods, and increase purchases of American agricultural, energy products, and aircraft.They also agreed to cooperate with Washington on export controls, sanctions and access to critical minerals — commitments that appear to strengthen Trump's standing in a region where Beijing has a growing clout.watch nowWendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute, said that the agreements focused on \"cooperation rather than hard commitments,\" with many important points \"considerably shorter\" than prior U.S. trade agreements.\"The U.S. can impose tariffs or terminate the agreement if it considers Malaysia in violation of commitments,\" Cutler added.In Japan, Trump is expected to meet Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and the emperor before flying to South Korea, capping the trip with a  of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit.Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who also flew in to Malaysia for the 28th China-ASEAN Summit, stopped by Singapore, where he witnessed the signing of eight agreements covering trade and the digital economy.Scant detailsWhile the diplomatic momentum appeared strong, few details were released about the scope of the new trade frameworks.Under the agreements, Washington will keep a 19% tariff rate on most exports from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, while some products will face no duties, according to joint statements from the White House.Tariffs on Vietnam will remain at 20% with some goods eligible for duty-free access, according to the joint statement. Vietnam, which recorded a trade surplus of $123 billion with the U.S. last year, also pledged to step up purchases of American products to address the trade imbalance.Malaysia agreed not to impose bans or quotas on U.S.-bound exports of critical minerals and to speed up development of its rare-earth projects needed by American companies.The country, which sits on an estimated 16.1 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has enforced a nationwide moratorium on the export of unprocessed rare earth materials since last year to develop its downstream industries and prevent resource exploitation.Thailand will ease tariff barriers on U.S. goods by accepting some American-made vehicles, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and by importing ethanol for fuel. It also pledged to relax foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. investors in the telecommunications sector.The agreements left open the possibility of additional product exemptions to be decided later, said Michael Wan, economist at MUFG Bank. He noted that sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and electronics would remain key, as would questions over the legality of Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose them.Peace dealAside from trade agreements, Trump announced the formalization of an extended truce between Thailand and Cambodia, building on a ceasefire that he brokered in July following their violent border clashes this summer.Trump, who has cast himself as a global peace broker, said the deal showed his administration has done \"something that a lot of people said couldn't be done, and we saved maybe millions of lives.\"watch now\"My administration immediately began working to prevent the conflict from escalating,\" Trump said. \"Everybody was sort of amazed that we got it done so quickly.\"Trump-Xi Seoul meetingAs Trump mingled with other leaders in Malaysia, U.S. and Chinese negotiators met on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, where the bilateral talks yielded a framework ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea on Thursday.\"Markets are increasingly getting used to a 'punch-first, negotiate-second' tariffs overture,\" said John Woods, chief investment officer at Lombard Odier.Chinese top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said Sunday that a preliminary consensus had been reached after \"very intense discussions\" on a range of issues, including export controls, fentanyl and shipping fees.The next step, he said, was for both sides to complete their domestic approval procedures.watch nowIn an interview with CBS on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's threat of 100% tariffs is \"effectively off the table\" after a \"very good two-day meeting\" with Chinese officials.Speaking separately to ABC News' \"This Week,\" Bessent said the negotiations produced a \"substantial framework\" that could ease concerns among American soybean farmers over China's boycott.China bought more than half of U.S. soybeans in 2023 and 2024, accounting for nearly $12.8 billion in 2024. But Beijing halted purchases earlier this year after Trump ignited a trade war.Bessent also told ABC News that he expected China to delay its rare earth export controls, set to take effect in the coming weeks, by one year. Trump and Xi could \"consummate\" a deal to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., Bessent added.\"We believe both sides, after testing the other's boundaries, will likely make concessions again,\" said Ting Lu, China economist at Nomura, who expects the additional 100% tariffs on Chinese goods will \"surely not be implemented\" with both sides likely to extend the existing tariff truce.In return, Lu added, Beijing may resume purchases of U.S. soybeans and ease the enforcement of its rare earth export controls.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Federal Reserve is expected to lower borrowing costs again on Wednesday. Another quarter-point reduction, on the heels of September's cut, would bring the federal funds rate to a range between 3.75%-4.00%.The federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves do have a trickle-down effect on many types of consumer loans.The FOMC has also set expectations for another reduction in December, but after that, the path is unclear. President Donald Trump — who has said a pick to replace current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could come by the end of the year — has repeatedly weighed in on Fed policy, arguing that rates should be sharply lower.It's not a given that rates will continue to fall, and even if they do, not all consumer products are affected equally.'The Fed is not cutting every single interest rate'When the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023, the interest rates on most consumer loans quickly followed suit. Even though this would be the second rate cut in a row, many of those consumer rates are likely to stay higher, for now.\"The Fed is not cutting every single interest rate that exists in the world,\" said Mike Pugliese, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics.Depending on their duration, some borrowing rates are more sensitive to Fed changes than others, he said: \"At one end of the spectrum, you have shorter floating rates, and on the other end, you have a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.\"Those shorter-term rates are more closely pegged to the prime rate, which is the rate that banks extend to their most creditworthy customers — typically 3 percentage points higher than the federal funds rate. Longer-term rates are also influenced by inflation and other economic factors.Credit cards won't 'go from awful to amazing overnight'Olga Rolenko | Moment | Getty ImagesAccording to Bankrate, nearly half of American households have credit card debt and pay more than 20% in interest, on average, on their revolving balances — making credit cards one of the most expensive ways to borrow money.Since most credit cards have a short-term, variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark.When the Fed lowers rates, the prime rate comes down, too, and the interest rate on your credit card debt is likely to adjust within a billing cycle or two. But even then, credit card APRs will only ease off extremely high levels. And generally, card issuers have kept their rates somewhat elevated to mitigate their exposure to riskier borrowers.  \"Even if the Fed steps on the gas in the coming months when it comes to rate cuts, credit card rates aren't going to go from awful to amazing overnight,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief credit analyst. Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessGovernment shutdown curtails nonprofit funding, putting services in jeopardyMore investors are interested in alts — advisors say there's an easy way inHere's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chartInherited IRAs have a key change for 2025.

Going forward, \"a modest Fed rate cut won't dramatically slash monthly payments for consumers,\" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, previously told CNBC, \"but it does boost overall buyer sentiment.\"watch nowLonger-term loans, like mortgages, are less impacted by the Fed. Both 15- and 30-year mortgage rates are more closely tied to Treasury yields and the economy. Still, expectations of more cuts down the road could put some downward pressure on mortgage rates, experts say, and that may \"spur more Americans to consider jumping back into the housing market after sitting on the sidelines for so long,\" according to LendingTree's Schulz.Other home loans are more closely tied to the Fed's moves. Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, and home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, are pegged to the prime rate. Most ARMs adjust once a year, but a HELOC adjusts right away.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

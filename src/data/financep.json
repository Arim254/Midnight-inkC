    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe European Commission on Monday said it opened an investigation into Elon Musk's X over the spreading of sexually explicit material by the AI chatbot Grok. The probe is being conducted under the European Union's sweeping Digital Services Act (DSA) regulation. \"The new investigation will assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok's functionalities into X in the EU,\" the Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.\"This includes risks related to the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material.\"The Commission said the risks \"seem to have materialised, exposing citizens in the EU to serious harm.\"\"Deepfakes are a troubling, frontier issue that call for tailored, thoughtful responses,\" U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers told CNBC. \"Erecting a 'Great Firewall' to ban X, or lobotomizing AI, is neither tailored nor thoughtful. We stand ready to work with the EU on better ideas.\"Grok came under fire this year after users were able to prompt the system to generate sexualized images of children and other individuals.Earlier this month, Musk's company said it had \"implemented technological measures\" to prevent the Grok account on X \"from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.\" The company also limited image creation editing through Grok on X to paid subscribers. The standalone Grok app, which does not share images publicly, still allowed non-paying users to generate imagery of women and children.European regulators have joined a growing list of authorities looking into Grok. The U.K., India, and Malaysia are among a number of other countries investigating the sexualized imagery generated by Grok.X has been in the crosshairs of the European Commission under the DSA, which gives the regulator the ability to levy large fines on tech companies. The DSA is designed to regulate online platforms, their content, and behavior with consumers. On Monday, the Commission said it is extending an investigation that began in 2023 into X and its recommendation system. In December, the Commission fined X 120 million euros ($142.3 million) for breaching its transparency obligations under the DSA. - CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Kai Nicol-Schwarz contributed to this report.

    "body": "Sign at the entrance to a Target store in Venice, Florida. Erik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTarget's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke told employees Monday that the \"violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful,\" following the second fatal shooting by federal agents in the company's hometown of Minneapolis in recent weeks.\"I know it's weighing heavily on many of you across the country, as it is with me,\" he said in a video message sent to the big-box retailer's workforce. \"What's happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target.\"In the video, Fiddelke did not name the two U.S. citizens killed in the shootings, Renee Good or Alex Pretti, describe the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the enforcement surge in Minneapolis or call for any specific policy changes. He also did not mention President Donald Trump or his administration.Corporations and CEOs largely stayed silent throughout the deployment of thousands of federal agents in Minneapolis and the killing of Good by an ICE agent earlier this month. Yet even before Saturday's deadly shooting, public opinion polls reflected concerns about the Trump administration's tactics, with 61% of respondents to a New York Times/Siena poll taken after Good's death saying ICE's tactics had gone too far.Thousands of people have marched in the streets of Minneapolis in sub-zero winter temperatures to protest ICE actions. And on Friday, many local businesses shuttered for an event called \"Day of Truth and Freedom,\" which was organized and backed by local faith leaders.More than 60 Minnesota business leaders, including Fiddelke, signed a letter on Sunday calling for an \"immediate deescalation of tensions\" after Pretti's killing. That message also did not specifically mention the shootings or Trump.Target's Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will take over as CEO from Brian Cornell.Courtesy of TargetFiddelke, Target's chief operating officer, will step into the CEO role on Feb. 1. In the video message to employees, he said he's looking forward to starting the job in a week and \"this isn't the first message I imagined I'd send.\"He said he's \"been meeting with a range of leaders and this weekend added my signature to a statement using our collective voice to call for calm, constructive dialogue and deescalation to reduce tension and keep people safe as that work continues.\"Read the full transcript of Fiddelke's video here:Hi team. In one week I will officially start as CEO. We're about to step into a new chapter for Target, and I've been looking forward to starting this work with you for some time, but this isn't the first message I imagined I'd send. We'll have time to talk very soon about our plans to move Target forward, but right now, as someone who is raising a family here in the Twin Cities and as a leader of this hometown company, I want to acknowledge where we are. The violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful. I know it's weighing heavily on many of you across the country, as it is with me. What's happening affects us not just as a company, but as people, as neighbors, friends and family members within Target. We are doing everything we can to manage what's in our control, always keeping the safety of our team and guests our top priority. During my more than 20 years at Target, one of the things I've loved is how we are part of the communities where we operate. Since the beginning, we've given 5% of our profits and millions of volunteer hours to make them strong and vibrant places to live and work. In line with that, I've been meeting with a range of leaders and this weekend added my signature to a statement using our collective voice to call for calm, constructive dialogue and deescalation to reduce tension and keep people safe.As that work continues, looking ahead to next week, I'll spend my first days in the field listening and learning alongside our teams, and then we'll come together for an all-team huddle to talk about how we're moving our business forward. Our leadership team is activated, HR is equipped, and our resources remain ready to give you the care and support you need. Thank you for everything you do for each other, our guests, and our communities.",

New York, U.S., January 25, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. natural gas prices surged above $6 for the first time since late 2022 on Monday as a huge winter storm swept across the country, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and forcing mass flight cancellations.Natural gas futures for February delivery traded 17.7% higher, or 93 cents, to $6.21 per million British thermal units at 11:46 a.m. London time (6:46 a.m. ET), notching a new 52-week high.It is the first time the contract, which is up around 68% year-to-date, has climbed above the $6 level since Dec. 2022, when European demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas soared following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year. More than 822,000 customers were left without power in the wake of a massive winter storm late Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, which collects real-time power outage data from utilities nationwide.The big freeze, known as Winter Storm Fern, was forecast to bring widespread heavy snow and \"catastrophic ice accumulations\" from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), affecting at least 180 million people in 37 states. Wind chills as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit (-45.56 degrees Celsius) will persist across the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. this week, the NWS said in a social media post on Sunday, with temperatures far below normal expected to continue into early February.  The extreme cold has been blamed for the deaths of seven people nationwide, NBC News reported, citing local officials. More than 12,500 flights were canceled in the U.S. on Sunday, FlightAware reported, with a further 3,965 canceled so far on Monday. Delta Air Lines, which had previously urged travelers to rebook flights, said Sunday that it intended to operate a reduced schedule as icy conditions disrupted operations.An American Airlines plane at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) during a winter storm in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Energy on Monday issued two emergency orders to mitigate blackouts in New England and Texas, seeking to keep grids stable and minimize the risk of blackouts.\"As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions across the country, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power is non-negotiable,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a statement on Monday. Power outages are estimated to cost the U.S. about $44 billion per year, according to data from the DOE's National Laboratories. ",

    "body": "Gold notched another record high on Friday, while silver and platinum also extended gains to hit all-time peaks, driven by reduced confidence in U.S. assets.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGold climbed to a fresh all-time high, crossing $5,100 an ounce on Monday and extending its record-breaking run as investors seek the safety of the yellow metal amid rising geopolitical tensions and global fiscal risks.Spot gold prices gained 2.4%, trading at $5,102 an ounce, before slightly paring gains to last trade at $5,086. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures for February rose 2.1%, reaching $5,087 an ounce. The precious metal's surge comes as recent flashpoints from Greenland and Venezuela to the Middle East underscore higher geopolitical risk, reinforcing gold's appeal as a hedge against uncertainty.\"The recent further leg up in gold and silver prices has arrived on the back of geoeconomics issues related to Greenland,\" HSBC wrote in a note last week.Silver also rallied Monday, with spot prices jumping 4.9% to $107.9 per ounce, also benefiting from industrial demand.Analysts at Union Bancaire Privée said Friday that prices have rallied on the back of sustained demand from both institutional and retail buyers.watch now\"We anticipate that gold should enjoy another strong year, reflecting ongoing central bank and retail investment demand, with a year-end target price of USD 5,200 per ounce,\" UBP said.Goldman Sachs sees the demand base for gold to have broadened beyond traditional channels. Western ETF holdings have climbed by about 500 tonnes since the start of 2025, while newer instruments used to hedge macro-policy risks, including physical purchases by high-net-worth families, have become an increasingly important source of demand.The investment bank recently lifted its December 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 an ounce, up from $4,900 previously, arguing that hedges against global macro and policy risks have become \"sticky,\" effectively lifting the starting point for gold prices this year.Central bank purchases also remain robust. Goldman estimates central-bank purchases are now averaging around 60 tonnes a month, far above the pre-2022 average of 17 tonnes, with emerging-market central banks continuing to shift reserves into gold.Crucially, the bank assumes that hedges against global macro-policy risks, including concerns around fiscal sustainability, will remain in place through 2026, unlike election-related hedges that unwound quickly after the U.S. vote in late 2024.\"We assume that hedges of global macro policy risks remain stable as these perceived risks (e.g. fiscal sustainability) may not fully resolve in 2026,\" Goldman said last week.",

    "body": "watch nowCanada has \"no intention\" of pursuing a free trade deal with China, Prime Minister Mark Carney said, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Ottawa.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Carney said that the country respects its obligations under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade agreement, known as CUSMA in Canada and the USMCA in the U.S., and will not pursue a free trade agreement without notifying the other two parties. Carney's remarks come after Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff on Canadian exports if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with Beijing. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday.The remarks come against the backdrop of rising tensions between the U.S. and Canada, with Trump last week withdrawing the invitation to Ottawa to join his \"Board of Peace,\" after Carney in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos warned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.While Carney did not name any country, Trump said on the sidelines of the WEF that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"    Trump's fiery rhetoric on Truth Social contrasts with what he said after the agreement between Ottawa and Beijing earlier this month, \"that's what he [Carney] should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also echoed Trump's sentiments on Canada and China, telling ABC News on Sunday that the U.S could not \"let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.\"On Jan. 16, Ottawa and Beijing concluded a \"preliminary agreement,\"  with both sides lowering tariffs on select goods. Under the agreement, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the market annually at a lowered tariff rate of 6.1%, after raising tariffs on such vehicles to 100% in October 2024 in conjunction with the U.S. In return, Beijing will cut duties on Canadian agricultural exports, including on canola seed oil, which will see tariffs drop to 15% from March 1, down from the current 85%. Other exports, such as Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas will also not be subject to Chinese anti-discrimination tariffs until at least the end of 2026.Carney said Sunday: \"What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that have developed in the last couple of years,\" adding that the deal was \"entirely consistent with CUSMA.\"In August 2025, Trump raised tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25%. Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under CUSMA, but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.

The killings have stoked massive protests, heated denunciations of ICE from Democrats and pleas for de-escalation from business leaders.Trump's decision to give Homan control in Minnesota comes as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials face mounting criticism, including from gun rights groups and some conservatives, over their leadership and rhetoric in Minneapolis.Fox News reported Sunday that some senior officials involved in immigration enforcement have \"grown increasingly uneasy & frustrated [with] some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed\" following the latest shooting.Axios reported last month that Noem and Homan have a tense and acrimonious working relationship. Trump has praised both officials.watch nowNoem, in a statement on X, said Trump's decision to tap Homan for Minnesota is \"good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.\" \"I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,\" Noem said.\"We continue to call on the leadership in Minnesota to allow for state and local partnership in our public safety mission,\" she said.Tensions in Minnesota have boiled over after the two killings by federal agents in Minneapolis.Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7 as she began to drive her SUV after another agent ordered her out of the car.On Saturday, Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by federal officers.Both killings occurred in daylight in front of witnesses and were caught on video from multiple angles, massively ratcheting up the already-intense scrutiny over immigration agents' tactics and training.In both cases, numerous Trump administration officials rushed to defend the agents' actions as justified, while making claims about the incidents that later analyses found were contradicted by the available video evidence.Protesters hold a vigil for Alex Pretti, the man fatally shot by federal immigration enforcement the previous day in Minneapolis, United States, on January 25, 2026.Arthur Maiorella | Anadolu | Getty ImagesOn the same day that Pretti was killed, DHS claimed that he approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a handgun and, after they attempted to disarm him, \"violently resisted.\"Noem echoed that statement. Later, Greg Bovino, Border Patrol commander at large, claimed Pretti may have been intending to \"massacre law enforcement.\"But videos show Pretti holding up a phone as the confrontation begins. And the clips also appear to show one officer removing a weapon from Pretti's person prior to any shots being fired.Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry his weapon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference.Trump, asked by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday if he believed shooting Pretti was the right thing to do, did not directly answer.\"We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,\" Trump told the newspaper.",

    "body": "watch nowTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration needs two more days to fully recover from the significant flight disruptions that came over the weekend due to the massive winter storm that swept across the country.In an interview Monday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Duffy said the FAA is targeting Wednesday as the day it hopes flights will return to normal.\"This storm is unique,\" Duffy said. \"You get the ice and you get the snow and, on top of that, we have now a cold weather snap that comes after it. ... So it makes it more challenging to navigate the ice that's going over the last three days.\"Sunday marked the largest flight cancellation day since early 2020, when the Covid pandemic hit. Airlines canceled more than 15,000 U.S. flights over the weekend, according to flight tracking website FlightAware, as much of the country was covered in snow and ice.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDuffy said the \"massive disruption\" was continuing Monday as the U.S. Department of Transportation deals with the fallout of the storm, with more than 4,000 flight cancellations for the day and nearly 10,000 delays. Those disruptions come as the FAA focuses on salting and clearing runways while dealing with lower staffing because commuting is difficult for workers, Duffy added.There are only 48 U.S. cancellations so far for Tuesday, according to FlightAware, largely a normal operation.\"We're going to have more capacity as we come back to a full running schedule,\" Duffy said. \"So you'll expect more full planes, more full flights as you fly this week, just as people are going to their destinations. But again, Wednesday is our target date to get back to normal.\"More than 2,700 flights are canceled at the one of the three major New York City area airports, LaGuardia, as deadly Winter Storm Fern hit the Tri-State Area in New York, United States on January 25, 2026.Selcuk Acar | Anadolu | Getty ImagesAirlines routinely cancel flights ahead of a major storm to make sure that planes, passengers and crew don't get stranded, which can make disruptions even worse after severe weather clears. January is a low season for travel, but the massive winter storm was affecting travel for hundreds of thousands of people.Multiple air carriers, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, said they are waiving cancellation fees for customers to rebook. The winter storm cancellations come just weeks after parts of the Caribbean airspace were closed following the U.S. attacks in Venezuela.— CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Michael Intrator, CEO of Coreweave, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20th, 2026. Oscar Molina | CNBCShares of CoreWeave popped 12% on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider.Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $87.20 per share, according to a release, a discount from Friday's closing price of $92.98. The investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of \"5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030,\" the companies said. \"This deal allows us to accelerate our build, which will lead to continued diversification and reducing dependency on any particular client as we scale into this additional data center capacity,\" CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Monday.A gigawatt is a measure of power that's becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity. Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.\"The thing to remember is we've invested $2 billion into CoreWeave, but recognize that the amount of funding that needs to be raised yet to support that five gigawatts is really quite significant,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC during the interview. \"We're investing a small percentage of the amount that ultimately has to go and be provided.\"CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a \"neocloud,\" has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners.Prior to Monday's announcement, Nvidia was already a major CoreWeave backer.

Nvidia has an obligation to buy the \"residual unsold capacity through April 2032, according to the agreement. CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity, including from Nvidia.\"We're in the beginning of the AI infrastructure build out, and the demand is just extraordinary,\" Huang said on Monday.As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure, CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.But CoreWeave's stock has been shaky in recent months as some investors worry that the company is taking on high levels of debt to finance those multibillion-dollar deals. Intrator told CNBC earlier this month that AI will eventually be embedded into \"absolutely everything we do,\" and that the technology will \"continue to pay dividends over the next 100 years.\" \"What you're seeing is the base-load infrastructure being built right now at what has historically been a pace that wasn't even considered,\" he said. \"Companies like CoreWeave, and there are others, are out there building the infrastructure to be able to deliver that for these clients.\"PRO: Watch CNBC's full interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator",

The Build conference, marking its second consecutive year in Seattle, is expected to put emphasis on the company's cloud technologies and the artificial intelligence features within those services.Grant Hindsley | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft announced the next generation of its artificial intelligence chip, a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google.The Maia 200 comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post Monday that, for the new chip, there will be \"wider customer availability in the future.\" Guthrie called the Maia 200 \"the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed.\" Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit.Microsoft said its superintelligence team, led by Mustafa Suleyman, will use the new chip. The Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software bundles and the Microsoft Foundry service, for building on top of AI models, will use it as well.Cloud providers face surging demand from generative AI model developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI and from companies building AI agents and other products on top of the popular models. Data center operators and infrastructure providers are trying to increase their computing prowess while keeping power consumption in check. Microsoft is outfitting its U.S. Central region of data centers with Maia 200 chips, and they'll arrive at the U.S. West 3 region after that, with additional locations to follow. The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s 3 nanometer process. Four are connected together inside each server. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition.The chip offers 30% higher performance than alternatives for the same price, Guthrie wrote. Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google's seventh-generation tensor processing unit.Microsoft can achieve high performance by wiring up to 6,144 of the Maia 200 chips together, reducing energy usage and total cost of ownership, Guthrie wrote.In 2023, Microsoft demonstrated that its GitHub Copilot coding assistant could run on Maia 100 processors.WATCH: Chinese AI models adapt without Nvidiawatch now",

    "body": "watch nowUSA Rare Earth shares rallied Monday after the critical minerals startup announced that the Department of Commerce will take an equity stake. Commerce has issued a letter of intent that would provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding. USA Rare Earth will issue Commerce 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants. The U.S. government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company depending on whether the warrants are exercised, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. USA Rare Earth also raised $1.5 billion from private investors. The proposed deal with Commerce is subject to finalization of agreements and approvals. CEO Barbara Humpton said the deal with the U.S. government will turn USA Rare Earth into an industry leader. Its stock soared more than 20% after the announcement Monday. \"This is a watershed moment in our work to secure and grow a resilient and independent rare earth value chain based in this country,\" Humpton told analysts on a call Monday. \"We have long said that meeting the urgent call to reassure the rare earth and critical minerals industry will require a multiplayer solution, and this establishes our company as one of the leaders,\" she said. USA Rare Earth is the latest in a series of mining companies that the Trump administration has taken equity stakes in as it builds a Western rare earth and critical minerals supply chain to reduce dependence on China. Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs in strategic industries like defense, robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing.The capital infusion from the Trump administration will help USA Rare Earth advance its plan to build a magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and a mine at a rare earth deposit in Sierra Blanca, Texas, called Round Top. Commerce will disburse the funding from 2026 through 2028 based on milestones as USA Rare Earth implements its business plan, Chief Financial Officer Rob Steele told analysts on the call.USA Rare Earth is on track to commission its magnet manufacturing plant in the first quarter of 2026, Steele said. It aims to start commercial mining operations at Round Top in late 2028, he said. The company needs about about $4.1 billion to execute its plan, Steele said. It will have about $3.5 billion between its current cash and the government financing as well as private funding announced Monday, he said. This leaves $600 million in additional capital that USA Rare Earth needs to raise. \"We believe we can raise the remaining capital from attractive sources, and you should assume that's equity capital but that can come from strategic investments as well as institutional investors,\" Steele said. The Trump administration struck a landmark deal last year with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. It also took stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals.The agreement with USA Rare Earth does not include price floors or offtake agreements. The U.S. has been dependent on rare earth imports from China, which dominates the global supply chain. Beijing tried to cut off rare earth exports last year during trade disputes with the Trump administration.",

    "body": "Nvidia and Alphabet's VC arms have backed British AI startup Synthesia in a $200 million funding round, amid a surge of private investment in promising young tech companies seeking to capitalize on the AI boom.The round sees Synthesia hit a $4 billion valuation and was led by Alphabet's GV, with participation from Evantic, Hedosophia, Nvidia's NVentures, Accel, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Air Street Capital. It nearly doubles the price tag the startup hit a year ago, when it picked up $180 million in funding, and a valuation of $2.1 billion.Synthesia develops video generation tools for enterprises to be used for internal and external communications. Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia's cofounder and CEO, in a statement, that the funding round was \"about scaling\" its vision of AI reducing the cost of content creation, and AI video providing \"a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn.\"\"We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI Agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,\" he added.watch nowAs part of the raise, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary share sale in partnership with NASDAQ at a $4 billion valuation.Europe's AI startups raised a record $21.4 billion in private funding in 2025, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. U.S. AI companies picked up $162.7 billion that year, but that includes around $70 billion raised by just three companies, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. That momentum has continued in 2026. In recent weeks, CNBC reported that OpenAI is in talks with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East for a round that could total around $50 billion, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a new $10 billion round and xAI raised $20 billion.Synthesia's fresh funding will see it double down on its rollout of agentic capabilities within the videos its AI creates, which allows users to interact with them in real time.The AI video means employees can explore scenarios through role-play and receive tailored explanations rather than passively consuming training materials, the company said.Founded in 2017, Synthesia has become one of the most talked-about AI startups in the UK tech sector and has courted politicians as it looks to expand. Both London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the then Tech Minister Peter Kyle were present for the company's new office opening in July.\"Synthesia is a UK success story, creating new jobs and opportunities in this country,\" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. \"It shows that by backing innovators to start, scale and stay in the UK through better access to finance and generous tax reliefs, we can turn the promise of AI into better-paid jobs and long-term growth across the UK.\"Synthesia has hit $150 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and expects to pass the $200 million mark sometime in 2026, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Kim told CNBC.",

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowChances for a partial shutdown of the U.S. government by the end of this week grew on Sunday due to outrage over federal immigration agents fatally shooting Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the second such incident this month.A growing chorus of Democratic senators warned that they will not vote for a massive $1.2 trillion package to fund federal government operations if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement efforts.On Sunday, a person familiar with the thinking of the Senate's Republican leadership told CNBC that they will not remove the DHS funding portion, despite that warning.\"Government funding expires at the end of the week, and Republicans are determined to not have another government shutdown,\" that person said.\"We will move forward as planned and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,\" they said.The House of Representatives on Thursday approved the funding package.Without Senate approval of the deal by Friday, the federal government will begin a partial shutdown.The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure.The deadly shooting of Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday morning ignited already simmering concern among members of the Democratic caucuses in Congress about funding DHS. Democrats already were angry about the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman, by an ICE officer in that city on Jan. 7.\"Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement on Sunday.\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" he said. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"Sen. Angus King of Maine told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, \"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] funding under these circumstances.\"\"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem,\" said King, one of two independents who caucuses with Democrats. \"We don't have to have a shutdown,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosKing played a key role in ending last year's 43-day shutdown.  He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.Members of the House, which went into a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would have to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It is unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or would do so. Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes appropriations for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury. \"No, I am not voting for this funding,\" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.\"The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier last week that the \"suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.\"\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said on X Saturday.\"I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate — Republicans must work with us to do that,\" she said.It was unclear if the Senate could split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. It remains possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats. DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law passed last summer. But that is far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end the record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.\"I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,\" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown.\"Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"  Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this article.",

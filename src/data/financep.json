    "body": "For founders hoping to build a business that will last for decades, the key to unlocking lasting success is to never stop thinking like a startup, according to investor and author Eric Becker.\"It's a little bit counterintuitive. Most people associate something that lasts over time as becoming bureaucratic, slow-moving, indecisive,\" says Becker, co-founder and co-chairman of Cresset Capital, a Chicago-based wealth management firm with more than $70 billion in assets under management. Becker has started or invested in more than 100 companies, he says.The \"long-game companies,\" as Becker calls them, are typically \"more nimble\" than their competitors, which allows them to better navigate the inevitable ups and downs of running a business. Leaders of those companies have to be able to weather difficult stretches while looking ahead to predict shifting markets. Then, they must take decisive action to come up with fresh ideas that can set their companies up for continued success.Those lasting businesses have \"the ability to really see into the future where things are going [and] take action when action is needed,\" Becker adds. \"They actually are all of the things that you think of in a small, fast-moving startup.\"Resilience becomes part of your company's DNAOne example of a continuously innovative mindset: The J.M. Smucker Company, Becker writes his book, \"The Long Game: A Playbook of the World's Most Enduring Companies,\" which published on Oct. 14. Founded by an Ohio farmer in 1897, the company has grown from selling apple butter from a horse-drawn wagon to a packaged food operation currently valued at more than $11 billion. It owns brands making everything from jam, coffee and desserts to pet food. One of its current biggest revenue producers is the Uncrustables brand of frozen peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches, which launched in 1998 and is expected to top $1 billion in annual sales by 2026, the company said in 2024.\"Smucker's has been able to adapt and tap into consumer needs and market trends, transforming simple concepts into widely recognized and beloved products,\" Becker wrote in his book. Like many other large businesses, J.M. Smucker also likely benefits from its scale and resources by using preexisting relationships with retailers to get products into stores across the country.Still, businesses that can consistently and successfully reinvent themselves show a \"level of resiliency [that] becomes part of the DNA of the company,\" Becker says.Some founders and executives are simply too stubborn, or short-sighted, to deviate from a failing strategy before it is too late, Shanaz Hemmati, a veteran of two multibillion-dollar startups, said in October.\"Being able to, or being willing to, change if something is not working, [doing it] very quickly and trying different things,\" Hemmati said. \"I think that is a big difference between those who do succeed versus those who [do not].\"Confront reality and trust your gutBecker's advice for leaders — on how to cultivate and hone the ability to identify potentials issue that need to be addressed — starts with a simple gut-check question: \"What am I tolerating but shouldn't be?\"Regularly asking that question \"forces us to confront our reality every day,\" which any successful business must do to assess potential pain points that could hurt their business now or on the horizon, he says.Once you've identified pain points, move thoughtfully and decisively to come up with solutions, Becker recommends. That could mean identifying an employee or team that is underperforming and making a plan to move on from them, or recognizing that an antiquated business model that requires new ideas.Often, identifying a nascent issue before it grows into a much larger problem \"starts with this sense that you have that something's not right,\" says Becker, adding: \"When I look back at mistakes that I made in business, [in nearly every case] I had a sense in my gut, and I didn't listen.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "With the average price of a new car now topping $50,000, more buyers are stretching out their loan terms to lower the monthly payment.The average loan length is now 69 months, with the share of 84-month loans at 22% — a record high, according to data from automotive research firm Edmunds. A 60-month term is Edmunds' recommended cap, but that's become less realistic for many buyers dealing with higher prices that have made shorter terms harder to afford.While longer loan terms can keep monthly costs down, they can also end up costing more overall and come with other downsides worth considering. Here's a look at some of the trade-offs.Higher overall costStretching out a car loan term can lower the monthly payment, but it also raises the total amount of interest you'll pay. For a $50,000 new car with a 10% down payment and the current average percentage rate of 7%, the added cost looks like this:48 months: Monthly payment of $1,078 and $6,724 in total interest60 months: Monthly payment of $891 and $8,463 in total interest84 months: Monthly payment of $679 and $12,050 in total interestAn 84-month loan term ends up costing $5,326 more in interest than a 48-month option.While this example uses a single APR for comparison, it's important to consider that the annual percentage rate for longer loans tends to be higher than shorter loans, says Ezra Peterson, vice president of auto app Way.com. It's \"often nearly a full point and a half higher,\" he says.Another risk is that \"setting a budget based on monthly payments enables buying more car than people actually need,\" says Justin Fischer, an automotive analyst at CarEdge.com, a car-shopping website. By only focusing on the monthly cost, buyers might overlook how quickly the total interest adds up. You'll be in debt longerA longer loan term can leave less room in your budget down the line, especially since you may not know what your expenses will look like by the time the loan is halfway paid off.\"The longer time in debt is my biggest concern,\" says Robert Persichitte, a certified financial planner at Delagify Financial. \"When you are still paying off a car long after the warranty expires, you are at risk of paying for repairs and other issues while still paying off your car. That one-two punch is going to be a big hit for most budgets.\"A long payoff timeline also means you have less flexibility if your income changes, if you need to replace the car sooner than expected or if other financial needs come up.Depreciation is a bigger riskNew cars depreciate quickly, which can create added risk for buyers with longer loan terms.If you need to sell the vehicle after it has lost value, or you \"total the car in an accident in the first few years of a 72-month loan, insurance coverage or sale proceeds may not cover the remaining balance,\" says Fischer.While gap insurance — which covers the difference between a car's value and what's left on the loan — can help offset the cost, \"in some situations, this leaves drivers owing money on a car they no longer drive,\" Fischer says.By extending the loan term, a longer payoff period can \"increase the window where borrowers are underwater,\" Fischer says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "If I tell you that I'm a successful entrepreneur who runs a thriving business, you might picture an always-on founder who works late into the night and regularly puts in overtime. But I've built up sustainable passive income streams and work just four hours a day.As a content creator, I make videos about productivity and brand-building. I've also written three books, sell products, and offer courses and coaching. But I don't want to spend 100 hours a week working at the expense of time to travel, write, or be with my husband and two young daughters.About five years into my career, I started auditing my time to identify and reduce waste.Here are six time-wasting habits I quit so I could level up my life:1. I quit taking every meetingI live in this amazing world where lots of awesome people want to talk to me, call me, meet with me, hire me. But if I took every single meeting, I'd get nothing else done.When I get a meeting invitation, I don't just click yes right away. I look to see: Do we have an agenda? Is that agenda important to me? Have we discussed this already?If I decide a meeting doesn't align with my priorities or could be handled better with an email exchange, I let the organizer know that it wasn't a fit for my current priorities or there needed to be a more specific agenda for the time commitment. I love looking at a clean, intentional calendar every day. 2. I quit working without time blocksIf I have to do something, it's blocked off on my calendar. On a given day, I might have a two-hour block to schedule my next three months of video content creation and a two-hour block to write an article like this one.This forces me to prioritize what I'll focus on and agree to give it my full energy. I usually have no more than two, maybe three, time blocks per day so I can give everything the attention it deserves. It makes me — and my work — better.3. I quit saying yes to everythingI used to say yes to every podcast interview, coffee chat, and collaboration request. I thought that's what you had to do to build a business. But I was exhausted and my work was suffering.Now, when someone asks me to participate in something, I check if it aligns with my current goals. Last month alone, I said no to three podcast interviews that would have taken hours of prep time. I used those hours to create content for my YouTube channel and work on my next book.As a result, the people who matter most respect my time more, and I respect myself more, too.4. I quit social media scrollingAbout two years ago, I realized I was spending 90 minutes a day mindlessly scrolling Instagram and TikTok. That's 10.5 hours a week I could be writing or spending with my daughters.The first thing I did was turn off all my notifications. Then I moved social media apps off my phone's home screen so I'd have to intentionally search for them. Now my phone stays out of my bedroom at night, and the first thing I look at in the morning is a note with my goals — not Instagram.I still use social media for my business, but I'm intentional about it. I check it twice a day for 15 minutes each time, and I curate my feed to only show content that energizes me.5. I quit starting my day reactivelyI used to wake up, grab my phone, and immediately start responding to emails and texts. By 8 a.m., I was already stressed and behind.Now I start every day with what I call my three buckets: Movement: I do 20 minutes of stretching or hit the gym.Mindfulness: I journal or read for 15 minutes. Mastery: I spend 30 minutes on whatever I'm trying to master — right now, it's learning Spanish.This routine takes just over an hour, but it means I start my workday at 9 a.m. feeling energized and focused instead of frazzled. I don't check email until after I've completed all three buckets.6. I quit consuming without creatingThree years ago, I'd spend entire evenings watching YouTube videos about content creation and business strategy, but I wasn't actually creating anything myself. I felt stuck and behind.Now I have a strict rule: I don't consume any content unless I've already created something that day. Before I watch anything, I need to have written, filmed, or planned my own content first.This shift completely changed my mindset. When I do consume content now, I see it as inspiration rather than a sign I'm falling behind. Last year alone, this habit helped me publish dozens of YouTube videos and write my third book.Amy Landino is the bestselling author of Good Morning Good Life, personal brand coach and the award-winning creator of AmyTV on YouTube.

    "body": "Flag of China and LGBT rainbow flagAlxeypnferov | Istock | Getty ImagesApple has confirmed that it has removed two popular gay dating apps from its Chinese iOS Store, following an order from Beijing's main internet regulator and censorship authority.It comes following reports of the apps — Blued and Finka — suddenly disappearing from the iOS App Store over the weekend. In a statement shared with CNBC, Apple confirmed that it was behind the action and defended the company's position, stating that it must follow the laws of the countries where it operates.\"Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,\" the company said, though they clarified that the apps had already been unavailable in other countries.However, a \"lite\" version of the Blued app is still available for download on the China App Store, CNBC confirmed Tuesday. The Wire had been the first to report that Apple had made the move at Beijing's order.The disappearance of Blued and Finka is the latest example of China's crackdown on app stores in recent years.Grindr, a popular gay dating app from the U.S., was removed from the iOS store in 2022, days after the Cyberspace Administration of China began a crackdown on content it considered illegal and inappropriate. Later in 2023, Beijing announced new policies requiring all apps serving local users to register with the government and receive licenses. That move had resulted in a wave of foreign apps being removed from iOS. The following years have also seen regulators continue to appeal directly to companies like Apple to remove certain apps due to issues with their content. In April 2024, Apple removed Meta's WhatsApp and Threads from iOS following an order from the CAC, citing national security concerns.Apple has proven a willingness to comply with these requests in China, which represents its largest oversea market outside the U.S.The takedown of Blued and Finka also likely reflects increasing crackdowns and censorship of the LGBTQ community in China. In recent years, the government has shuttered major advocacy groups, including the Beijing LGBT Center. While homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, same-sex marriage remains unrecognized.  — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Paramount Global and Skydance logos are seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. Dado Ruvic | ReutersParamount Skydance said on Monday it expects $1 billion more in merger savings than it previously forecast as it outlines CEO David Ellison's ambitions for the company.The update came in Paramount's third-quarter earnings report — the company's first since its merger closed in early August. Ellison has been investing heavily in streaming and content, including live sports rights, and paying for it in part with cuts to other parts of the business.Paramount on Monday noted layoffs affecting roughly 1,600 employees, tied to divestitures of assets in Argentina and Chile. Late last month, Paramount began the process to lay off another approximately 1,000 employees.At the same time, Paramount said it plans to increase prices for its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, in the first quarter of next year as it looks to beef up its content slate and improve its the technology of the platform.Paramount last raised its streaming prices in June 2024, after a previous hike in early 2023.Shares of the company were up about 6% in extended trading Monday.Cutting to growIn Monday's letter to shareholders, Ellison mapped out the combined company's initiatives, which he referred to as Paramount Skydance's \"North Star priorities.\" Those include investing in its growth businesses, growing its streaming business globally and identifying savings that would lead to \"long-term free cash flow generation.\"While Paramount Skydance management told investors in August they planned $2 billion in cost savings, that was upped to \"at least $3 billion in run-rate efficiencies\" as of Monday's report. More than $1.4 billion of those savings will be done by the end of the year and an additional $1 billion by the end of 2026, according to the letter.The company has been shedding staff. Less than a month after the merger was completed, the company alerted employees that it would be mandating a five-day work week beginning in January and would offer employees a buyout if they didn't want to make the transition. According to Monday's letter, about 600 employees chose to exit the company rather than return to an office full-time.The company also identified parts of its South American business to cut and said Monday it divested Television Federal, the operator of TV stations in Buenos Aires and other markets in Argentina. It's also in the process of exiting Chilevision in Chile, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.These divestitures, which were deemed \"non-core\" to the company's future growth, according to the letter, would result in the 1,600 workforce reductions.Streaming, content in focusParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile Paramount Skydance's restructuring efforts, layoffs and cost savings have been a top priority for the company, Ellison has also wasted no time in making acquisitions to build up its content slate.Most notably, the company has reportedly been looking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would see it gain the Warner Bros. film studio, the HBO Max streaming service, and a portfolio of cable TV networks including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. Discovery recently put itself up for sale, and has rebuffed three offers from Ellison in recent weeks, CNBC reported.Ellison wouldn't comment on his aspirations for WBD on Monday, but said the company was in build mode, which may or may not include mergers and acquisitions.\"I think it's important to know there's no must-haves for us,\" he said. \"We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go.\"On the sports front, Paramount Skydance has added TKO Group's UFC to its slate in a 7-year, $7.7 billion deal. Paramount+ also became the exclusive long-term home for Zuffa Boxing, a new professional boxing promotion formed by TKO and the Saudi-backed Sela, in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.The company also inked a deal with Activision to develop content off of its Call of Duty video game franchise; signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the creators of \"South Park;\" and brought on Matt and Ross Duffer, the creative team behind Netflix's hit \"Stranger Things,\" beginning in mid-2026.The additions to its content slate are geared at boosting Paramount+ streaming subscribers. Paramount Skydance President Jeff Shell said during a call with investors that the service had experienced notable customer losses over the summer, but they returned in the fall at the start of the NFL season.On Monday, the company said Paramount+ had more than 79 million global subscribers.",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSony Group on Tuesday posted a stronger-than-expected rise in second-quarter operating profit and announced a share buyback of up to 100 billion Japanese yen ($648 million).Here are Sony's second-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: Revenue: 3.108 trillion Japanese yen ($20.14 billion) vs. 2.985 trillion yen expectedOperating profit: 429 billion yen vs. 398.44 billion yen expectedOperating profit climbed 10% from a year earlier, while revenues were up 5%. Sony shares jumped more than 6% after the earnings release.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Japanese technology giant raised its full-year outlook, expecting operating profit to climb by 100 billion yen, or 8% from its previous forecast, led by its imaging and sensing solutions and music segments. The company also lifted its annual revenue projection by 300 billion yen, or 3%, while trimming its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs to 50 billion yen from 70 billion yen.While Sony has been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's global tariff regime launched in April, Tokyo reached a trade deal with Washington in July that lowered duties on Japanese exports to 15% from the 25% initially proposed. The reduced tariffs took effect Aug. 7.Music and imaging boostProfit from Sony's music business increased 27.65% year over year to 115.4 billion yen, while operating profit from its imaging business jumped nearly 50% to 138.3 billion yen, making it the company's most profitable segment in the quarter.Sony's imaging and sensing solutions segment develops and manufactures advanced semiconductor products for a wide range of applications, from smartphones to automotive and industrial systems.The company also reported strong sales in its game and network services division, which houses its popular PlayStation home console brand. The segment represents Sony's top revenue driver, but posted a decrease in profits in the September quarter, falling 13.26% to 120.4 billion yen.Game and network services have performed well in recent quarters thanks to a shift to digital game purchases and the PlayStation Plus subscription service. Growth in hardware shipments has been comparably muted.KPop Demon HuntersDespite Sony's strong earnings showing, profit from its picture business shrank nearly 25% year over year. That was despite Sony Pictures Animation being behind this year's smash hit production, KPop Demon Hunters, which premiered on June 20. The film, which was produced by Sony, has reportedly become the most popular Netflix film ever, and continues to break streaming records, even for its original soundtrack. Despite the success, Sony has missed much of this upside due to selling the film's exclusive rights to Netflix.While the exact details of the deal are unknown, it was reported that Sony made an initial $25 million profit from producing the film for Netflix.Netflix saw K-pop Demon Hunters drive significant viewership and even contributed to its 17% revenue jump in its September quarter.However, in a bright spot for Sony, a sequel to the movie has already been confirmed, with Netflix reportedly providing the Japanese company a $15 million cash bonus for the first film's performance. ",

    "body": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesDemocratic senators on Monday blamed the White House push to fast track artificial intelligence data centers and its attacks on renewable energy for rising electricity prices in certain parts of the U.S.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others demanded that the White House and Commerce Department detail what actions they have taken to shield consumers from the impact of massive data centers in a letter sent Monday.Voters are increasingly feeling the pinch of rising electricity prices. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger campaigned on the issue in the New Jersey and Virgina governors' races, which they won in landslides last week.The senators took aim at the White House's relationship with companies like Meta, Alphabet, Oracle, and OpenAI, and the support the administration has shown for the companies' data center plans.The Trump administration \"has already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand,\" the senators wrote. They accused the White House of making the problem worse by opposing the expansion of solar and wind power.The White House blamed the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices in a statement.President Donald Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.The tech sector's AI plans have ballooned in size. OpenAI and Nvidia, for example, struck a deal in September to build 10 gigawatts of data centers to train and run AI applications. This is equivalent to New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.The scale of these plans have raised questions about whether enough power is available to meet the demand and who will pay for the new generation that is needed. Renewable energy, particularly solar and energy storage, is the power source that can be deployed the quickest right now to meet demand.Retail electricity prices in the U.S. increased about 6% on average through August 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prices, however, can vary widely by region.Download the full letter here. ",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Senate on Monday night passed a bill to fund the federal government through January and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.The bill, which passed 60-40 with support from a handful of Democratic senators and nearly all Republicans, will be sent to the House of Representatives.If it passes the House, the legislation will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.Trump earlier Monday said he supports the funding deal, which was negotiated between Republicans and a gang of moderate Senate Democrats nearly six weeks after the shutdown began on Oct. 1.House Speaker Mike Johnson told his Republican conference earlier Monday that he wanted GOP House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., for a vote on the bill.US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said Monday on CNN.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesUntil Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.Wright said he expects electricity demand from AI to attract billions of dollars in equity capital to build new nuclear capacity from \"very creditworthy providers.\" The Energy Department could match those private dollars by as much as four to one with low cost debt financing from the loan office, he said.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said.Westinghouse dealThe Trump administration struck a deal last month with the owners of Westinghouse to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the U.S. Westinghouse is owned by uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management.Westinghouse has designed a modern reactor called the AP1000 that can power more than 750,000 homes. CEO Dan Sumner said in July that Westinghouse would meet Trump's call to build large new plants with the AP1000 design.Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said last week that the U.S. government has a number of options available to facilitate the financing of Westinghouse reactors, including the Energy Department's loan office.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" Isaac told investors on Cameco's third-quarter earnings call.Under the terms of the October deal, Westinghouse could spin out as a separate, publicly-traded company with the U.S. government as a shareholder.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to build the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.Two AP1000 reactors entered service at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024, years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The South Carolina project was cancelled.",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom.In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that \"hyperscalers\" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic.\"Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings - one of the more common frauds of the modern era,\" Burry wrote. \"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

    "body": "A \"We're Hiring\" sign at the Appalachian State University internship and job fair in Boone, North Carolina, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJudging by current data, you'd think there's literally a job out there for anyone who wants one. Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story.The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers.But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled.Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with \"ghost jobs\" that never seem to get filled.\"The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,\" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on \"the ghost job economy.\" \"The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy.\"Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even.To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers.The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone.Potential inventoryMoreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future.Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer \"ghost jobs\" out there.One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards.Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday.However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C.Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the \"quits rate\" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the \"Great Resignation.\"A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures.There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision.\"For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,\" Escalera said. \"Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode.\"",

    "body": "Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks at a press conference with other Senate Democrats who voted to restore government funding, in Washington, DC on November 9, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUpdate: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.Senate Democrats are poised to help Republicans pass a bill that could lead to the end of the government shutdown. But the deal they're agreeing to doesn't directly address what was once Democrats' key demand: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to expire by year's end.The Senate took a major step toward ending the shutdown on Sunday night, when eight Democrats in the narrowly divided chamber voted for a procedural motion that paves the way for approval of a negotiated funding bill.Those eight Democrats, who broke with party leadership, were just enough for the measure to hit the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. That rule has prevented Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, from reopening the government on their own.The procedural vote's passage broke a nearly six-week logjam in which most Senate Democrats repeatedly shot down a Republican-backed bill that would temporarily resume government funding at current levels.What Democrats wantedDemocrats had demanded that any funding bill must include significant additional spending on health care protections and other key measures.Most notably, they fought for a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits under the ACA, which were introduced during the Biden administration and are set to expire by year's end. If those subsidies lapse, millions of Americans could either lose their health insurance or see their premiums rise significantly.Democrats also sought to reverse some recent cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. And they aimed to address the Trump administration's freezing of congressionally approved federal funds, which Democrats say is illegal.Update: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.What's in the funding dealThe text of the funding deal that helped spur Sunday's breakthrough leaves many of those priorities unaddressed. The 31-page bill makes no mention of the expiring Obamacare tax credits.U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looks on outside the Senate Chamber after the vote on the 40th day of the partial government shutdown, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 9, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersInstead, the agreement includes a guarantee from Republican leadership that the Senate will vote on a health care bill drafted by Democrats before the second week of December.\"That is a big step, because otherwise there's no way for the minority to get a bill onto the floor of the U.S. Senate,\" Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Sunday night after helping to broker the deal.Even if a bill to extend the tax credits passes the Senate, it would have to be taken up and passed through the GOP-led House, and then signed by President Donald Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not promised to bring such a bill to a vote in his chamber.The deal currently moving through the Senate also reportedly does not challenge Trump's ability to make rescissions of congressionally appropriated funds.But it does include a \"minibus\" that funds three of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and it would resume funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 30.That full-year funding would cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, sources familiar with the deal told NBC News. The Trump administration has said that full SNAP benefits cannot be paid during the shutdown, prompting ongoing lawsuits from Democratic state leaders.The deal would also reverse the Trump administration's shutdown-related \"reductions in force\" or layoffs of federal workers, and ensure backpay for the paychecks they missed during the shutdown.Deal divides DemocratsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" he said Sunday.U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a press conference to discuss how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting healthcare, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDistrustful Democrats had previously rejected Republicans' insistence that any negotiations on the Obamacare subsidies could only come once the government was reopened.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also panned the Senate deal, and vowed to fight it if it comes to his chamber.But King, who negotiated the Sunday compromise along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, maintained that it was futile to keep the painful shutdown going in hopes of getting Republicans to bend on health care.\"The question was, 'Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?' Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen,\" he told the press Sunday night.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe major shift came just days after Democratic candidates trounced Republicans up and down the ballot in the first elections since Trump returned to the White House.Additionally, numerous polls have show more Americans pinning their blame for the shutdown on Trump and Republicans, rather than Democrats. Surveys have also shown most Americans supported Democrats' initial main demand of extending the health care subsidies.But the stalemate dragged on, taking an increasingly severe toll on major industries and key federal services as many government workers remain furloughed or required to work without pay.Thinned-out staffing among air traffic controllers has caused mounting flight delays and cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country.The political fallout from the Senate Democrats' shutdown shift remains to be seen. Critics were quick to accuse the Democratic defectors of folding despite holding an arguably strong position on the shutdown. But defenders of the move say it could benefit Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections.\"With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table — or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way,\" Shaheen said in a statement.\"If they don't fix this, here's my prediction. They're going to look at last Tuesday's election as a good night compared to what they're going to see next year,\" Sen.

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, speaks during the 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting on Nov. 6, 2025.Courtesy: TeslaTesla shareholders voted last week to give CEO Elon Musk a record pay package, one that could net him about $1 trillion in company stock over the next decade. But Musk received less support than he did for an earlier pay plan in 2018.Setting aside holdings owned by board members and executives, about 66.9% of shares tabulated in the vote were in favor of the package, according to a filing on Friday. When shareholders voted on the 2018 plan, that number was 73%, according to an analysis by Andrew Droste, head of corporate governance at investment firm Columbia Threadneedle.In announcing the preliminary results on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders meeting, Tesla said the plan received 75% support among voting shares. The company count included insiders like Musk, who held around a 15% stake in Tesla going into the proxy and was allowed to vote his shares.The decline from the prior vote follows a tumultuous stretch for Musk and Tesla. Sales slumped in the first half of the year, in part because of Musk's inflammatory political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, slashing the size of the federal government. Tesla's brand value has also deteriorated.Still, Droste said in an email that even at just under 70%, the vote represents \"broad support for Elon among Tesla's shareholder base.\" Most investors recognize that Tesla and Elon Musk are \"inextricably linked,\" he wrote, and were \"unwilling to risk his potential departure by allowing this vote to fail.\"Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September. Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended that investors vote against it.The pay package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion, about $500 billion more than the current valuation. Awards tied to market cap gains are paired with operational achievements.Musk could still collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals laid out for him by the board in the new pay plan. There are also a list of \"covered events\" in the award terms that would allow him to earn his shares without meeting required operational milestones.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Correction: A prior version of this story had an incorrect figure for the vote in support of the pay package.WATCH: Key milestones behind Musk's pay packagewatch now",

    "body": "Hero Minnie will appear on Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyThe Disney fleet is expanding yet again.Later this month, the Disney Destiny cruise ship will make its maiden voyage from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, officially becoming the seventh ship in the company's lineup.The Destiny, which is 221 feet tall and 1,119 feet long, can carry 4,000 passengers and 1,555 crew members. For its inaugural season, the ship will offer four- and five-night cruises to the Bahamas and Western Caribbean, including visits to one or both of the company's island destinations, Disney Castaway Cay and Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point.Like Disney's other cruise ships, the new vessel features themed dining, curated lounges and premium on-board live entertainment. Disney's portfolio of intellectual property has been the bedrock of its theme parks since the very first location opened its doors, and that's translated to its cruise line as well.The Destiny features a heroes and villains theme. Black Panther is the feature character within the Destiny's Grand Hall, a prominent gathering space aboard the vessel, but guests will also be able to interact with iconic Disney villains and anti-heroes like Cruella de Vil, Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Captain Jack Sparrow and Loki.The Grand Hall of the Disney Destiny features an homage to Marvel's \"Black Panther,\" including a statue of the hero.DisneyThe Destiny sets sail at a time of rapid growth at the Walt Disney Company's experiences division, which includes its theme parks, resorts and cruise line. The company, which hadn't launched a new ship in a decade prior to the Disney Wish's debut in mid-2022, added the Disney Treasure last year and is set to have 13 vessels sailing by 2031.\"We're undergoing the largest expansion in our history,\" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney experiences, told CNBC. \"The Destiny, I think, is just going to be another example of how we continue again to push the envelope on what a cruise experience can be.\"In fiscal 2024, the experiences division posted record revenue and profit, with revenue up 5% for the full year to $34.15 billion and operating income up 4% to $9.27 billion. As of the fiscal third-quarter of 2025, Disney anticipated the experiences segment would see 8% growth in operating income for the current fiscal year. The company reports earnings Thursday.The experiences segment was the second-highest revenue driver for Disney last year behind its entertainment division, which tallied $41.19 billion in fiscal 2024. However, the entertainment segment's operating profits were smaller, at just $3.92 billion.Disney has become a leader in the family cruising space, despite its relatively small number of ships. Its fleet size of just seven ships is dwarfed by the largest cruise lines: Carnival, with more than 100 vessels; Royal Caribbean, with nearly 70; and Norwegian Cruise Line, with more than 30.Disney is considered slightly more expensive than Carnival and Royal Caribbean for base pricing, but if guests choose to upgrade to larger cabins or add food packages or experiences to their itineraries on the major cruise lines, the prices can be similar.Each stateroom aboard the Disney Destiny will showcase custom artwork depicting the epic journeys of famous Disney legends.DisneyDisney's Destiny offers four-night cruises starting at around $2,300 for two adult guests and about $4,000 for a family of four. Five-night cruises start at $2,900 for two adults and $4,700 for a family of four. These prices can increase if travelers select premium rooms or book cruises tied to Halloween or Christmas or for select seven-night cruises aboard the Destiny.Immersive, character-fueled diningLike other cruise ships in the space, the Disney Destiny features upscale restaurants, pools, spas and gaming rooms for kids, but the company injects storytelling into the mix.Additionally, Disney accommodates diners using \"rotational dining\" on its cruise ships. Passengers don't eat in one large mess hall — they are prescheduled to dine at different themed restaurants. Disney rotates the restaurant staff, too, to follow each group of passengers to their scheduled restaurant. As a result, guests have the same servers, busboys and restaurant managers throughout their trip, and the waitstaff gets to know the guests — and their preferences.Among the themed dining halls aboard Destiny is Pride Lands, a feast of the Lion King, which invites guests to dine on a menu with authentic African flavors while live musicians take the stage to present a retelling of Simba's story from cub to king.Pride Lands: Feast of The Lion King is a \"Lion King\"-themed dining experience featuring live musical performances and an African-inspired menu.DisneyAt Worlds of Marvel, families will listen to a mix of hit songs and test their superhero knowledge while they eat. Rocket and Groot from \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" will be featured in an onscreen story that will unfold during the meal. The menu features nods to in-universe locations like Wakanda and the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia as well as New York, the home base of the Avengers.A 1923 dining hall, named for the founding year of the Walt Disney Company, celebrates the legacy of Disney's animation. This setting features more than 1,000 drawings, props and other tools of the animation trade, including artwork from \"Hercules,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Big Hero 6\" and \"Wreck-It Ralph.\" The menu at 1923 is inspired by the fusion of cultural flavors found throughout California, including Asian, European and South American influences.Guests looking for quick meals and snacks will have a number of other dining options including Cafe Megara and Cafe Merida as well as Edna Á La Mode Sweets, a confectionary with gelato, ice cream, cookies, candies and other specialty treats based on super-suit designer Edna Mode from \"The Incredibles.\"Kid-friendly experiencesFor many, Disney cruises are a family affair. So, the company has dedicated spaces for every age group. It's a Small World nursery offers babysitting services for children ages 6 months to 3 years, while older children can head over to Disney's Oceaneer Club, which features several immersive spaces themed to Marvel's superheroes, Disney's princesses, Star Wars and Mickey and Minnie Mouse.There's a two-story venue called Saga that plays host to interactive shows and events like \"Match Your Mate\" and \"Family Time Game Show,\" as well as Edge, a space for tweens to make friends and play games, and Vibe for those aged between 14 and 17 to watch movies, listen to music and hang out.The Walt Disney Theatre will be the home to a Broadway-style production of \"Hercules,\" a show that features innovative puppetry and state-of-the-art effects.Guests aboard the Disney Destiny will be able to see a Broadway-style production of \"Hercules\" featuring innovative puppetry and special effects.DisneyEach cruise will also include live performances of \"Frozen, a Musical Spectacular\" and \"Disney Seas the Adventure.\" There will also be Pirates Rockin' Parlay Party, a nighttime spectacular featuring a live rock band and fireworks, an \"Incredibles\" themed sports area and all-you-can-watch complimentary movie screenings at Wonderland and Never Land Cinemas.Similar to the Wish and the Treasure, the Destiny also has a Toy Story-themed area that includes a splash pool, wading pool and family waterslide. There's also an adapted version of the AquaMouse water coaster called \"Sing a Silly Song.\"Adult-friendly fareDisney has also designed locations that are just for adults.Quiet Cove is sequestered away from the bustling family activities and features an infinity pool, a poolside bar and a cafe. Senses Spa offers spa and beauty treatments, while Senses Fitness is an exercise and wellness facility.The Disney Destiny also features De Vil's piano lounge, a lavish locale for trendy cocktails, and the Sanctum, a lounge that takes inspiration from Doctor Strange from the Marvel universe.The Sanctum is a lounge for the Disney Destiny's adult guests. It is inspired by Marvel's Doctor Strange.Disney\"We're continuing to take intellectual property or franchises, not just from the big screen, but from our theme parks as well,\" D'Amaro said. \"We did that with 'Haunted Mansion' on our last ship, and 'Haunted Mansion' will be back on the Destiny this time, as well. But, you'll also see a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' lounge, for example, which is just gorgeous, and I think our guests are going to respond exceptionally well to it.\"This is the second time that Disney has brought its theme park IP to its cruise line. The Haunted Mansion Parlor debuted on the Disney Treasure last year, and a similar lounge area, featuring ghostly design elements and spooky cocktails, will be on board the Destiny.There's also Cask & Cannon, which is the eclectic but cozy pub inspired by \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" attraction. This is the first time \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" has been brought aboard a Disney ship in this capacity. The destination will feature themed drinks and decor.Loose Cannons, a drink available on the Disney Destiny at the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"-inspired pub Cask & Cannon.DisneyMore on the horizonThe Disney Destiny's launch will be quickly followed up by the maiden voyage of the Disney Adventure, which will service Singapore starting in March 2026. Additional ships will launch between 2027 and 2031, bringing the Disney cruise fleet to 13 vessels.\"From a business perspective, the Disney cruise line is very important, not only to the Disney experiences segment, but to the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"This is a huge brand ambassador for us. So, the ability to take all of the stories that we have to tell and bring them around the world with an asset that moves is very, very powerful for us.\"D'Amaro noted that the segment has seen double-digit returns on its cruise ships and continues to generate high occupancy and strong future bookings.The exterior of Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyBut, Disney's cruise line isn't the only piece of the company's experiences business that is expanding. There are construction plans across the globe for Disney's theme parks and resorts.\"We are in the middle of turbocharging the Disney experiences segment of the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"So, it's a really special time for this part of the business. We have more projects underway right now than we have ever had in the history of the company.\"The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, is seeing its largest expansion ever at Magic Kingdom with the addition of a villains-themed land and a \"Cars\" area being added in Frontierland. A \"Monsters Inc.\" land is coming to Hollywood Studios and the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster is being rethemed to feature \"The Muppets.\" At Animal Kingdom, the company is adding an \"Encanto\" and an \"Indiana Jones\" attraction.On the West Coast at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, Avengers Campus at the California Adventure Park will be expanded to include two more rides. The company is also adding an \"Avatar\" area and its first ever \"Coco\" attraction.Internationally, the company is set to break ground on its seventh theme park resort in Abu Dhabi. Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland and Tokyo Disney are all getting new attractions based on popular IP.\"We have so many more stories to tell, and it's happening all over the world,\" D'Amaro said. \"Every single one of our destinations is undergoing a significant transformation, adding new capacity, adding new stories, adding new ports.\"",

    "body": "Starbucks workers and supporters practice picket outside a Starbucks location in New York, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 100 lawmakers urged Starbucks to resume bargaining talks with Workers United, the union representing the coffee giant's baristas, in letters sent to CEO Brian Niccol on Monday.The two letters, from the Congressional Labor Caucus and a group of senators led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., come as the union threatens a strike in 25 cities starting Thursday. That coincides with Starbucks' Red Cup Day, one of its biggest sales days of the holiday season.\"It is clear that Starbucks has the money to reach a fair agreement with its workers,\" the Senate letter, signed by 26 lawmakers, reads. \"Starbucks must reverse course from its current posture, resolve its existing labor disputes, and bargain a fair contract in good faith with these employees.\"A second Congressional Labor Caucus letter is signed by 82 lawmakers.The lawmakers argued the coffee giant has the resources to increase workers' pay and benefits, citing Niccol's $95 million compensation since his hiring. The company said $90 million of the compensation package was in the form of stock awards to cover equity Niccol left behind at Chipotle when moving to Starbucks to take the CEO role.Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the US Capitol Building on Nov. 8, 2025 in Washington, DC. Aaron Schwartz | Getty ImagesLast week, Workers United said its strike authorization vote won a 92% approval from its members. If the union decides to strike, it would be open-ended. Workers United is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against the company.The two parties are not in active contract talks after discussions fell apart late last year. Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April.Both sides have pointed blame for failure to reach a bargaining agreement at the other party and say they're ready to negotiate.Workers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 650 stores. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers at 550 cafes.Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen said in a statement last week, \"We want Starbucks to succeed, but turning the company around and bringing customers back begins with listening to and supporting the baristas who are responsible for the Starbucks experience. If Starbucks keeps stonewalling, they should expect to see their business grind to a halt. The ball is in Starbucks' court.\"In response to the strike vote results last week, Starbucks said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.\"As everybody knows, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. Workers United, which represents only 4% of our partners, chose to walk away from the bargaining table. We've asked them to return—many times. If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CNBC in a statement Monday.In a letter to workers addressing the strike authorization vote last week, Sara Kelly, chief partner officer at Starbucks, echoed the belief that an agreement could be reached swiftly.\"For months, we were at the bargaining table, working in good faith with Workers United and delegates from across the country to reach agreements that make sense for partners and for the long-term success of Starbucks,\" Kelly said. \"We reached more than 30 tentative agreements on full contract articles.\"\"Our commitment to bargaining hasn't changed,\" she added. \"Workers United walked away from the table but if they are ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.\"Reuters earlier reported on the letters from lawmakers. — CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed to this reportwatch now",

She was traveling often for work and the home she almost bought would have required her to spend roughly three hours a day commuting in and out of the city. At 27, she put all her belongings into storage and spent the year traveling the world, something that would have been much more difficult had she owned a home at the time.</p><p>\"Every time I would even try to consider being a homeowner going through the process, I didn't have the bandwidth,\" she says. \"[It] just wasn't the right time. I thought, 'OK, there's a bunch of stuff that I have to do for the business.'\"</p><p>But that changed recently as the 31-year-old bought her first home in the summer of 2025.</p></div><h2><a></a>'Sick of having somebody else decide where I was going to live'</h2><div><p>From a financial perspective, Dunlap had been able to buy a home for some time. She <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/28/im-24-and-on-track-to-save-100000-next-year-here-are-my-money-saving-tips.html\">had $100,000 saved</a> by the time she turned 25 and had a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/tori-dunlap-no-1-mistake-first-time-investors-make.html\">multimillion dollar net worth</a> by age 27, she says. But continuing to rent allowed her to keep building her business and enjoying traveling for long stretches without worrying about having to make a mortgage payment on top of a short-term rental stay, she says.</p><p>Earlier this year, though, the owner of her most recent rental listed the property for sale — a situation Dunlap had dealt with during a previous lease. Faced with the decision of finding another rental or taking the plunge into ownership, her broader life circumstances led her to the latter.</p><p>\"I was frankly sick of having somebody else decide where I was going to live every single year, and I didn't like that lack of stability,\" she said on a <a href=\"https://herfirst100k.com/financial-feminist-show-notes/home-buying-lessons/\" target=\"_blank\">recent episode</a> of her podcast. She had been in a relationship for nearly three years and her business was going well. That security shifted her thinking: \"I want to be able to make a decision of when I leave, when I stay, and what I want my life to look like,\" she said.</p><p>\"And that's when I went, 'OK, I think it's time. I think it's time to buy a house.'\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'I'm now a multimillionaire with debt'</h2><div><p>The home Dunlap chose was less a financial decision than an emotional one. She wasn't trying to find the property that would provide the best return on investment or be the most affordable option, but rather the one that felt like home, an example of her broader philosophy on how people should view financial decisions and wealth-building.</p><p>\"I want personal finance and money to be a tool,\" she says. \"You don't want it to be the thing that makes or breaks a decision for you … don't buy the house if you can't see yourself there, if it doesn't feel like someplace that actually feels like home. It doesn't matter how good of an investment it is.\"</p><p>Still, she used her financial expertise to be strategic about how she bought her home.</p><p>Dunlap planned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/06/self-made-millionaire-has-owned-4-homes-but-chooses-to-rent.html\">buy a home in cash</a>, but when she found the house she wanted, it was a bit above the price she wanted to pay, she says. However, she \"was in the financial position to not just go over my budget, but to actually think differently about how I was going to afford this house at all,\" she said on the podcast.</p><p>In the end, she made a \"game-time decision\" to get a mortgage on her house and put about 60% down, she says. The house needed plumbing repairs for which she was initially quoted around $50,000. Though she found a contractor to do the work for considerably less, the instance provided a good example of why it's smart for new homeowners especially to keep some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/10/cost-of-hidden-homeownership-expenses-in-every-us-state.html\">cash reserves</a>.</p><p>\"For the first time in five years, I'm now a multimillionaire with debt,\" she says. \"I think that surprises a lot of people, that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/paying-off-your-mortgage-early-biggest-downside-says-self-made-millionaire.html\">debt can be used as leverage</a> and as an asset, because I don't want to tie up the cash I don't have to tie up ... I wanted to think about protecting my cash and using debt in the smart way.\"</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

WFA days are distinct from that policy, giving staffers the flexibility to work remotely, but not at home.</p><p>\"WFA weeks cannot be used to work from home or nearby,\" the document says.</p><p>Google didn't immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p>Tech companies are increasingly forcing employees to spend more time in the office, with the peak of Covid now about five years in the past. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span> said last month that employees will be expected to work in an office three days a week starting next year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/microsoft-says-employees-will-be-expected-in-office-three-days-a-week.html\">switching</a> from a policy that allowed most of them to work from home <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/microsoft-implements-new-hybrid-remote-work-policy.html\">50% of the time</a> or more with manager approval. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a> went further, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/amazon-jassy-tells-employees-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week.html\">instructing</a> corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office.</p><p>Google began offering some U.S. full-time employees <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/27/google-makes-cuts-to-hr-and-cloud-units.html\">voluntary buyouts</a> at the beginning of 2025, and has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/google-teams-are-including-remote-workers-in-their-cuts.html\">notified</a> remote workers from several units their jobs would be considered for layoffs if they didn't return to offices to work a hybrid schedule.</p><p>According to the latest changes, employees can't work from a Google office in a separate state or country during their WFA time due to \"legal and financial implications of cross border work.\" If in a different location, employees may be required to work during the business hours that align with that time zone, the rules state.</p><p>The WFA update doesn't apply to all Google staffers and may exclude data center workers, and those who are required to be in physical offices. Violations of the policy will result in disciplinary action or termination, the document says.</p><p>The issue came up at a recent all-hands meeting.</p><p>A top-rated question that was submitted on Google's internal system described the update as \"confusing.\"</p><p>\"Why does even one day of WFA count as a whole week, and can we reconsider the restriction on using WFA weeks to work from home?\" the question said.</p><p>John Casey, Google's vice president of performance and rewards, said at the meeting that WFA \"was meant to meet Googlers where they were during the pandemic,\" according to audio obtained by CNBC.</p><p>\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid work week,\" Casey said.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/18/google-adds-gemini-to-chrome-for-all-users-in-push-to-bolster-ai-search.html\">Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all users in push to bolster AI search</a></p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108200857-1758216170719-Screenshot_2025-09-18_at_12237_PM.png?v=1758216195&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all users in push to bolster AI search\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

The reduction took the federal funds rate down to a target range of 4%-4.25%.</p><p>Ultimately, a slight 10-9 majority favored the equivalent of quarter-point cuts at each of the two remaining meetings this year. Projection materials indicated the likelihood of one more cut in both 2026 and 2027 before the funds rate settles in a long-term range around 3%.</p><p>However, the meeting featured a range of viewpoints. The Sept.16-17 session was the first for newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran, who took office just hours before the start.</p><p>Miran singled himself out as a lone voter who favored a much more aggressive easing path. Though the minutes do not identify individual participants, the post-meeting statement noted that Miran was the dissenting vote, preferring instead a half-point cut.</p><p>Moreover, in subsequent public appearances, Miran noted that he was a lone \"dot\" that indicated a much more aggressive path of easing than the rest of the committee.</p></div><h2><a></a>Concerns over the labor market</h2><div><p>The meeting appeared to see views across the spectrum, with some preferring a more cautious approach to cuts.</p><p>\"Some participants noted that, by several measures, financial conditions suggested that monetary policy may not be particularly restrictive, which they judged as warranting a cautious approach in the consideration of future policy changes,\" the minutes said.</p><p>Officials grew concerned with the state of the labor market, which they saw as weakening as upside threats to inflation continued though they still expected it to ease back to the Fed's 2% target.</p><p>\"Participants generally noted that their judgments about this meeting's appropriate policy<br />action reflected a shift in the balance of risks,\" the minutes said. \"In particular, most participants observed that it was appropriate to move the target range for the federal funds rate toward a more neutral setting because they judged that downside risks to employment had increased over the intermeeting period and that upside risks to inflation had either diminished or not increased.\"</p><p>Tariffs were a significant part of the discussion, with a general feeling that President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s levies would not be a major source of lasting inflation after pushing prices higher this year.</p><p>The committee's sentiment on rates matched a survey the Fed sends to primary dealers in financial markets, the summary said.</p><p>\"Almost all respondents to the Desk survey expected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and around half expected an additional cut at the October meeting,\" the minutes stated. \"The vast majority of survey respondents expected at least two 25 basis point cuts by year-end, with around half expecting three cuts over that time.\"</p><p>One basis point equals 0.01%, so a 25 basis point move is the equivalent of a quarter percentage point.</p><p>Along with the unusual level of diverse opinions, policymakers now face fallout from the government shutdown. Data providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments have shuttered operations while the impasse continues and are not releasing or collecting data.</p><p>Should the shutdown not end by the FOMC's Oct. 28-29 meeting, policymakers essentially will be flying blind on key economic metrics for inflation, unemployment and consumer spending. Market pricing implies a near certainty that the Fed will cut both at the upcoming meeting and one in December, but that decision could be influenced by the lack of data.</p><p><em>Correction: An earlier version misattributed the opinion of a market survey to that of Fed officials. A survey of market participants indicated that \"around half\" expect three total cuts this year.</em></p></div></div>",

In an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6382416061112\" target=\"_blank\">interview to Fox News</a>, Trump said he expected the hostages to be released \"probably\" on Monday, stateside.</p><p>Hamas confirmed the details in a separate statement. \"We highly appreciate the efforts of our mediating brothers in Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey.

Ten gigawatts is equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, or New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.</p><p>When asked who is winning the AI race, Huang said the U.S. is \"not far ahead\" of China right now.

Data centers should be outfitted with natural gas and then potentially nuclear power at some point in the future, the CEO said.</p><p>\"We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,\" Huang said. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" he said.</p></div></div>",

London listed shares of HSBC declined over 6%.</p><p>\"Our offer is an exciting opportunity to grow both Hang Seng and HSBC,\" said HSBC Group Chief Executive Georges Elhedery. \"We will preserve Hang Seng's brand, heritage and customer proposition while investing to unlock new strengths in products, services and technology.\"</p><p>He added that the deal underscores HSBC's confidence in Hong Kong's role as a leading global financial center and as a \"super-connector\" between international markets and mainland China.</p><p>The offer allows for adjustments reflecting any dividends declared after the announcement date, except Hang Seng's third interim dividend for 2025.</p><p>\"One of HSBC's strategic priorities is to grow in Hong Kong,\" the bank said in its filing statement, adding that it believes it is \"best positioned\" to do so by strengthening the Hong Kong banking presence of both HSBC Asia Pacific and Hang Seng Bank.</p><p>Hang Seng Bank is a core regional unit for London-based HSBC, with a substantial presence in the Hong Kong banking industry.</p><p>\"Parent-subsidiary double listings are inherently problematic in terms of governance and in this sense it's a positive and long-overdue move,\" said Michael Makdad, senior analyst at Morningstar.</p><p>Hang Seng Bank has seen an uptick in bad loans in recent years, tied to its concentration in the Hong Kong and mainland China's embattled real estate sectors.</p><p><a href=\"https://cms.hangseng.com/cms/cse/announcement/E00011interimresults2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">In its 2025 </a>first-half results, the bank stated that non-performing loans reached 6.69% of total loans and advances to customers, “primarily due to ongoing credit pressure in the property sector.” That's up from 6.12% as of Dec. 31, 2024, and 5.32% as of June 30, 2024.</p></div></div>",

Virginia.</p><p>Comey's lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, and prosecutors said they expect that trial to last only two to three days.</p><p>Fitzgerald told Nachmanoff that he will soon file legal papers requesting that the case be tossed on the grounds of vindictive and selective prosecution, according to NBC News.</p><p>Comey is accused of making a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/james-comey-indicted-fbi-trump.html\">false </a>statement and obstruction of a congressional proceeding during testimony to a Senate committee in 2020.</p><p>Comey, who was fired as FBI director by Trump in 2017, is accused of lying during testimony before the <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> on Sept. 30, 2020.</p><p>That day, Comey denied authorizing someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about a probe of Hillary Clinton and her emails when she was the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.</p><p>Two federal prosecutors from North Carolina have been assigned to handle Comey's case, which is seen as a sign that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, had difficulty getting prosecutors in her own office to work on the case.</p><p>Halligan was put in that job by Trump shortly after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from Trump following Siebert's reported reluctance to seek a grand jury indictment of Comey.</p><p>On Wednesday, Fitzgerald told Nachmanoff that Halligan's appointment was \"unlawful,\" according to NBC.</p><p>Fitzgerald also said he will soon file motions in court addressing what he called \"abuse\" of the grand jury that Halligan personally asked to indict Comey, and \"outrageous government conduct.\"</p><p>Nachmanoff and Fitzgerald pushed back against a prosecutor's assertion that the case was complex and would involve a large amount of classified information and documents.</p><p>\"We view this as a simple case,\" Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Nachmanoff said, \"This does not appear to me to be an overly complicated case.\"</p><p>He warned the prosecutors that he would \"not slow this case down because the government does not promptly turn everything over,\" referring to the requirement that the prosecution turn over evidence related to the case to Comey's defense team before trial.</p><p>Squabbles over the pace and amount of information exchanged in that process, known as \"discovery,\" often bog down criminal cases.</p><p>\"The government is going to be under an enormous amount of pressure to figure out what actions need to be done here,\" Nachmanoff said.</p></div><div><h2>Read more CNBC politics coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\"

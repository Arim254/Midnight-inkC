    "body": "A new year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial habits and make small changes that can have a big impact. For over a decade, I've worked with clients navigating life transitions, like divorce and retirement, to help them forge their new financial paths. In my experience, there are six money personalities that represent the ways that people's money beliefs and attitudes play out in daily life. Here's my best money advice for each personality going into 2026: 1. The GiverThe Giver has a heart of gold and a generous spirit. Whether helping a friend in need, contributing to a worthy cause, or lending a hand to a stranger down on their luck, the Giver is always there. But this can lead to overspending, neglected personal financial needs, and even feelings of resentment.My best money advice for 2026For the Giver, the key is finding balance. With thoughtful planning and increased awareness of when to say no, you can continue to support others without jeopardizing your financial situation. When you find yourself in a pinch, remember that there are many ways to fill others' cups — as well as your own — that don't cost a dime. In fact, often your time and talents can make an even greater impact than your treasures.2. The TrailblazerTrailblazers don't follow the herd — they lead it. They exude confidence and embrace thoughtful risks. They are driven, focused, and relentless in their pursuit of success. But here's the twist: Their fierce independence can lead to burnout and a reluctance to ask for help.My best money advice for 2026While a Trailblazer may excel at creating wealth, managing it requires a much different skill set. It's important to learn how to delegate. By recognizing your limitations and leveraging the expertise of others, you can maximize the potential of your hard-earned money. This will ultimately reduce stress and enhance your overall financial success — allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.3. The SkepticMoney? Nah, that's for the fat cats and money-grubbers. The Skeptic's mistrust can stunt their financial progress. They often feel caught between believing they don't deserve wealth and panicking at the thought of pursuing it. The result? They continue to repeat behaviors that leave them feeling financially insecure.My best money advice for 2026Writing down all your positive qualities can help you see that your worth isn't tied to your bank account. Surround yourself with people who are financially successful — as well as kind and generous — to help reshape your views on money. Witnessing how wealth can be used for good might help dismantle the assumption that it inherently breeds greed.4. The High RollerHigh Rollers live for the moment! Fancy things light them up. Saving for the future? Not so much. Their emotions can lead to impulsive purchases, and they can easily lose track of spending — which may result in a pile of debt. This constant pursuit of pleasure can cause the High Roller to feel empty inside. My best money advice for 2026Exploring how you cope with emotions, like boredom or anxiety, can help reduce impulse purchases. Budgeting apps or spending trackers, along with thoughtful discussions about the relationship between self-worth and material things, can help build self-awareness around spending habits. Transitioning to a cash-only system can also be a powerful tool for you — limiting your ability to rely on credit cards when you're tempted to splurge.5. The Penny PincherThe Penny Pincher is a perpetual saver, regardless of how much they have in the bank. They are disciplined and resourceful when it comes to spending (which is a good thing!) and often feel guilty after making a purchase — even when it's a necessity. Typically, they are debt- and risk-averse and fear losing it all, which can cause them to miss out on opportunities to effectively grow their wealth or benefit from valuable experiences.My best money advice for 2026Learning the basics of investing can empower the Penny Pincher to take calculated risks. Setting specific spending goals — like taking a dream vacation or planning fun nights out with friends — can help you shift your focus from what you might lose to what your money can help you gain and experience. This approach can build confidence and create a more balanced perspective.6. The AvoiderThe Avoider would rather not think about money, let alone talk about it. They typically have no idea where they stand financially. And frankly, most don't know where to start. But the more they avoid their situation, the more anxious they become.My best money advice for 2026Even the smallest actions can spark change. Dedicating just 10 minutes each week to reviewing your account balances, exploring your spending, or asking for help can empower you to confront your financial situation with less stress. Additionally, seeking resources like online articles, podcasts, or financial literacy classes can help you take actionable steps to improve your financial well-being.Keep in mindThese aren't meant to be reductive labels but rather lenses that build awareness of your current habits. Remember:These aren't rigid categories. Your behavior with money can change over time as life experiences shape new financial habits.Growth is always possible. Recognizing your tendencies empowers you to make intentional shifts and cultivate healthier behaviors.Identifying with multiple types is typical. It's common to exhibit traits from more than one personality type.And of course, you may want to seek personalized financial advice that's tailored to your specific needs.Steph Wagner is a nationally recognized thought leader in women's wealth and financial empowerment who serves as the National Director of Women & Wealth at Northern Trust.

    "body": "Many U.S. workers are ringing in the new year with a raise as new minimum wage increases take effect in states and localities across the country on Thursday.More than 8.3 million workers are expected to benefit from minimum wage hikes in 19 states, which will collectively add an estimated $5 billion in earnings nationwide, according to a December report by the Economic Policy Institute.On top of changes to state minimum wages, many cities and municipalities with local wage standards increased their minimum wages Thursday as well. For example, Seattle's minimum wage rose to $21.30 an hour, and the minimum wage in Minneapolis is now $16.37 an hour.Minimum wage workers in Hawaii will see the largest jump in their hourly pay. The state's minimum wage rose by $2 per hour, from $14 to $16. Other states with minimum wage increases include Arizona, California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.The federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009.

    "body": "After 60 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett stepped down as the holding company's CEO at the end of 2025. Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Beginning January 1, 2026, an estimated 6.1 million more Americans will be eligible to open and contribute to Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, according to National Disability Institute.ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged investment accounts designed for Americans with disabilities. Created by Congress in 2014, ABLE accounts allow beneficiaries to save for qualified expenses like education, housing, health care and more without affecting their Medicaid or Social Security income eligibility. Previously, beneficiaries had to have a qualifying medical condition that began before their 26th birthday, but that cut-off rises to age 46 as of January 1 due to the ABLE Age Adjustment Act passed in 2022. The expanded age requirement brings the total number of Americans eligible to open ABLE accounts up to around 14 million, per NDI's estimates.ABLE accounts are \"a powerful wealth planning, financial and tax planning vehicle,\" Juliana Crist, head of ABLE programs at Vestwell, a financial technology company that manages 19 of the country's ABLE plans, tells CNBC Make It. Crist describes it as \"kind of a super-powered Roth\" individual retirement account.As with Roth IRAs, contributions to ABLE accounts are made with after-tax dollars. Beneficiaries can invest the money in a portfolio which grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are not subject to income taxes. But with ABLE accounts, beneficiaries can set aside more money per year and can use the funds whenever they want, rather than needing to wait until they hit a certain age. ABLE account withdrawals for qualified expenses are not taxed as income. However, withdrawals for non-qualifying expenses are subject to income tax and a 10% penalty.Account holders can have up to $100,000 saved in an ABLE account without losing access to Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits. Individuals with savings exceeding $2,000 in regular savings or other investment accounts risk losing those benefits.Here's how ABLE accounts work and who can open one.Eligibility requirements and contribution limitsABLE accounts are available to U.S. citizens in all 50 states who are either eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance or can self-certify that they have a qualifying medical condition. \"A lot more people can qualify for an ABLE account than realize it,\" Crist says. \"People hear that this is an account for people with disabilities, and that person might actually have a qualifying medical condition, but they don't think of it as a disability ... a lot of our eligible people just don't realize that this could be a tool they could even use.\"To self-certify, individuals must have a written diagnosis of a qualifying condition signed by a licensed physician that also confirms the onset of the condition was before the individual's 46th birthday. Qualifying conditions include blindness, as defined by the Social Security Administration, along with a variety of other physical and mental conditions such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Individuals do not have to provide proof of diagnosis when opening an ABLE account, but they need to certify that they have one, according to ABLE National Resource Center.Beneficiaries can contribute up to $20,000 a year into an ABLE account in 2026. Individuals who work but do not contribute to a workplace retirement plan can contribute an additional amount equal to the individual poverty threshold — $15,650 in 2026 — or up to their employment earnings, whichever is less. That limit rises to $19,550 for Alaska residents and $17,990 for Hawaii residents in 2026. Virtually anyone can contribute to a beneficiary's ABLE account including parents and other family members or employers. But total contributions may not exceed the annual limit.How to choose the best ABLE account for youNearly every state and Washington, D.C. sponsor ABLE accounts and most allow out-of-state participation, according to ABLE NRC. Four states — Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin — don't have their own plans. Depending on where you live and your personal financial situation, it may make sense to shop around between different states' plans — a search which could benefit from the help of a financial professional.If you're looking to open an ABLE account, Crist suggests starting your search with your home state's plan if one is available. That's because some states offer state income tax deductions for ABLE account contributions.Plus, \"sometimes it's easier and more familiar to be able to reach out to a person in your own backyard if you have questions or you need support,\" she adds.From there, you'll want to compare investment options and costs for different ABLE accounts. Generally, ABLE accounts have management fees that can run around $30 a year, Crist says. The plans also may charge a fee equal to 0.1% to 0.3% of assets in your account she says. Some plans offer more investment options than others, which could be a deciding factor.\"Some states have much larger investment menus, like 15 options to choose from, as opposed to some states only offer four investment options to choose from — simple versus complex, so that can appeal to different types of savers and investors,\" Crist says.If you want a debit card attached to your account, some plans offer that as well, but not all, she adds.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore's economy expanded 5.7% year on year for the fourth quarter, the highest since 2021, driven mainly by a sharp increase in manufacturing output during the three months through December.The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Singapore's manufacturing sector posted a 15% expansion, a massive jump compared to the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely driven by the biomedical manufacturing and electronics clusters, the ministry said.Manufacturing makes up about 20% of the city-state's GDP.Most other sectors contracted during the quarter, including construction and services.The advance estimate was higher than the revised 4.3% growth in the previous quarter, lifting full-year GDP growth to 4.8%, as announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his New Year's message. The 4.8% growth had surpassed the country's Ministry of Trade and Industry's upgraded forecast of \"around 4%\" in November. \"This is a better outcome than we expected, given the circumstances,\" Wong said, while warning that sustaining the current pace of growth would be challenging.Singapore's MTI had forecast a GDP growth figure of about 1%-3% for 2026. Selena Ling, Chief Economist & Head of Group Research & Strategy at OCBC, said that Singapore's GDP performance \"showcased economic resilience through broad-based and diversified strengths in manufacturing, services, and construction.\"Ling projected GDP growth of about 2% in 2026, assuming manufacturing growth eases to around 2.2% year on year due to a high base in 2025.Singapore had earlier cautioned that 2025 would be challenging, citing trade risks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration slapped trade tariffs on dozens of countries in his \"Liberation Day\" on April.Despite having a free trade agreement with the U.S. since 2004, Singapore was hit with the 10% baseline tariff. Wong said at the time that \"these are not actions one does to a friend.\"Singapore is highly dependent on trade, with its trade-to-GDP ratio exceeding 320% in 2024, according to data from the World Bank.The country also warned in April last year that zero growth was a possibility and eased monetary policy twice in 2025 to prepare for a slowdown.

    "body": "A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.Ying Tang | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Baidu plans to spin off its artificial intelligence chip subsidiary, Kunlunxin, and list it in Hong Kong, as more domestic chipmakers seek funds amid Beijing's push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.The company said in an announcement Friday that it had confidentially filed a listing application on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, though details of the offering, including size and structure, remain undecided.The move would still require regulatory approvals, including from China's securities watchdog. Baidu emphasized there is no guarantee the spin-off will proceed. The company  reportedly owns about 59% of Kunlunxin.Baidu, a major player in China's growing AI space, is both a buyer of specialized AI chips for data centers and cloud computing, as well as a designer of them through Kunlunxin.The firm said that the spin-off would align with its strategy to highlight Kunlunxin's standalone potential, attract sector-specific investors, and expand financing options. Kunlunxin would remain a Baidu subsidiary, it added.The move comes against a backdrop of intensifying U.S.-China tech tensions. Both Washington and Beijing have imposed various restrictions on Chinese AI companies' access to leading-edge AI chips from California-based Nvidia.Meanwhile, Beijing has increasingly encouraged domestic chip purchases and mobilized billions in public funds towards development. In recent months, several Chinese chipmakers have announced plans to list, including Moore Threads and Biren Technology.A Growing Business FocusFounded in 2012, Kunlunxin is central to Baidu's ambition to become a \"full stack\" AI company, spanning hardware, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.While Baidu still relies heavily on Nvidia's chips for AI computing power, Kunlunxin has enabled the company to increasingly use a mix of its self-developed chips in data centers running its Ernie AI models.Kunlunxin has also shifted to operate as a separate entity, expanding its sales to third-party customers outside Baidu.\"In the market, Kunlunxin is seen as one of the most practical and widely used AI chips in China,\" Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. He added that one of the chipmaker's main strengths is in software. \"Instead of forcing users to adopt a closed system, Kunlunxin works well with common AI frameworks and makes it easier to move workloads from [Nvidia].\" Reuters previously reported that Kunlunxin's revenue is projected to exceed 3.5 billion yuan ($500 million) last year, reaching break-even. External sales were expected to account for more than half of its revenue in 2025, the report added. In another sign of strength last year, Kunlunxin won orders worth over 1 billion yuan from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.China Mobile also participated in the entity's latest funding, which had raised over 2 billion yuan and valued the unit at about 21 billion yuan, according to Reuters.In its announcement, Baidu said its plans to spin off and list Kunlunxin would better tie management incentives with performance and elevate the unit's market presence.Late last year, JPMorgan analysts forecast that Kunlunxin's chip sales would increase sixfold to 8 billion Chinese yuan in 2026.However, while Kunlunxin may help reduce China's reliance on chips from Nvidia, it cannot fully replace them, Counterpoint's Wang said, citing Beijing's ongoing constraints in advanced chip manufacturing. \"[Kunlunxin's chips] work best for inference and other workloads that are easier to move, especially for government, telecom, and state-owned cloud users, where stable supply and lower cost matter more than top performance,\" he said. \"Because of this, Beijing is not relying on a single company. Instead, Kunlunxin works together with Huawei Ascend, Cambricon, Alibaba, and others to build a domestic AI computing ecosystem.\"",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs.

The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing. It's a revenge tour,\" said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who is also running for Colorado governor, in a post to X. \"It's unacceptable. I'll keep fighting to get rural Colorado the clean water they deserve.\"Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., also alleged Trump's veto was partisan. \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water,\" Hickenlooper said on X. \"Congress should swiftly overturn this veto.\"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, a staunch Trump ally, said on her X account that \"This isn't over.\"In a statement she gave to Colorado-based NBC-affiliate KUSA, Boebert said she \"hope[s] this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\"Boebert was one of the Republicans who joined Democrats in compelling the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump did not mention Peters in his rationale for vetoing the legislation. On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

A law that shielded student loan forgiveness from taxation at the federal level — part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — expired on Dec. 31, 2025. President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" did not extend or make permanent that provision.As a result, certain borrowers who've recently received education debt cancellation or expect to do so in the future should take steps as soon as possible to be prepared, experts say.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe taxation change applies to the Department of Education's income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs. Enacted in the 90s, IDR plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and excuse any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years.\"A lot of people are very close to their 20- or 25-year mark,\" said Ethan Miller, a certified financial planner and founder of Planning for Progress in the Washington area. Miller specializes in student loans. \"Those are the folks who really need to be thinking about how the so-called tax bomb ... is going to impact them,\" he said.  Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program for government and nonprofit employees that eliminates federal loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments, remains tax-free.  The federal tax bill on student loan forgiveness could be substantial. The average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount forgiven would trigger a tax burden of more than $12,000, Kantrowitz estimated. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.Plus, some borrowers could incur state tax liability on their forgiven balance, experts say.   More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.Eligibility for student loan forgiveness in 2025 The new potential tax liability comes at the same time many student loan borrowers have faced delays in accessing debt forgiveness. But in a recent settlement between the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration, Education Department officials clarified that borrowers who became eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 won't owe federal taxes on the relief, even if their debt isn't officially discharged until later. That means if you received confirmation that you're eligible for debt cancellation in 2025, you should save that dated record, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.You may be able to use that document to prove you were entitled to the relief before the tax-free provision lapsed, Nierman said.Prepare for student loan forgiveness taxes Starting in 2026, student loan forgiveness counts as income, which could \"thrust your tax bracket up,\" depending on the size of your eliminated balance, said CFP and certified student loan professional Landon Warmund with Reliant Financial Services in Kansas City, Missouri.That could increase your tax bill and impact eligibility for various deductions and credits, he said. \"The biggest thing that I'm stressing for borrowers is that if you know this is going to come, be proactive with the planning,\" said Warmund, who is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. watch nowFirst, you'll need to know when you're eligible for IDR plan forgiveness. That could now be harder without the tracking tool previously available on StudentAid.gov, which was removed earlier this year, experts say. The Education Department \"currently has no plans to resume using the tool,\" according to a December court filing.  However, you can work with an advisor to figure out when you are eligible for forgiveness and start estimating the tax impact, depending on that year's income. Then you can begin setting money aside and explore IRS payment plan options. \"You need to be prepared for these tax liabilities,\" Warmund said. But you can \"get ahead of it and plan accordingly.\"",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein during a party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported.About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The review of the staggering number of files will take until at least Jan. 20 to complete, the Times reported. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23.The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender.While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted \"an exhaustive review\" of its files on Epstein.Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers \"are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.\"\"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche wrote, adding, \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.\"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19.The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the \"next couple weeks.\"\"I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said at the time.On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been \"uncovered\" and that it would take \"a few more weeks\" to release them.The document cited by Reuters on Wednesday said that the 400 additional lawyers are being provided by the DOJ's Criminal Division and National Security Division, as well as the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.Newly-released documents from disgraced late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including a sheaf of entirely redacted pages, are seen in handouts released by the Justice Department and printed and arranged for a photograph by Reuters in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe FBI declined to comment. The other divisions and the Manhattan office did not immediately respond to CNBC's outreach.Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time-off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said.After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated.The department said it \"is not redacting the names of any politicians\" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a \"cover-up to protect Donald Trump,\" a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification",

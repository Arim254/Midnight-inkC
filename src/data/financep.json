    "body": "I spent the last three years of my life researching money and wealth.During that time, I developed and battle-tested my own set of money principles, mindsets, tips, guardrails, and tools that helped me build a life that feels truly abundant.Here are 25 money rules I'm following to live a wealthy life.1. Avoid errorsYou can get pretty damn far by just avoiding errors: silly impulse purchases, avoidable debt, emotional investing, neglected responsibilities. Slow down, think clearly, and protect yourself from…yourself. 2. Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worthMarkets fluctuate. Seasons change. Businesses rise and fall. Your sense of worth must be anchored in something deeper: character, values, relationships, interests, service.3. Track progress You can't improve what you don't track. Use a financial tracking and management tool to get a clear picture.4. Live below your meansManage financial expectations by keeping your lifestyle well below your means, creating slack in the system, and never matching an economic leap forward with a lifestyle one.5. Focus on value, impact, and serviceThe people who do the best financially are usually the ones who obsess over solving real problems, creating real impact, or genuinely helping others. 6. Treat income as the leverage pointThe return on improving your skills, expanding your scope, building new earning streams, or stepping into higher-impact roles dwarfs the difference between a 6% or 8% market return.7. Spend more for quality, not for brandWhen purchasing products for their utility, always invest a bit more and opt for quality. They'll last longer and create fewer headaches. 8. Ignore external expectationsThe world is full of silent scripts about what you should buy, achieve, or own by certain ages. Most of them are complete nonsense. Your life is not a race with anyone else. There are no timelines. You get to create your own.9. Debt is a tool, but use it sparinglyNever use debt to live a life you can't truly afford. A simple rule I follow: Never finance a luxury material purchase if you can't buy it twice over in cash. 10. Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a certain thresholdThis reduces impulse purchases and improves saving and investing rates. If you still want to buy the thing after 24 hours, go for it.11. Consider time and moneyThere are some investments that require money and no time (index funds) and some that require money and a lot of time (active multi-family real estate). Make sure you consider both when evaluating returns on an opportunity.12. Remember that returns come in many formsEarly in my career, I started making angel investments in early stage technology companies. On paper, it didn't make a lot of sense: I didn't have much excess capital and I knew that most of the startups would fail. But what they lacked in financial returns, they made up for in access, networks, and learning.13. Never think twice about investments in yourselfThere are a lot of things that look like expenses but are better regarded as investments in yourself: fitness, quality food, books, personal development, mental health, etc. You'll have more energy, feel better, and show up better in the world.14. Never use money to optimize the life out of your lifeWhen you start making more money, an entire menu of options materializes to reduce life's minor frictions. You can hire a personal chef, a full-time cleaner, a staff, or a driver. But sometimes that friction was what created meaning. Cherish the meaningful friction in your life.15. Check in with your partnerMoney trouble rarely comes from math. It comes from misalignment. A monthly financial check-in creates transparency, trust, and shared direction. Focus on values. What matters this month? What doesn't? 16. Focus on expanding your savings rateEven small percentage increases have an outsized long-term impact when you consider the magic of compounding.17. Work toward a 12-month emergency fundIt may seem excessive, but there's value in peace of mind. Knowing you have that financial security allows you to see and capitalize on exciting opportunities when they come. 18. Run quarterly disaster simulationsYour willingness to imagine bad times during good times is what allows you to safely navigate them. What if you lost your job? What if you had a major healthcare expense? 19. Don't waste energy Bestselling financial author Ramit Sethi says people ask $3 questions (can I buy this coffee?) when what truly matters are $30,000 questions (how can I earn twice as much?). I see friends spending countless hours thinking about optimizing credit card points when they could be thinking about how to get promoted three times in the next year. Unless it brings you joy — some people love the game of credit card points — skip them.20. Consider a barbell approach to your investmentsA barbell has weights on the ends with nothing in between. A barbell investment approach would have the vast majority of your investments on the safe, simple, and steady side (e.g., index funds, bonds, cash) with the remainder having a high-risk, high-reward profile (e.g., startups, crypto). The goal is to get some exposure to the high rewards of the risky stuff, but without taking on too much risk because it's a small portion of your overall financial pie.21. SimplifyAccounts everywhere, investments you don't understand, obligations you can't track. This is how people lose control. Automate, consolidate, and reduce unnecessary friction. The simpler the system, the more likely you are to stay the course.22. Automate payments for recurring expensesEliminate the cognitive burden to free up headspace for executing on bigger opportunities that can help you earn more.23. Conduct a quarterly auditI've found hundreds of dollars in monthly burn through random subscriptions I never use and didn't know I had. Use your financial tracking tool to find and eliminate these.24. Tip generously whenever you canBe frugal with yourself and generous with others. Generosity creates significantly more happiness than consumption. 25. Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealthI believe the best uses of money are those that create one of four things in your life: time, experiences with people you love, purpose, or health.Sahil Bloom is an entrepreneur, investor, and inspirational writer and content creator who writes the biweekly newsletter, The Curiosity Chronicle.

    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out. States seeking a permanent board seat would have to pay a $1 billion fee.— Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Signage ahead of the Nvidia Live event at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia director Persis Drell, an engineering professor at Stanford, resigned on Wednesday after just over a decade on the chipmaker's board of directors, the company said in a filing with the SEC on Friday. Drell, 70, stepped down to pursue a \"new professional opportunity,\" Nvidia said, and not because of a disagreement with company or any matter related to its operations or policies. Drell, who served on the compensation committee, is the first Nvidia board member to depart since astronaut Ellen Ochoa resigned in June. The board now has 10 directors, including CEO Jensen Huang. Drell owns close to 143,000 Nvidia shares, worth about $26 million, according to the latest holdings report. She was paid about $344,000 for her work with Nvidia last year, including almost $259,000 in stock awards, the company's annual report said. Nvidia's stock price is up over 22,000% since the end of 2015, emerging as the most valuable company in the world thanks to the artificial intelligence boom. Drell sold about 40,000 shares last year. Drell has been a professor at Stanford since 2002, serving as the dean of the engineering school from 2014 to 2017 and as Stanford's provost from 2017 to 2023. She was also director of Stanford's particle accelerator, called SLAC, from 2007 to 2012. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Persis Drell is 70 years old. A previous version misstated her age. WATCH: Chinese AI models adapt without Nvidiawatch now",

Stock Market Value: ~$3.16B ($53.08 per share) Activist: Engaged Capital  Ownership: 2.02% Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Engaged Capital was founded by Glenn Welling, a former principal and managing director at Relational Investors. Engaged is an experienced and successful small-cap investor and makes investments with a two-to-five-year investment horizon. Its style is holding management and boards accountable behind closed doors. Engaged has an average return of 20.56% versus 17.83% for the Russell 2000. Of the firm's 39 past activist campaigns, nine of them have been at companies in the information technology sector.What's happeningOn Oct. 30, 2025, Engaged sent a letter calling on the BlackLine's board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP SE. Nearly a month later, Engaged issued a so-called 220 Demand letter requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election to BlackLine's board at the 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former senior vice president at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology-focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.Behind the scenesBlackLine provides financial accounting solutions delivered primarily as Software as a Service (SaaS). This is a very prototypical enterprise software business, characterized by high gross margins (80%) and sticky offerings that are essential for large enterprises. Its largest of these clients is SAP SE, with whom BlackLine has a strategic partnership that contributes approximately 30% of the company's revenue. Historically, the business was focused on growth, and rightfully so, as it was compounding revenue at over 20% annually for many years, and the stock price grew along with that success. By the end of 2020 BlackLine was trading around $133, and Marc Huffman, who led the company through the global pandemic, was promoted from president to CEO, replacing founder Therese Tucker who took on the role of executive chair of the board. However, post Covid, growth began to decelerate, margins did not come up meaningfully to compensate, and the stock fell accordingly, trading as low as roughly $61 in December 2022.BlackLine was rumored to have been thrown a life raft in 2022, when Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm known for taking positions in select technology companies as a prelude to an acquisition offer, took a roughly 9% public position in BlackLine. There was also speculation that this development piqued the interest of SAP. This seemed like perfect timing: BlackLine's hyper growth had severely slowed and multiples in the space were as high as ever. It is hard to know what type of discussions go on in a boardroom, but an acquisition never happened. In March 2023, Huffman was replaced when Tucker returned to the company in a co-CEO structure with former Deloitte consultant Owen Ryan (until October 2025 when he was made sole CEO). Since Tucker's return, growth has continued to decline to high single digits and while margins have improved modestly, the company's stock is down another 24%. Despite all of this, history repeated itself when it was recently reported that SAP made an offer to acquire BlackLine in June, this time for $66 per share, an over 30% premium to the 60-day trading average at the time. At the time, the company's growth rate was also much lower than it was in 2022, and industry multiples have compressed significantly. BlackLine, despite creating no value in public markets over the last several years, reportedly rejected the approach.This refusal is what prompted Engaged Capital to send a letter calling on the BlackLine board to immediately engage financial advisors and proactively run a strategic alternatives process following renewed acquisition interest from SAP. Engaged is not advocating for a sale of the company at any price, nor does the board have a legal duty to engage every acquisition offer. But conscientious shareholders certainly have the right to question how a board addresses a potential material transaction, particularly when they feel the board is not acting in the best interest of shareholders. Activist investors like Engaged do not view this as a right but an obligation. So, Engaged is asking the board to evaluate the SAP offer and weigh it against any other offers and on a risk-adjusted basis against a standalone path. This request is reasonable under almost any circumstances, but even more so when the potential acquirer is the company's most important business relationship. While SAP may be the most logical partner, and likely the one ultimately willing to pay the biggest premium (estimated to be in the mid-70s). Given their existing strategic partnership, BlackLine meets the profile of an ideal fit for private equity. With stable reoccurring revenue and modest growth, the value here is all in the margins, and PE firms have consistently demonstrated their ability to build software businesses with 20% EBITDA margins, like BlackLine, and expand them upwards of 40% once private, such as Vista/Blackstone at Smartsheet and Francisco Partners/TPG at New Relic. Notably, Clearlake Capital continues to own a 9.6% position in BlackLine. The firm has taken similar positions in companies like Cornerstone OnDemand, which it acquired in 2021, and Blackbaud, which rejected Clearlake's takeout offer in March 2023 and then again in 2024.A lot has happened since Engaged first presented this thesis last October. Shortly thereafter, BlackLine disclosed that it has maintained an independent strategic committee of the board for more than a year, with members including David Henshall, who is serving as chairperson, Greg Hughes and Tom Unterman. Notably, Henshall has a history of getting companies sold as a director, including New Relic when it was engaged by Engaged. Following this announcement, Engaged issued a 220 Demand letter to the company requesting access to board and strategic committee records related to all inbound acquisition interest, including a reported $66 per share offer from SAP SE on June 18, 2025. Engaged expressed concerns about the disclosures around the company's strategic committee, noting that BlackLine only recently revealed the committee's existence and has still not disclosed key information around it, including when it was formed, its purpose, the scope, its authority and whether it has retained advisors. Earlier this month, Engaged announced that it plans to nominate the following four director candidates for election at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting: (i) Christopher Hetrick, director of research at Engaged Capital; (ii) Christopher Young, former head of contested situations at Jefferies; (iii) Christopher Hallenbeck, former SVP at SAP SE; and (iv) Storm Duncan, founder of technology -focused M&A advisory firm Ignatious.When assessing Engaged's chances of success in a proxy fight, there are several dynamics to consider. First, in late December, Unterman announced that he will not stand for re-election as a member of the board at the company's 2026 Annual Meeting. His impending departure creates both a board vacancy in a seat up for election in 2026, so at worst for Engaged, it will be running its slate of four against three incumbents and a new nominee. Second, Engaged will likely get the support of Clearlake (9.6%), one of the company's largest shareholders. Third, there are signs of shareholder discontent, as CEO Ryan received over 20% withhold votes last time he was up for election. Finally, and most significant, one of the four directors up for election is founder Therese Tucker. If she sees the smallest sign of being ousted from the company she founded, it could lead to a quick settlement or a sale of the company. BlackLine added two new directors in June and July of 2025, which the company will undoubtedly argue is evidence of good corporate governance and board refreshment. However, these directors are in the class up for re-election in 2027, and good corporate governance would dictate that they are voted on in the 2026 election so not to be on the board for two years without shareholder approval. This is something we used to see more of and certainly will not see amid a proxy fight. Finally, it is important to note that one of the directors up for election this year is Scott Davidson who was appointed to the board last year as part of the Scalar Gauge settlement. By targeting him, Engaged cannot necessarily rely on Scalar Gauge's support, but that firm only owns a 1.15% stake.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

The man was later identified as ICU nurse Alex Pretti by his parents and the Associated Press.An undated handout image of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by U.S. immigration agents as they tried to detain him in Minneapolis, Minnesota, obtained by Reuters on Jan. 25, 2026.U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs | Via Reuters\"The only interaction that we are aware of with law enforcement has been for traffic tickets, and we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit,\" O'Hara said, though he noted details surrounding the encounter remain under review.O'Hara said his department has been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security, but that it has not provided specific details around the incident itself.The latest shooting adds to a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration agents that has persisted for weeks. Earlier this month, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, during an enforcement action, which triggered widespread protests and accelerated political backlash against the federal operation.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks by a screen showing an image of a handgun that the Department of Homeland Security says was recovered from a man who was shot during his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a press conference at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Response Coordination Center in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 24, 2026. Nathan Howard | Reuters\"At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement on X. \"An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here.\"Federal agents attempted to disarm the suspect but the suspect violently resisted, DHS said: \"More details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.\"About 200 protestors arrived at the scene, the department said, and \"crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement.\"Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that the federal agent involved in the shooting has been with the agency for eight years.Tear gas clouds during clashes between federal agents and community members at the scene of a shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 24, 2026. Tim Evans | ReutersTrump responded to the shooting in a Truth Social post, defending the federal operation and condemning criticism of his immigration enforcement surge.\"This is the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?\" he wrote. \"The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\"In a news conference Saturday evening, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem portrayed Pretti as a man intent on violence against federal agents: \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.\"When asked if the 37-year-old ever pointed his weapon at federal agents, Noem sidestepped the question and instead asked why an individual would bring a gun to a protest.But despite Noem's claims, multiple videos by bystanders and observers at the scene of the shooting published on social media appear to tell a different story. In one video obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at agents on Nicollet Avenue.The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.Soon, at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back, and another, who appears to have a canister in his hand, strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off of the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.In another video, seen by CNBC, it appears a federal officer removes a weapon from the man on the ground before any shots are fired. The DHS said it is planning to investigate the shooting, rather than the FBI, two sources told MS Now.In response to a request from Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, Walz on Saturday afternoon agreed to activate the Minnesota National Guard to support first responders. \"The Minnesota National Guard's role is to work in support of local law enforcement and emergency responders, providing additional resources. Their presence is meant to help create a secure environment where all Minnesotans can exercise their rights safely, including the right to peacefully protest,\" according to the sheriff department's statement.Minneapolis officials urged the public to avoid the area and remain calm as local law enforcement and state patrol units arrived to separate protesters from the ICE personnel, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., joined the governor's call for ICE to end its operations in Minnesota.\"The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW,\" she said in an X post.But Trump administration officials placed the blame for the shooting on the armed man. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"domestic terrorist,\" claiming that he \"tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

He said production efficiency, or yield, is also below his targets. \"We are on a multiyear journey,\" he said. \"It will take time and resolve.\"The chipmaker expects first-quarter revenue to range between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share to break even. That was below LSEG expectations for earnings of 5 cents per share and $12.51 billion in revenue.

    "body": "U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought.Kevin Mohatt | Kevin Lamarque | | ReutersSen. Elizabeth Warren on Friday accused the acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of undermining President Donald Trump's stated push to make credit cards more affordable, according to a letter obtained exclusively by CNBC.In a letter to acting CFPB Director Russell Vought, Warren, D-Mass., noted that in the last year the agency has dropped a rule limiting credit card late fees, sided with lenders in lawsuits over deceptive practices and paused enforcement actions against the industry.Earlier this month, Trump demanded in a social media post that U.S. banks voluntarily cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year. When they didn't, Trump this week called on lawmakers to pass legislation on the issue.\"I spoke with President Trump last week and told him that Congress could pass legislation to cap credit card rates, if he would fight for it,\" Warren wrote in her letter to Vought. \"While Congress considers legislation to address the issue, your own actions are directly undermining the President's stated goals,\" she wrote. \"Under your leadership, the CPFB has taken steps to make it easier—not harder—for big banks and credit card companies to rip off Americans.\"The letter from Warren seizes on Trump's pivot to affordability and seeks to leverage his initiative against his own administration, escalating tensions over the financial regulatory agency that she helped to create under the Obama administration. Members of the Trump administration have sought to shutter the CFPB as part of a broader pro-business deregulatory agenda.Current and former CFPB employees have said the agency is on life support under Vought, who has fought in court to enact mass layoffs and stop the agency's funding.An agency spokesperson said that the CFPB was disallowed from limiting credit card rates by the Dodd Frank Act.Vought should be \"using the full scope of [the CFPB's] authorities to address excessive credit card costs and to crack down on bad actors,\" instead of trying to dismantle the agency, Warren wrote.She directed Vought to \"immediately reinstate its rule capping credit card late fees at $8, which would save Americans more than $10 billion annually,\" Warren said.She contended Vought should also tamp down on deceptive practices around the industry's deferred interest promotions, resume enforcement of rules around monitoring interest rate increases, respond to a mounting pile of consumer complaints, and halt bait-and-switch tactics with rewards programs.\"Either President Trump is not serious about making credit cards more affordable or you are insubordinately disregarding his direction,\" she wrote.watch now",

Zhao was released in September 2024.Trump's pardon in October 2025 drew attention to Binance's ties to World Liberty Financial, a crypto company founded by the president's family.The connection stems from a $2 billion investment in March 2025 by state-owned firm MGX of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, into Binance.

We have a big flotilla going in that direction and we'll see what happens.\"Trump's comments come as more than 5,000 people have died in Iran since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency. \"They were going to hang 837 people,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. \"And I told them, you can't do that. If you do that, it's going to be bad.\" While the market is well supplied for the time being, OPEC and its allies, which pump about 40% of the world's oil, hiked their output last year, cutting into spare capacity.\"If we were to get a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran that led to the loss of Iranian oil exports, there just isn't a lot left in the OPEC tank to cover that,\" Croft said. Concerns around a larger regional conflict have also lifted prices given Iran's proximity to some of the world's largest oil producers -- namely Saudi Arabia.\"Iran's location is strategically very important when we think about critical waterways like the Strait of Hormuz, which is a major chokepoint for oil, and we have seen Iran and Iranian-backed groups before target tankers and target critical infrastructure in the Gulf,\" said Croft. In 2019, Iran launched a series of attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. About 20% of global crude flows through the narrow waterway, according to the EIA.Despite pulling back threats of military intervention, Trump confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday that 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Iran are \"going forward.\"Existing sanctions on Iran have already hampered the country's crude exports, with the vast majority going to independent Chinese refiners that buy the oil at a discount to benchmark prices.\"Can you really squeeze Iran much more given where their barrels are going?\" said Croft. \"[Have] sanctions now lost [the] ability to kind of move the needle when it comes to Iranian policy?\"Watch the video above to learn more about Iran's impact on oil markets and what it could mean for consumers.",

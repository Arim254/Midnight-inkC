    "body": "Dustin Muskovitz, co-founder and chairman at Asana.Stefanie Keenan | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeta's co-founder Dustin Moskovitz opened up about the pains of leadership and admitted that 13 years of being a CEO was \"exhausting.\"Moskovitz, one of the original founders of Meta, formerly Facebook, co-founded the social platform in 2004 alongside Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum.After leaving Facebook in 2008, he retained a stake of just over 8%, making him a billionaire with a net worth of $12 billion, according to the most recent data from Forbes. He went on to become a co-founder and CEO of work management software platform Asana the same year.Moskovitz announced his departure as Asana's CEO earlier this year and has transitioned into the role of chairman, while retaining an ownership of 53% of the company's outstanding shares between Class A and Class B holdings. The billionaire recently opened up about what it was like to be a CEO at Asana, while also having an introverted personality, on an episode of the Stratechery podcast by Ben Thompson, released on Monday.\"I don't like to manage teams, and it wasn't my intention when we started Asana,\" Moskovitz said during the episode.\"I'd intended to be more of a independent or head of engineering or something again. Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

    "body": "One in seven people have never spoken to their relatives about their family's health history, according to a recent global study from Bupa, a health insurance company. The survey polled 8,000 adults and 169 health professionals from the UK, Australia, Spain and more.Of the respondents, 30% said having a conversation about family health history had never crossed their minds and 20% said their families don't talk about health openly. \"Even though it's one in seven people, that person is connected to a family who hasn't had those conversations. So in some ways, it's kind of like one in seven families,\" says Sherry Pagoto, a licensed clinical psychologist who was involved in the study.About four in five (79%) of healthcare professionals polled agree that \"more lives could be saved if patients had better knowledge of their family health history,\" according to the study.With the knowledge of genetic health risks, doctors can make informed decisions like screening patients for specific conditions that run in their family, Pagoto says. But patients may not understand the importance of having those conversations or they may be uncomfortable to learn about their health histories, she adds.Another issue is \"not really knowing how to bring it up,\" says Pagoto who is also a professor in the department of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut. Some people may struggle with how to approach the topic and what to do with the information once they have it.Here are Pagoto's tips for starting the conversation about your genetic health risks with your family, and what she suggests for next steps.6 tips for talking to your family about genetic health risksBelieve that loved ones may be open to the conversation: \"People would be surprised at how open they may find family members to be of talking about themselves,\" Pagoto says. \"Particularly elderly family members.\"Check in with them about how they're currently feeling: Start with what's comfortable by asking, \"How are you feeling today?\" she suggests. You can ask about their most recent check-ups and what they discussed with their doctor.Introduce the topic of your family's health history: You can start the conversation with something like, \"I'd love to know more about any health conditions that you've had because those could run in the family,\" she suggests. Or you can ask what caused the death of specific family members to get more context.Take notes and document the information after: Approach this conversation \"almost like you're constructing this family tree, but of health conditions,\" Pagoto says. Having all of the information in one place makes it easy for you to share it with your doctor or with your siblings or your own children.Get other family members on board: If you speak to your maternal grandmother about that side of your family, maybe you can ask your siblings to speak to your paternal side, she notes. Delegating tasks will make it easier for you to get the knowledge you all need.Share what you learn with the right people: Once you know about your genetic health risks, it's important to share what you've learned with your doctor and your family members. Ask your doctor questions like \"Are there any tests or screenings that we should do for me right now?\" or \"What recommendations do you have for [prevention]?\"Remember that what you learn about your family's health history is only context, and not a prediction of what you can expect in your own future, Pagoto says. \"Your genes are not your fate. They're one part of an equation. Your lifestyle and your health care is a big part of that equation,\" she explains.\"It might actually make you feel more motivated to do these healthy lifestyle behaviors that we sometimes feel like 'I'm not motivated for that' or 'I don't have time for that'. It really pops it up on the top of your priority list.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A view of the logo of HSBC bank on a wall outside a branch in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 14, 2024.Henry Romero | ReutersHSBC said on Monday that it will recognize a provision of $1.1 billion in its third quarter results following a court ruling in Luxembourg related to the Bernard Madoff investment fraud case.Herald Fund SPC sued HSBC's Luxembourg unit in 2009, claiming restitution of securities and cash it said were lost in the fraud.The court denied HSBC unit's appeal in respect of Herald's securities restitution claim, but accepted the unit's appeal in respect of the cash restitution claim.The bank will now pursue a second appeal before the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and added that if unsuccessful, it would contest the amount to be paid in subsequent proceedings.Madoff was described as the mastermind of the largest investment fraud in U.S., defrauding clients of as much as $65 billion. He pleaded guilty in 2009 to a scheme that started in the early 1970s, ripping off more than 40,000 people in 125 countries over four decades, before being caught on Dec. 11, 2008.Madoff, whose victims included director Steven Spielberg and actor Kevin Bacon, was sentenced to 150 years in prison. He passed away in 2021.In its interim report for 2025 released in July, HSBC said Herald had claimed a restitution of securities and cash of $2.5 billion plus interest, or damages of $5.6 billion plus interest from HSBC.HSBC, Europe's largest lender, said that various non-U.S. HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds whose assets were invested with Bernard Madoff Investment Securities.The news comes a day before HSBC is due to announce its results, with the bank saying that the $1.1 billion provision will impact its Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio by about 15 basis points. The CET1 ratio is a measure of a bank's financial strength, and is used to determine its ability to withstand distress.Estimates from analysts compiled by the bank on Oct. 17 had forecast CET1 ratio for the third quarter to come in at 14.5%, compared to 14.6% in the second quarter.Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at Morningstar, told CNBC that she does not think that the $1.1 billion charge would have an impact on operations, but it could weigh on sentiment slightly as HSBC was \"hoping that these one-off impairments were cleaned up after the interim write-offs.\"HSBC's allowance for expected credit losses as of June increased by $500 million compared with Dec. 31, including adverse foreign exchange movements of 400 million, and write-offs of $2 billion, according to the bank's interim report.Morningstar's assumption is that HSBC CET1 ratio will be at around 14.4% for the third quarter, and hover at the 14% over the next 10 years.HSBC, which said that the final financial impact from the ruling could be \"significantly different,\" given the pending appeals, is currently undergoing a restructuring under CEO Georges Elhedery, and will see the bank split its operations into four divisions.The bank has said the reorganization will cut costs by about $300 million this year, creating separate \"Eastern markets\" and \"Western markets\" sectors.HSBC shares in Hong Kong were trading 0.29% lower.— CNBC's Marty Steinberg and Scott Cohn contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Employees work on the assembly line of new energy vehicles at a factory of Chinese EV startup Leapmotor on April 1, 2024 in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province of China.Shi Kuanbing | VCG | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's industrial profits soared 21.6% in September from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, as Beijing's campaign to curb price wars helped ease pressure on manufacturers despite persistent trade tensions with the U.S.That sharp jump, extending a strong rebound that began in August when the industrial profits jumped 20.4% year-on-year, marked the biggest gain since November 2023.For the first nine months of the year, profits at major industrial firms grew 3.2%, the official data showed, accelerating from a 0.9% rise in the January to August period.The rebound in corporate profitability was largely helped by Beijing's policies aimed at curtailing fierce price competition across industrial sectors, at a time when deflation in producer prices stretched into its third year. China's consumer prices fell more than expected in September, slipping 0.3% from a year earlier, while the producer price index slumped 2.3%.Profits for the manufacturing sector jumped 9.9% from a year earlier in the January to September period, and earnings from electricity, heat, fuel and water supply companies climbed 10.3%. The mining sector, however, saw profits drop 29.3%.Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, said high-tech manufacturing helped drive broader profit growth, with sector earnings surging 26.8% in September.Among industrial firms, profits at state-owned enterprises dipped 0.3%, compared with gains of 4.9% for foreign industrial firms — including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan — and 5.1% for private companies.Chinese manufacturers have weathered uncertain trade policies with the U.S. and tepid consumer confidence at home as the world's second-largest economy grappled with a prolonged housing downturn, weak labour market conditions and growing headwinds on its exports.While the country's overall exports have remained resilient this year, analysts expect the trade growth to slow in the final quarter, in part due to the high base last year.\"We expect export growth to slow in Q4, after an increase to 6.6% y-o-y in Q3 from 6.2% in Q2, due to a high base and rising trade barriers globally,\" said a team of economists at Nomura.China's economy expanded 4.8% in the third quarter, marking the slowest rate in a year. Fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year — the first such decline since 2020 during the pandemic — according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.Industrial output grew faster than expected in September, climbing 6.5% from a year ago, and up from 5.2% growth in the previous month.The resilient headline figures suggest Beijing may not see much urgency in rolling out more stimulus measures to achieve its growth target of around 5% for this year, analysts said.While Chinese policymakers pledged to boost domestic demand at a high-profile economic planning meeting earlier this month, they also stressed the need for technological breakthroughs and for upgrading the country's industrial capabilities.\"References to 'expanding domestic demand' and 'improving livelihoods' are present but comparatively much less prominent,\" said Louise Loo, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics.\"These suggest that while policymakers recognise weak household sentiment and a savings overhang, they don't envision large-scale consumption stimulus over the next five years,\" Loo added.",

    "body": "Signage for Novartis AG at a building in the company's headquarters campus in Basel, Switzerland, on Monday, Jan. 8, 2023. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has agreed to buy biotechnology company Avidity Biosciences for about $12 billion, the company said Sunday.Novartis will pay Avidity shareholders $72 a share in cash, a premium of 46% to the company's Friday closing price.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after Avidity spins out parts of its business, including its early-stage precision cardiology programs, the company said in a statement. \"The Avidity team has built robust programs with industry-leading delivery of RNA therapeutics to muscle tissue,\" Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said in the statement. \"We look forward to developing these programs to meaningfully change the trajectory of diseases for patients.\"Novartis has raised the forecast for its sales compound annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029 to 6% from 5% as a result of the acquisition.Bloomberg News first reported the companies were nearing a deal, citing a person familiar with the matter. Novartis and Avidity didn't immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.Avidity specializes in developing an innovative class of ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics called antibody oligonucleotide conjugates. RNA-based therapeutics are a relatively new class of medications that work by altering how genes are expressed to treat or prevent diseases.The Avidity deal comes as Novartis ramps up its research and development division. The company earlier this year pledged to invest $23 billion to build out its U.S.-based infrastructure, which includes plans to construct a second R&D hub in San Diego.The pharmaceutical giant has also struck two key deals with Anthos Therapeutics and Regulus Therapeutics this year to boost its development and manufacturing of cardiovascular and kidney disease drugs.Avidity shares closed at $49.15 on Friday. The stock, which has a market capitalization of roughly $7.2 billion, is up nearly 70% since the beginning of the year. Novartis shares closed at $130.36 on Friday.",

    "body": "Saying \"no\" is essential in parenting. But setting limits shouldn't start and end with that one word.As a certified child life specialist and licensed therapist, I know that saying \"no\" is meant to help kids feel safe, supported, and understood. I often help kids understand: \"Your parents aren't saying 'no' to control you, they're saying 'no' to support you.\"Boundaries deepen trust and cooperation over time. When we say \"no\" with calm, consistency, and care, we're setting limits. But we're also teaching emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. These are crucial skills our kids will carry far beyond childhood. Here's how to say no in ways that build connection instead of conflict. Turn 'no' into a teachable momentThink about a curious one-year-old who's putting sand in their mouth, pulling the dog's tail, or standing on a chair. If we just say \"no\" or \"stop\" without explaining, we might leave them feeling confusion, shame, or doubt.Instead we might say \"not in the mouth,\" \"gentle hands,\" or \"sit down.\" It's still a boundary but it teaches and guides them in a way they can learn and understand. When kids aren't adhering to limits, they might need firmer boundaries. But those can still help them figure out what to do, rather than just what not to do. For example: \"No helmet, no bike.\" \"It's not safe to ride without a helmet, so I'm going to put the bike away for now.\" \"As soon as you put your helmet on, you can ride your bike.\"Explain the 'why'Kids crave reasoning to make sense of things. Limits work best when kids understand them. With my two young children, I always lead with limits related to safety and kindness. This helps me stay mindful of when and why I'm saying \"no\" in the first place, and whether or not certain limits are negotiable. Recently, my five-year-old asked for emotional support while I was driving. I said, \"I can't hold your hand when I'm driving because it's not safe. But as soon as we get home, I can give you a hug.\" It was still a \"no,\" but it prioritized connection and safety. When kids know why, they're more likely to accept the limit even if they don't like it. This can teach them perspective-taking. For screens, helmets, and more, it might also mean explaining that \"every family has different rules, and these are ours.\" Offer control through choicesWhen kids hear the word \"no,\" they immediately feel stripped of autonomy and control — often when they're trying to explore their world and build their identity.Pair limits with choices. That can sound like:\"The park isn't a choice right now, you can choose to play in the backyard or in the basement.\"\"Choose one more thing to do and then it's time to leave.\"When kids struggle to decide, you can always resort to: \"You can choose or I can choose for you.\"Kids will feel empowered by being able to make a choice within the boundaries you've clearly set. Be consistent Toddlers test every limit, every day. And it doesn't stop after toddlerhood. It's a sign of healthy development, and it looks different at different ages and stages.This is how kids learn what's safe and where the boundaries are. When limits change easily, kids push harder. When limits are consistent, they learn to trust and expect them.Our job as parents is to communicate consistently, calmly, and clearly even when kids melt down or fight back. It teaches them that their world is safe and predictable, even when it's upsetting, and shows them unwavering support in the face of challenges.Repair when you react Sometimes we shout \"no!\" instinctively in moments of stress or fear, like when a child is running toward the street.It's natural to react that way, but it's essential to follow up with an explanation and perhaps even an apology. When my daughter recently tugged on a necklace that's already broken twice, I added: \"I'm worried it will break. It's special to me and costs money to fix.\" She said, \"I'm sorry mama. It was an accident. I won't do it again.\"Repairing and explaining after an emotional \"no\" can teach kids about accountability and empathy in a relationship and demonstrate reflection and correction.Stay firm as they get olderAs kids grow and develop, boundaries may look and sound different but the underlying message is the same.A \"no\" to going to the park after school might sound like, \"I hear you, but that's not an option today. We already have plans.\" Similarly, when it's time to end an activity: \"We're all done now\" or \"It's time to go home.\" You can even validate their feelings while staying firm: \"It's okay to be upset, but it's not going to change the plans. I'm right here with you.\"These honest conversations around limits teach kids that boundaries and connection can exist together — a lesson that will serve them through every stage of life. Kelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ... Never have been, never will be.\"Mellon's contribution aims to help cover the cost of U.S. military personnel's salaries and benefits as the federal shutdown drags on.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe donation might have violated the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from spending funds that have not been appropriated by Congress, the Times reported.Mellon's gift is also unlikely to go far in offsetting the cost of military pay.There are more than 1.3 million troops in the active-duty military, and the Trump administration's 2025 budget included a request of around $600 billion in military compensation, the Times reported.Mellon, whose grandfather, Andrew Mellon, was one of the longest-serving Treasury secretaries, is a longtime Trump donor.He contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, one of the biggest single donations ever publicly shared, The Times reported.A spokesman for Sen. Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

    "body": "European consumers are facing higher prices when going to the supermarket.Andia | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesRelations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.\"Tourists are very important, and especially English people,\" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.\"These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,\" he said.\"And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,\" he added.A cheesemonger working in a cheese store in Paris, France, in 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were \"very, very strict\" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.\"We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.\"Why the ban?Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.Not taking any chances: Cars pass through at a disinfection checkpoint set up on the border crossing between Hungary and Slovakia on March 28, 2025 in Medvedov, Slovakia. The country declared a state of emergency after several cases of foot and mouth disease in the region, including a new outbreak detected in Hungary, close to the Slovak border near Bratislava.Robert Nemeti | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that \"while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.\"While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.\"Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,\" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.\"We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,\" the spokesperson added.Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's \"FMD response remains under constant review\" and that it will \"retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.\"Hard lessonsThe U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.Cows of Breier Cattle Farm are pictured at a farm near Budapest on March 11, 2025. Hungary detected its first foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in over 50 years on March 7, 2025, at a cattle farm near the Slovak border. The country's food safety agency, introduced extremely strict measures to prevent the further spread of the disease, including a ban on the movement of susceptible species. Ferenc Isza | Afp | Getty ImagesThe 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.",

    "body": "The stock market has been volatile lately as investors study the latest twists and turns in the the U.S.-China trade war as well as earnings of major American companies. Despite those challenges, investors can also choose to focus on stocks of companies that can navigate short-term pressures to deliver strong, long-term returns.Tracking top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick some attractive stocks, as the recommendations of these experts are based on in-depth analysis of a company's business fundamentals, opportunities and challenges.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.PinterestThis first stock pick is social media company Pinterest (PINS), scheduled to announce third-quarter results on November 4. Heading into those numbers, TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated a buy rating on Pinterest and a $44 price target. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Pinterest, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $40.Blackledge expects Pinterest Q3 revenue grew by 16.6% versus the year-earlier quarter, in line with the Street's consensus estimate and toward the high end of the company's own guidance. \"We expect EBITDA growth of 20% y/y, outpacing rev growth, driven by modest [cost of revenue] and R&D leverage,\" said Blackledge.  The 5-star analyst remains confident about his mid-teens, year-over-year revenue growth estimate through the second half of 2025 and 2026, partly supported by continued adoption by advertisers of PINS' Performance+ campaign tools.Following a digital ad check call with an agency that runs more than $4 billion annually in managed advertising spending, Blackledge noted that ad spend on Pinterest rose 63% year-over-year in Q3 2025, a slight slowdown compared to 66% in the prior quarter. A TD Cowen expert noted that solid uptake continues in PINS' Performance+ campaign types.In fact, some advertisers have shifted all their Pinterest spending to Performance+. Blackledge said Performance+, rolled out in late 2024 with automated creative tools, has expanded to include automated bidding tools and other artificial intelligence (AI)-driven automated features.Blackledge ranks No. 522 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.5%. See Pinterest Statistics on TipRanks.Uber TechnologiesNext up is ride-sharing and delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). Recently, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated a buy rating on UBER along with a 12-month price forecast of $150 after hosting a quarterly webinar with Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy and The Driverless Digest Dude, where they discussed the latest trends across rideshare, delivery and autonomous vehicle (AV) ecosystems. Like Mahaney, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on UBER stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $108.Campbell was constructive about rideshare supply dynamics, given solid and stable driver economics, Mahaney noted. Campbell continues to see consistent demand and strong driver supply, particularly at Uber, which he described as operating near \"all-time highs.\" Despite robust supply, pricing continues to be high, reflecting sustained demand elasticity and limited alternatives for consumers, particularly for airport and nightlife rides. The top-rated analyst also highlighted Campbell's commentary about early-stage shifts in AV partnerships — particularly Alphabet's Waymo's evolving first-party vs third-party strategy and Uber's expanding AV integration roadmap.Mahaney further noted stable driver economics and widening platform margins. Notably, Uber's \"decoupling\" of rider fares and driver payouts is driving incremental profit margin expansion, even with steady driver income.Through incremental feature innovation, Uber is focused on enhancing ecosystem \"stickiness.\" Uber's recent \"Only on Uber\" event rolled out small feature updates, including tip guarantees and safety enhancements. While not transformative, Mahaney said Campbell sees these efforts as part of Uber's \"broader push to create alternative income channels for drivers as AVs grow share over time.\"Mahaney ranks No. 473 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13%. See Uber Technologies Financials on TipRanks.General MotorsGeneral Motors (GM) jumped 15% on Tuesday after the Cadillac and Buick parent beat the Street's revenue and earnings expectations despite a slight decline in sales. GM also raised its forward guidance, citing a lower-than-expected tariff impact.  Following the Q3 results, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a buy rating on GM and raised his price target to $76 from $67. By comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a price target of $66 and an \"outperform\" rating on GM.\"We remain positive with reduced tariff burden/risk, improved profitability and [internal combustion engine] SUV/pickup onshoring tailwinds through C26E+,\" said Rakesh.The 5-star analyst noted that GM raised its 2025 guidance for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings per share (EPS) and adjusted free cash flow, driven by a smaller-than-expected impact from  tariffs, and said GM is rolling back some of its electric vehicle (EV) plans to boost profitability. That involves GM's sale of its Michigan EV battery plant stake to LG Energy, while keeping two battery plants, and transitioning its Orion plant to gas engine production from an EV focus by 2027.Rakesh believes that smaller EV losses, tariff challenges and warranty costs, and a higher combustion engine mix, will support GM's target to return to 8% to 10% EBIT margin in the North America business. Other tailwinds include $5 billion in deferred revenue from OnStar and Super Cruise models, with about 70% gross margins, combined with a stable average selling prices.Rakesh ranks No. 67 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.8%. See General Motors Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.",

The segment also provides services to commercial nuclear clients.Stock Market Value: $7.89 billion ($48.79 per share)Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: Starboard ValueAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power, which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.Behind the scenesFluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile. Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion. As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company. Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval. As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value. If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times. Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation. Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential. Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside. Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000. But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that the president will disclose his contribution.The White House has released a list of donors that include Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta.Alphabet is contributing $22 million which represents about 7% of the project's estimated cost. Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney waves next to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 7, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he was slapping an extra 10% tariff on imports from Canada in retaliation for what he says is a misleading TV ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.\"Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement in Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.Canada generally pays a 35% tariff on goods sold in the U.S., with exceptions for certain products covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and other specific product exceptions, such as steel and aluminum, which are tariffed at 50%.Trump late Friday blasted the Ontario provincial government in Canada for waiting until after the first two games of the World Series to pause the Reagan ad.\"They could have pulled it tonight,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he headed to fly to Asia.\"Well, that's dirty play,\" he said. \"But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.\"Trump had cited the ad in his decision on Thursday night to trade negotiations with Canada.Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Friday afternoon said he would pause the ad on Monday so that trade talks could resume.But Ford also said, \"I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"Trump said Friday night that he had heard that Ontario was pulling the ad.But he also said he did not know the government was leaving it on until Monday.The ad was shown Friday night during a broadcast to millions of Americans of the first game of the World Series.That game was won 11-4 by Canada's Toronto Blue Jays over the U.S.'s Los Angeles Dodgers.Toronto is in Ontario, and is the hometown of Ford.Ford, in a tweet earlier Friday announcing the ad pause, said, \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said, apparently referring to Trump.\"In speaking with Prime Minister [Mark] Carney, Ontario will pause its U.S. advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

But the ad accurately captures Reagan saying, \"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"The ad also has Reagan, from the same speech, saying, \"When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.\"\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said in the speech and in the ad.Ford, who calls himself a \"big Ronald Reagan fan,\" first posted the ad on X on Oct. 16, days after saying that Ontario's government would spend $75 million to run the ad in the United States.\"We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country,\" said Ford.Trump raged about the ad in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!! They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,\" Trump wrote.\"Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs, charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they, and other countries, can't take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.\"The Supreme Court in early November is set to hear oral arguments in a case that will determine if Trump had power under the law to impose sweeping tariffs against scores of countries, including Canada, without the consent of Congress.",

    "body": "watch nowIRVINE, Calif. — Taco Bell is going all in on beverages, starting with its Live Más Café concept.The Yum Brands chain unveiled the drink-focused store format last December, with the first location in Chula Vista, California. Ten months later came the second location, near the University of California, Irvine campus. By the end of the year, Taco Bell is projecting that it will have 30 Live Más Cafés in its portfolio, across Southern California, Dallas and Houston.Unlike McDonald's now-defunct CosMc's spinoff, which had its own standalone locations, the Live Más Café lives inside existing Taco Bell restaurants. Customers order at kiosks and can watch the \"bellristas\" assemble their drinks from behind the designated counter, which takes prime real estate in the store. The drink menu includes a range of beverage options, from blended coffees to lemonade-based drinks.The beverage-focused concept is supposed to help the Mexican-inspired chain reach its goal of generating a $5 billion drink business by 2030. Taco Bell first disclosed that target in March at an investor day, where the chain shared more about its plans to keep growing as it fuels Yum's operating profit growth.So far this year, Taco Bell has sold more than 600 million beverages, up 16% from the year-ago period, according to the company. More than 60% of the chain's orders this year have included a drink, Taco Bell said.\"I think drinks are big right now because I think people are really craving unique, interesting flavors in their beverages, and we hear that all the time from our consumers,\" said Liz Matthews, global chief food innovation officer for Taco Bell.Center stageTaco Bell's Live Más Café.Courtesy: Taco BellStepping inside the Irvine location, the Live Más Café beverage station is the clear star.Most of the self-order kiosks are positioned in front of the station's long counter. Customers have a free view of the \"bellristas\" making their specialty drinks, unlike the restaurant's other employees who assemble Crunchwrap Supremes and Chalupas hidden from sight.Digital menu boards across the restaurant highlight the beverage offerings. The drink menu spans four distinct categories: churro chillers, specialty coffees, refrescas and \"bellrista favorites.\"The churro chillers are creamy and cold milkshakes topped with churro chunks. The specialty coffees come either hot, iced or blended as a \"chiller.\" Brightly colored refrescas use either lemonade, green tea or Rockstar energy drinks as the base for their fruity flavors, such as strawberry passionfruit or mango peach. And the \"bellrista favorites\" include seasonal options, such as the autumnal caramel apple empanada churro chiller, which incorporates blended chunks of Taco Bell's apple empanada.When crafting the menu, Matthews and her team tried to stick to the chain's Mexican-inspired roots, but she said Taco Bell will always have a \"playful spirit.\"And while the Live Más Café offers plenty of options with a variety of flavors, Taco Bell kept the options to customize minimal.\"What we found when we talked to consumers, they actually really want us to curate their drink for them,\" Matthews said.To date, the Irvine location's top-selling drinks are the Mexican Chocolate Churro Chiller, the Dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast Dream Soda and the Mango Peach Agua Refresca. Six of the top 10 bestselling drinks at the location are chillers. That's a reversal from the initial test location in Chula Vista, which has seen similar demand for every drink category, according to Matthews.Since its opening day in September, the Irvine location has been selling more than 900 drinks per day, according to Taco Bell. More than a third of orders include an item from the Live Más Café menu.Meanwhile, the Chula Vista location — which exceeded its initial sales forecast by four times — is selling more than 750 beverages a day nearly a year since its opening, the company said. A quarter of all transactions include a Live Más Café beverage, according to Taco Bell.\"Given what we're seeing right now from the business results, the payback looks really attractive and in line with what our franchisees would expect for something big, but we've got a lot more to learn,\" said Taylor Montgomery, global chief brand officer of Taco Bell.'Little treat'This year, the hottest trend in fast food hasn't been a chicken sandwich or plant-based burgers. Instead, beverages of all consistencies, colors and nutritional values have taken the spotlight.For example, Shake Shack is selling lemonade with mini raspberry popping boba, inspired by the success of bubble tea. Panera Bread is testing frescas and energy refreshers in select bakery-cafés. Chick-fil-A is planning to open Daybright — a beverage-focused restaurant with specialty coffees, smoothies and cold-pressed juices — in Hiram, Georgia, later this year. And although McDonald's this summer wound down its spin-off called CosMc's that focused on drinks and snacks, it also tested new coffee drinks, refreshers and flavored sodas at more than 500 U.S. restaurants.The number of beverages sold by the top 500 chains has climbed more than 9% in the last year, according to Technomic. The swell of beverage innovation follows the speedy expansion of a number of a specialty drink chains, from upstart 7 Brew Coffee to dirty-soda inventor Swig.\"[Quick-service chains] have seen that there's a big opportunity with an entire generation and how they're interested in that 'little treat' culture,\" said Claire Conaghan, \"trendologist\" at Datassential, which tracks menu trends. \"There's options to kind of go beyond their focus area of core meal and really lean into that snacking moment.\"Generation Z and millennials are driving the trend, according to Varchasvi Singh, a foodservice analyst for Mintel. Younger generations enjoy customizing their food and beverage orders.\"Among younger consumers, in particular, we see that fast-food dining is just as much about experimentation and novelty as it is about indulgence,\" Singh said. \"They're a lot more open to trying premium menu items and personalizing their orders, whereas older generations, who have associated fast food with extreme affordability for a long time, are a little bit more critical of how expensive it has become for them.\"For Taco Bell, turning to beverages and creating the Live Más Café is part of its broader plan to appeal to younger consumers, whose spending power is projected to increase rapidly in just a few years.\"Over the past five years, we've really, really been transitioning and thinking about the brand and how to position it for Gen Z, and so Café was really born from that,\" Montgomery said. \"I think it's something like 60% of Gen Z consumers come to a restaurant or [quick-service restaurant] for an afternoon treat.\"Rather than creating a standalone Live Más Café, Taco Bell chose to put the sub-brand inside existing restaurants in part because of \"humility,\" according to Montgomery.\"Today, we're not known to be a beverage destination — yet,\" he told CNBC.Live Más Café can also help Taco Bell more broadly.\"It also acts a little bit as a test market where they can get some more real-time data. Which combos do people do the most?\" Conaghan said. \"Which customizations matter the most? Do we need every type of alternative milk or maybe just these one or two? Do we need all 15 flavors of whatever energy refresher?\"That's already started happening. Taco Bell's agua frescas, which began as a Live Más Café menu line, have since been launched nationwide.\"They're one of our top-selling items, and we didn't wait to scale the Café,\" Montgomery said. \"We pushed those in all the restaurants, and we've seen success there.\"Plus, the coffee options on the café's menu are part of Taco Bell's plan to make a bigger push into breakfast. The chain started serving the morning meal more than a decade ago but told franchisees last year that they could opt out serving breakfast; for some fast-food operators, opening early isn't profitable, plus there's the added headache of finding staff willing to work the morning shift.Taco Bell has already had some success with another sub-brand. Its Cantina format, typically found in cities, features a custom menu, alcoholic beverages and seating meant to encourage customers to linger. Since opening the first location in Chicago a decade ago, Taco Bell Cantina has grown to dozens of restaurants.Broadly, even as inflation-weary consumers pull back their spending, Taco Bell's focus on new menu items has lifted its sales; earlier this year, the company announced plans to double innovation in 2025. Taco Bell's prices have climbed 75.5% since 2019, according to Technomic's Ignite Menu. Still, customers keep coming back.In recent years, Taco Bell has been the gem of Yum's portfolio, typically outperforming both Wall Street's expectations and its sister chains, KFC and Pizza Hut. Executives have named the chain as one of the company's primary growth engines. In the second quarter, while many fast-food rivals reported shrinking sales, Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 4%.\"From a portfolio standpoint, we represent a pretty significant amount of Yum's operating profit, but we learn a lot from other brands, too,\" Montgomery said.Yum is expected to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell on Nov 4.Watch the video to learn more about why Taco Bell is betting on drinks.",

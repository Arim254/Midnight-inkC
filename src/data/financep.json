    "body": "Sign at the entrance to a Capital One Bank branch in Manhattan. Erik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesBanks and financial services stocks slid Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates at 10%. Capital One shares dropped 10% in premarket trading. Citigroup lost 4% and JPMorgan Chase shed nearly 3%. Bank of America fell 2.36%, Visa declined 1.94%, and Mastercard was 2.21% in the red.Financial services names were also affected as American Express fell 4.87%, Wells Fargo lost 2.01% and Morgan Stanley declined 0.98%. The cap would come into force on Jan. 20., according to a post on Truth Social on Friday, though Trump did not provide additional details on how it would work. \"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" Trump wrote, echoing a pledge he made during the 2024 presidential campaign. \"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies,\" he added.A cap would require approval from Congress. There has long been interest in curbing fees, and bipartisan bills to cap credit card interest rates at 10% have previously been introduced, highlighting potential appetite for the move.When asked about his post, Trump said Sunday to reporters that if banks don't limit rates they would be \"in violation of the law.\"Critics said over the weekend that Trump's plan, if enacted, would cause banks to pull back on lending, causing many consumers to lose access to credit.The buy-now-pay-later stocks were higher in early trading on the notion more consumers would be forced to use those short-term lenders.Affirm Holdings jumped 5% in premarket trading. PayPal added 1%.",

    "body": "A snow-cleared asphalt road outside Sisimiut, Greenland, on Monday, March 31, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGreenland has been thrust into a geopolitical firestorm as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up his threats to annex the self-governing Danish territory.But, while Trump says the U.S. needs the huge Arctic island for its national security, and European leaders have responded that security is a collective endeavor, independence for the island of just 57,000 people remains a long-term goal.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.The White House has said Trump and his national security team are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland — and that while diplomacy is the first option, all options, including military force, were on the table.\"For many years, the majority of Greenlanders have been fighting for our right to represent ourselves,\" Aaja Chemnitz, a pro-independence MP and one of two lawmakers in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told CNBC by video call.\"We say nothing about us without us — and that's why it's important for us to still fight for making sure that we have even more autonomy in the time to come,\" she added. watch nowChemnitz said the \"U.S. used to be a very close ally just a year ago,\" and that Greenlanders wanted to \"make sure that we're not dehumanized, which I think we have been in this whole situation.\"\"Greenland never has been for sale and never will be for sale,\" she added. \"The people are resilient. And I think it's important to remember that, of course, you can't buy a country, but you can also not buy a population.\"Greenland was granted greater autonomy over its affairs through the Self-Government Act in 2009, a motion that enables the island the right to hold an independence referendum. Denmark, however, remains responsible for its foreign, defense and security policies. Lawmakers presented a draft constitution in 2023 for an independent Greenland, but there were no immediate plans to adopt it. To be sure, most Greenlandic political parties support independence, but disagree over when and how to reach it. Indeed, the independence movement has become something of a balancing act between the island's ultimate goal of self-determination and the need for Denmark's financial support for essential welfare services, such as health and education. Last January, Greenland's then-Prime Minister Múte Egede said that it was time to take the next step toward independence. His successor, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who led the center-right Democrats to a surprise victory in parliamentary elections last March, favors a more gradual path. Read moreChemnitz, a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party and chair of the Greenland Committee, told CNBC that the Arctic island's independence push is a long-term goal, given the need to be on \"good economic terms\" to maintain living standards.Trump previously sought to buy Greenland in 2019 during his first term as U.S. president, only to be told the island was not for sale.Now, the prospect of U.S. military action in Greenland has triggered a strong response from Denmark, with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that a U.S. attack would mark the end of the NATO military alliance.Approximately 1,500 protesters rally outside the U.S. Embassy, condemning U.S. pressure on Greenland and Denmark and denouncing the U.S. government's controversial visit to Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on March 29, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe issue has raised alarm in Europe, particularly given that Trump's renewed interest follows a U.S. military operation in Venezuela to depose that country's president, Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 3.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that he intends to hold talks with Danish officials to discuss the Arctic island.Trump's takeover threatsClayton Allen, head of practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said that like many externally governed territories, there would always be some political appetite for independence.\"I'm not sure that pressures from the U.S. for greater sovereign control of Greenland are necessarily going to be the way that they want to do that,\" Allen told CNBC by video call.\"Put simply, I don't know that people are going to want to trade one foreign power for another. If you want to be independent, you want to be independent,\" he added. watch nowOtto Svendsen, associate fellow with the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said external observers should tread carefully when assessing the impact of Trump's takeover threats on Greenland's independence movement.He told CNBC the movement has been \"present for decades\" and has secured a commitment from the Danish government to respect the results of any independence referendum.Svendsen added the feeling in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, was that Trump's \"very overt attempts to bring Greenland closer to the United States\" would harm the prospects of independence, as \"one of the best cards up the sleeves of the government in Nuuk is to rely on the deterrent value of Denmark.\"",

You know we have so many that want it. I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,\" Trump told reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday. \"They're playing too cute,\" he added. His comments come shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares were last seen 1.1% lower in premarket trade on Monday.Speaking alongside several other American oil executives on Friday, Woods said Exxon would need to see \"some pretty significant changes\" if it was to re-enter the country for a third time. Venezuela seized Exxon's and ConocoPhillips's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.

    "body": "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a House Homeland Security hearing entitled \"Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.  Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday. \"We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,\" Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot.\"If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,\" Noem claimed in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"This officer was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.\" Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda. The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud.Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, \"Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseDemocrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" demanded an impartial investigation of the incident.\"Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased,\" he said. \"Let's not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice.\" \"When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,\" Frey added.Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions. \"They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,\" Frey said.Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. Frey called for ICE to \"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,\" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\"They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public,\" Noem said on CNN Sunday. \"They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days.\"Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, \"I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears.\"\"I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. I think the 'killing somebody' is the inflammatory element here, not the F-bomb,\" Frey said. On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should \"let the investigation play out.\"\"I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't,\" Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal.This story is developing.

    "body": "Jersey Mike's Subs is taking its signature sandwiches overseas with its first European expansion set for this year, the company said Monday. Leading the push is the brand's founder and board chair, Peter Cancro, via his company, JM Submarines UK LTD.The deal between Jersey Mike's and Cancro's entity calls for 400 stores to be opened in the U.K. and Ireland, and it will be the first in a series of plans for future international growth. The privately owned Jersey Mike's was acquired for a reported $8 billion by Blackstone in late 2024. \"All consumers, not only here in the U.S. but around the world, are looking for a great value, but they want quality. They want authenticity,\" Jersey Mike's CEO Charlie Morrison told CNBC in an interview. \"Everything about the brand screams quality and freshness, and I think that's what consumers want anywhere in the world. They're going to be picky and careful about what they choose, but we believe strongly they're going to choose Jersey Mike's over anybody else.\"Morrison noted that deli style subs are becoming a staple internationally, and he plans to stay true to the brand's roots in this expansion. He said Jersey Mike's 20 consecutive years of positive same-store sales growth in the U.S. to help inform the international move. A Jersey Mike's restaurant in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAt Wingstop, where Morrison served as CEO until 2022, the brand pushed heavily into international markets and was a pandemic winner in both stock performance and sales.\"I've learned that in my past, that consumers around the world really prefer that you bring them ... that which got the brand to where it is today,\" Morrison said.Cancro founded Jersey Mike's in 1975 after purchasing the first Mike's Subs store in Point Pleasant, N.J., He led the brand as CEO for nearly 50 years, until Morrison took over in April 2025. He said diners might see different toppings or sauces overseas than they do in the U.S., but the product will ring true to what is served in the sates.\"We see it as a great sandwich market,\" Cancro said of Europe. \"[There are] a lot of players in the marketplace, and we see a tremendous opportunity.\"The U.S. consumer is increasingly value-conscious, but Jersey Mike's believes it can still win over diners in that environment, Morrison said.\"Certainly, we've seen some challenges at the lower end across the industry, but again, at Jersey Mike's, it's a craveable product. It's one that's going to be a staple for consumers for a long time to come,\" he said.",

However, fuel and light inflation rate eased at 1.97%, lower than the 2.32% print in November.The \"lower inflation print is likely to keep the hopes of one last rate cut alive\" but given the start of a new CPI series from next month, the central bank can do a \"better assessment of inflation and rates trajectory\" from April policy, said Anubhuti Sahay, head of India Economics Research at Standard Chartered Bank.The Reserve Bank of India expects consumer inflation to be 2% for the fiscal year ending March 2026, down from a 2.6% forecast made in October.

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks to the media after a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, at her residence in Tokyo, Japan, Jan. 2, 2026. Kyodo | Via ReutersJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is planning to dissolve the country's Lower House later this month and opt for a snap election likely in February, according to public broadcaster NHK. This comes as reports over the weekend from Japanese media said that the LDP was looking to capitalize on Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's high approval ratings to stabilize the ruling coalition.NHK said Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications had instructed the election board in each prefecture to prepare for possible general elections. Takaichi's approval ratings are at a historic 75%, according to a Nikkei survey, marking the third straight month of ratings above 70%.The high ratings come at a time when Tokyo has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Beijing over comments from Takaichi in November about Chinese military action against Taiwan possibly triggering an intervention by Japan's Self-Defense Forces.The snap election, if called in February, would be just about four months into Takaichi's term as prime minister, and would be the first election that the LDP would run with its junior coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party.  Reuters on Monday reported that JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura had spoken to Takaichi, and said that the prime minister's view on the timing of the election had shifted to a \"new stage,\" without giving more details.The LDP and the JIP hold 230 seats in the Lower House, and with three independents joining, the ruling coalition now holds a slim majority in the 465-seat chamber. However, the coalition is in the minority in Japan's Upper House, holding only 119 of the 250 seats. Opposition vows change of governmentSeparately, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan leader Yoshihiko Noda vowed to oust the ruling coalition in an NHK interview, while raising expectations of an alliance with Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner. The CDP, Japan's largest opposition party, holds 148 seats in the Lower House, with Komeito controlling 24 seats. Komeito had dropped out of the ruling coalition over \"illegal political financing practices\" from the LDP as  Takaichi was running for prime minister in October 2025, ending a partnership that had been in place since 1999. Since taking office, Takaichi has had to contend with a weakening yen, above target inflation, and a weak economy.The yen is currently at its weakest level against the dollar in a year, hitting a low of 158.19 against the greenback on Monday. Inflation in Japan has ran above the Bank of Japan's target for a 44th straight month. Japan's revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed the economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "Tankers are seen at the Khor Fakkan Container Terminal, the only natural deep-sea port in the region and one of the major container ports in the Sharjah Emirate, along the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which one-fifth of global oil output passes on June 23, 2025. Giuseppe Cacace | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Strait of Hormuz is once again back in focus as a possible U.S. intervention in Iran raises the risk of Tehran disrupting one of the world's most critical energy chokepoints.U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a range of options against Iran, according to multiple media reports on Sunday, as it cracks down on domestic protests. Industry experts cautioned that a military confrontation could provoke Iran to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that that connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea and through which nearly a third of the world's seaborne crude flows.\"A disruption through the Strait of Hormuz could cause a global oil and gas crisis\" especially when considering the \"desperate and ill advised lengths the current Iranian regime may go to\" should they find themselves increasingly backed into a corner with their power and lives at stake, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Marquee. About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed. The risk of the waterway being blocked had also surfaced during the flare-up between Washington and Tehran in June last year.As Iran's production and exports are far larger than Venezuela's, the global market would inevitably feel stronger ripple effects, said Muyu Xu, senior crude analyst at Kpler, adding that Chinese refiners could be forced to seek alternatives.Unlike Venezuela, any military action involving Iran carries \"materially higher risks\" given the volume of crude and refined product supply and transit exposure, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, who sees a 70% likelihood of selective U.S. strikes on Iran.In an extreme escalation scenario, where tankers are unable to pass or energy infrastructure is damaged, oil prices could surge by double digits, said analysts.\"The fear of a closure will cause the price of oil to rise a few dollars per barrel, but it is the complete closure of the Strait that can result in a $10 to $20 per barrel spike,\" said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.Kavonic sees an \"immediate oil price spike\" in the wake of any U.S. attack on Iran, but that will soften on any sign of the disruption being temporary. Global benchmark Brent last hovered around $63 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures held at $59 per barrel.Most analysts stress that any catastrophic outcomes still remain low-probability events.While Iran can always threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz, they may not want to do so given the complexity of power dynamics in the region and may not have the capability to fully close it given how the U.S. Navy is patrolling the area, said Kpler's Xu.Even in a scenario where Iran attempts a temporary disruption, such as harassing tankers or briefly blocking transit, the physical impact on supply would be limited. Kpler estimates the oil market is currently tilting toward oversupply, with roughly 2.5 million barrels per day of excess supply in January and over 3 million barrels per day in February and March.Additionally, any closure will likely be met with a show of force by the U.S. and allies to restore flows again, Kavonic said.Still, experts cautioned against drawing direct parallels between Iran and Venezuela, where the Trump administration used sanctions, seizures to exert pressure on the Venezuelan regime, before capturing President Nicolás Maduro.It would be very difficult for the U.S. to adopt a strategy toward Iran similar to Venezuela, because Iran is far from U.S. soil and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East is a lot more complex than in Latin America, Xu said. \"Plus, Trump's priority right now appears to be consolidating U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere.\"Lipow echoed that view, saying a Venezuela-style playbook in Iran is more likely to involve sanctions and enforcement rather than military occupation or attacks on infrastructure.",

The airlines' CEOs discussed their proposed combination with Amazon beforehand, he said.The deal has an implied value of  $18.89 for each Sun Country share, a premium of almost 20% over Sun Country's closing stock price of $15.77 on Friday, Allegiant said.Allegiant shareholders would own about 67% of the combined company and Sun Country's shareholders would own around 33%, the airlines said. The deal includes $400 million of Sun Country's net debt.Sun Country and Allegiant each focus on vacationers, particularly to sun-and-beach and other leisure destinations.The deal will test the Trump administration's appetite for an airline merger. Allegiant's Anderson expressed confidence that the agreement would be approved, noting that the two carriers have little network overlap. The airlines expect the deal to close in the second half of this year.Allegiant approached Sun Country in late fall, Anderson said. If the deal is approved by regulators, Anderson would become CEO of the combined airline.

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLawmakers this week plan to revisit efforts to pass a market structure bill that will determine the crypto industry's future in the U.S. — reviving legislative efforts that stagnated last year.On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to hold hearings on their respective parts of the crypto bill, where they might revise the text. This will lay the groundwork for establishing legislative guardrails for digital assets in the U.S. — a potential watershed moment for the crypto industry. This is what you need to know about the market structure bill and efforts to pass it. The bill's objectiveThe so-called Clarity Act aims to provide legislative guardrails for the multitrillion-dollar crypto market and big digital asset firms — which could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto in the U.S. It seeks to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's and Commodities Futures Trading Commission's roles in regulating cryptocurrencies, in addition to creating more well-defined token classifications. It also aims to outline registration and compliance standards for a wide range of crypto brokerages, exchanges and other entities, enabling them to operate more easily in the U.S. Those guardrails could help the U.S. court more digital assets companies to set up shop stateside, stimulating the economy and boosting the crypto market, according to Summer Mersinger, CEO of crypto trade group Blockchain Association.\"We've seen this massive movement of companies and activity back on shore because there is a friendly administration to crypto,\" Mersinger said. But, without a market structure law, \"that could all go away, especially if there's a change to an unfriendly administration.\"That said, the bill's implications for digital asset companies, crypto holders and other investors won't be 100% clear until the draft legislation's language is finalized. What's happening this weekLawmakers will attempt to hash out three key issues this week: stablecoin-linked rewards; the treatment of decentralized finance platforms and their developers; and the matter of blocking elected officials such as President Donald Trump from profiting off of crypto ventures. Trump-affiliated entities have launched both a memecoin and nonfungible token in the past. The stablecoin issue is \"the biggest outstanding issue\" for negotiations on the Hill, said Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber.\"Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill,\" Carbone said. \"Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.\"In early January, the American Bankers Association's Community Bankers Council wrote to Senate members, asking them to prevent stablecoin issuer affiliates from offering rewards to customers. The stablecoin products, they said, exploit a loophole in the stablecoin-centric Genius Act passed last year that prohibits dollar-pegged tokens that offer yields to holders — which pose an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts and other traditional products. On the DeFi front, crypto advocates are fighting to ensure developers do not face prosecution when their technology is used for illicit activities like money laundering. \"We're very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill… but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn't some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can't comply,\" DeFi Education Fund chief legal officer Amanda Tuminelli told CNBC. DeFi advocates also want to ensure the market structure bill contains language allowing individuals to self-custody their crypto. In addition, they want provisions from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that call for software developers and blockchain service providers who do not control or custody customer funds to be exempt from registering as money-transmitting businesses. Finally, some lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) want to prevent public officials from profiting off of digital asset ventures while they serve. \" It's a really hard issue,\" Mersinger said. \"They ended up kind of punting [on] it in the House because it was really difficult to put on the bill. A lot of Senate Democrats have said, 'We're not going to punt on this issue.'\" 'Key window'The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to put out new drafts of the market structure bill, with the aim of discussing and revising details of the proposed legislation Thursday at markup, according to Mersinger. Later, they will join the two documents to create one big crypto bill. That draft will go to the Senate floor, where discussions could take several weeks, before potentially making its way through the rest of the lawmaking process to become law. Crypto proponents want to see the bill passed before the 2026 midterm elections in case some of the industry's allies are unseated in November and to avoid losing momentum on the Hill, Mersinger told CNBC. \"There's a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year, and so this is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that's needed to get it done,\" Mersinger said. ",

    "body": "LONDON, ENGLAND - JANUARY 11: People take part in a rally in solidarity with protesters in Iran on January 11, 2026 in London, England. Alishia Abodunde | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump is readying for a likely intervention in Iran, as the country cracks down on protestors, with several hundreds reportedly killed and internet access cut off.   The possible next steps could include boosting antigovernment sources online, deploying cyber weapons against the Iranian military and civilian sites, placing more sanctions on the regime as well as military strikes, The Wall Street Journal reported. Trump's aides are set to brief him on Tuesday on a possible intervention.The options being presented to Trump range from targeted strikes inside Iran to offensive cyber attacks, Politico also reported, citing an unnamed official familiar with the ongoing development. \"If the U.S. decides it needs to act to protect personnel or assets, or to protect energy flows, then it has a range of tools, from cyber and sabotage, to drones and missile strikes from air and sea,\" said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research.  The U.S. could also attack nuclear or military infrastructure or government facilities to reduce the regime's abilities and \"deter the regime from disruptive actions,\" Gertken added.  The unrest in Iran, which started in late December over soaring prices and the collapse of Iran's currency, has intensified and morphed into wider antigovernment protests that threaten the Islamic regime. Tehran has over the weekend stepped up action against protestors, with more the 500 people killed,  according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iran has warned the U.S. and Israel against any intervention, with President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday, blaming them for fueling the unrest. \"Iran is far more capable of retaliating against the U.S., especially by attacking regional energy infrastructure,\" Gertken said, adding that the Trump administration was \"not necessarily eager to destroy the regime\" unless it deteriorates \"so significantly that the U.S. finds it cannot pass up the opportunity to intervene to force a change of regime.\" Trump takes aim Trump's administration's playbook often \"changes day by day,\" but his threats still carry weight as Iran has long been on his agenda and the unrest swells into the \"deepest and most widespread protest\" in years that the regime does not have under control, Dan Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East.\"  Trump has openly backed Iranian protestors and telegraphed his interest in intervening several times on his Truth Social platform, saying that the U.S. would come to the \"rescue\" of Iranians if the authorities there continued to kill protesters. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" Trump said in a social media post Saturday. \"We're looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options,\" Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. \"We'll make a determination.\" The dilemma is at its peak: a strong strike could potentially undermine the regime's repression efforts, but at the same time it might lead to greater cohesion within the regime and a broader escalation.Danny CitrinowiczSenior Researcher, Institute for National Security StudiesTrump is also considering non-kinetic measures including cyber and covert action, according to Politico, noting the U.S. President was not expected to send American forces into the country and there has been no major movement of U.S. military assets. The U.S. is looking at restoring internet communications in Iran as its leaders have cut off internet and phone services in the country. \"We may get the internet going, if that's possible,\" Trump told reporters. \"We may speak to Elon Musk. I'm going to call him as soon as I'm finished with you.\" Iran has reportedly jammed Musk's Starlink during the latest protests. Even if the U.S. administration considers a \"symbolic\" kinetic strike, it could trigger a \"much broader escalation,\" said Danny Citrinowicz, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies.  \"The dilemma is at its peak: a strong strike could potentially undermine the regime's repression efforts, but at the same time it might lead to greater cohesion within the regime and a broader escalation,\" Citrinowicz said. \"Given the absence of leadership in the opposition, such a strike may achieve an operational success but not a strategic one,\" he added. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Iranian Parliament speaker, warned during a session broadcast live by state television that Israel and \"all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets\" if the U.S. attacks Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last Friday that Iran's government will \"not back down\" amid the protests. The unrest comes as the Islamic republic has been increasingly vulnerable with leaders facing mounting internal and domestic strains and a population growing angrier over a deepening economic crisis. Its official currency rial has lost half of its value over the past year, plunging to record-lows of about 1 million rials per U.S. dollar, according to LSEG data. \"These protests, whatever the outcome, will further damage an already fractured legitimacy for a state system that is at the end of its life,\" said Sanam Vakil, director of Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. — CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed to this story.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 9, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is weighing options to take action against Iran, according to multiple reports on Sunday.The president has been shown potential plans, ranging from possible military strikes to action that doesn't include the military, according to MS Now and other media outlets, citing U.S. officials. Trump aides are set to brief the president Tuesday on measures, including military, cyber and economic, to follow through on his threats, according to reports.  Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran in recent days, warning its leaders against using force against protestors. On Saturday, the president said the U.S. is \"ready to help.\"The White House and U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The discussion of possible intervention comes as Iran's clerical leadership is facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022. More than 500 people have been killed amid a third week of protests and an ongoing economic crisis, according to human rights agencies. Iran's government has intensified its crackdown on protestors, including a reported internet blackout.Iran has been an Islamic Republic since 1979, after the U.S.-backed Shah was deposed by Ayatollah Khomenei. His protégé, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also known as the Supreme Leader, is now in charge. With an inflation rate above 50%, Iran — a country of 92 million people — has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseTrump earlier this week threatened military intervention if Iran moves to crush the protests. Tehran warned on Sunday that it would retaliate against Israeli and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran. Some U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed skepticism about the prospect of the U.S. intervening with Iran.\"I don't think it's the job of the American government to be involved with every freedom movement around the world,\" Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week.\" Paul argued that bombing Iran risks rallying its citizens to the government's side. Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that history shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, arguing the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government triggered a series of events that eventually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the 1970s.Others were more hawkish, arguing it is in the U.S.'s best interests to act.On Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged Trump to \"embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the regime.\"\"If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people,\" he said.This story is developing.

    "body": "The Google logo displayed on a smartphone alongside a shopping cart.Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | LightRocket via Getty ImagesAs retailers increasingly turn to artificial intelligence tools to lure shoppers and run key parts of their business, Google wants to make sure it's in the center of the action. At the kickoff of the National Retail Federation's annual show on Sunday, Google announced the launch of what it's calling the Universal Commerce Protocol. The company wants UCP to become an industry standard that retailers use for their AI agents and systems across tasks like discovery, buying and \"post-purchase-support.\"Google says the open-source protocol creates a unified system spanning the shopping experience, from searching to payment, so that retailers don't have to build their own tools and connect the various functions. \"It's very important to have a standardized way so we can scale these things and everyone can be prepared for all the various steps to happen,\" Vidhya Srinivasan, vice president of Google ads and commerce, said in an interview. \"Businesses can pick and choose what they want so there's flexibility for them.\"E-commerce has emerged as one of the major battlegrounds in the booming generative AI market, with Google facing off against OpenAI, Perplexity and Amazon, as they all try and get consumers to use their various apps and services to begin their shopping journey. In September, OpenAI announced Instant Checkout, which allows users to buy some products through ChatGPT, taking a fee from transactions it helps orchestrate. OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe, is open source and could compete with UCP.Perplexity in May said it's partnering with PayPal to let users buy products, book travel and secure concert tickets directly in its chat without leaving the platform, and in November said it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users ahead of the holiday season. And earlier last year, Amazon launched \"Shop Direct,\" a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled \"Buy for Me,\" an AI agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf.By 2030, the retail market could represent a $3 trillion to $5 trillion opportunity globally due to AI-powered tools and agentic commerce, according to a report in October from McKinsey. Google said UCP was co-developed with companies including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair and Target. The protocol will soon power a new checkout feature allowing users to buy direct from Google's AI Mode or Gemini App. They can pay via Google Wallet, but Srinivasan said the company plans to include other payment methods like PayPal in the future. Srinivasan said UCP will be compatible with other existing protocols. As part of Sunday's announcements, Google also introduced a feature called Business Agent, allowing shoppers to chat with brands.\"This is to address the newer consumer behavior which is shifted toward more conversational commerce,\" Srinivasan said. \"We want retailers to be able to connect to users on our surfaces but using their own voice.\"Then there's Google's core market: advertising. Google said it's testing \"Direct Offers,\" which will let retailers promote unique discounts, such as 20% off of a product, if a user of the AI Mode chatbot expresses intent to buy something. \"Our role in the ecosystem is that of a matchmaker and one way is with ads,\" Srinivasan said. \"It's a really big focus for us to innovate in the space that adds value to both retailers and buyers.\"WATCH: Alphabet tops Apple by market capwatch now",

    "body": "A tower crane stands above residential buildings in an urban district in the afternoon light, on January 9, 2026, in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBEIJING — China's push into high-tech industries isn't large enough to offset the country's property slump, leaving the economy more exposed to trade tensions, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.From 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, the report said. The analysis drew on official Chinese data and industry-specific sources.The findings come as China seeks to boost technological self-reliance in response to U.S. restrictions. Under a five-year development plan set to kick off in earnest in March, Beijing is doubling down on advanced technologies with state investment and favorable policies.\"China's growth strategy isn't going to work,\" Logan Wright, partner at Rhodium and a co-author of the report, told CNBC. \"They're not going to achieve their targeted rates of GDP growth based on the policies they have outlined so far.\"watch nowBeijing has targeted annual GDP growth of around 5% in recent years. For China to sustain that pace, new industries would need to expand sevenfold over the next five years to generate the roughly 2 percentage points of annual investment growth required, Rhodium estimated.That translates to an additional 2.8 trillion yuan in new investment required this year — or 120% more than in 2025. While investment in artificial intelligence or robotics could increase in the next year or two, other emerging industries are unlikely to sustain such rapid growth, the analysts said.\"Electric vehicles have likely already reached their fastest rates of growth, and output in the industry may be slowing in the years ahead,\" the Rhodium report said. Property drag deepensWhile Beijing has prioritized high-tech development, it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector once accounted for more than a quarter of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels not seen since 2009, according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.Only in recent weeks have sighs appeared that some policymakers are considering more forceful property support. China's top leaders are due to formalize economic targets for the year at an annual parliamentary meeting in March.A macro outlook published by global investment firm KKR estimated that property weakness will shave 1.2 percentage points off China's GDP growth this year. Even with a projected 2.6 percentage point contribution from digital technologies, the estimated total growth was still on the low end at 4.6%. \"Despite a potential 5% growth target for 2026, headwinds from real estate and a weak job market cast doubt on achievability,\" the report said. KKR predicts the property drag could halve in 2027, but sees limited improvement in digital industries or consumer demand.From jobs to trade tensionsAn overemphasis on tech could have broader economic consequences.New industrial sectors may offer higher wages, but they employ far fewer people than traditional industries, the Rhodium analysis found. Increased factory automation, coupled with China's already high 30% share of global manufacturing output, could lead to the loss of up to 100 million jobs over the next decade — a displacement that would exceed the total workforce of most developed economies, KKR said.China's urban unemployment rate remained above 5% for much of last year, while youth unemployment has been about three times higher.Since it's unlikely that domestic investment, even in newer industries, will produce sufficient demand, \"Beijing will become even more dependent upon gaining market share in export markets,\" the Rhodium report said.\"China will remain even more reliant upon exports in the future, leaving the economy vulnerable to new trade restrictions,\" the report said.As lower-priced Chinese goods, including electric vehicles, have expanded overseas, Mexico and the European Union have joined the U.S. in raising tariffs on imports from China. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's economic imbalance mirrors a similar divergence in the U.S., where AI-linked companies have led stock market gains, while other parts of the economy have struggled.But many in Beijing argue that the country has longer-term interests at stake.Zhang Jianping, a deputy director at China's Commerce Ministry, told CNBC last week that the country's policies are designed to support innovation over multiple years. Traditional industries such as steel and real estate, he added, must integrate new technologies to remain competitive.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new position in Alphabet, making the Google parent the conglomerate's 10th largest equity holding at the end of September, according to a regulatory filing.Berkshire disclosed a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet at the end of the third quarter, a surprising move given Buffett's traditional value investing philosophy and reluctance toward high-growth, tech names. While Berkshire has owned Apple for years, Buffett has called it more of a consumer products company than a pure tech play.The purchase was also likely made by Berkshire investment managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have been more active in technology names. One of them initiated an investment in Amazon back in 2019, and Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of the e-commerce shares.Alphabet has been the market's standout winner this year with shares rallying 46%. Strong demand for artificial intelligence has driven solid momentum in Alphabet's cloud business.Buffett previously admitted that he \"blew it\" by failing to invest early in Google even though he had insight into its advertising potential. Berkshire's auto insurance unit Geico was an early customer of Google, paying the search engine 10 bucks every time someone clicked on the ad at the time.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"Trimming AppleBerkshire continued paring back its massive Apple stake, trimming the position by another 15% in the quarter to $60.7 billion.Buffett went on a head-turning selling spree in Apple in 2024, slashing two-thirds of the shares Berkshire held in a surprising move for the famously long-term-focused investor. Berkshire also cut the holding in the second quarter of this year.Even with the continuous sales, the iPhone maker remains Berkshire's biggest equity holding.The conglomerate also dialed back its Bank of America stake by 6% to a bet worth just under $30 billion. Berkshire reduced holdings in Verisign and DaVita as well in the third quarter.Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters as valuations continued to climb in the tech-driven bull market.The 95-year-old Buffett is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, with longtime lieutenant Greg Abel set to take the reins. Investors have been watching Berkshire's positioning closely for clues about the next era of leadership and how its investment approach may evolve.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

As part of the split, Curry will maintain sole ownership of Curry Brand and is free to find another retail partner. Under Armour will release the Curry 13, the final Curry Brand shoe with Under Armour, in February.\"For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround,\" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. \"And for Stephen, it's the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We'll always be grateful for what he's brought to the UA team.\" \"What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it's only growing stronger,\" Curry said in a statement. \"I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.\" Under Armour's split with Curry was announced alongside an expansion of the company's restructuring plan. The company now expects it to cost $255 million, $95 million more than it previously said, including the separation of the Curry brand, additional contract terminations, impairment charges and severance costs. Under Armour's basketball business, including the Curry brand, is expected to bring in between $100 million and $120 million in revenue during the current fiscal year, which will end early next year, the company said in a news release. The separation is not expected to have a \"significant effect\" on Under Armour's financial results or profitability, it said.watch nowUnder Armour's breakup with Curry, one of the most successful and widely known basketball players of his generation, comes at a difficult point for the brand. The company has seen a revolving door of top leadership, sales have fallen for eight straight quarters and Plank is trying to position it as a premium brand at a time when consumers aren't spending as much on new clothes and shoes.Plus, the competitive landscape has changed dramatically since Plank founded the business in 1996. These days, even industry leaders like Nike are struggling to hold on to their market share in the face of upstarts like On and Hoka, which have been wooing top athletes and winning over a new generation of customers. To reignite sales, Plank has worked to fix Under Armour's assortment and redefine the brand more clearly in a strategy he said will begin to show up on shelves, stores and social channels this fall and winter season.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Under Armour shares have fallen about 40% this year. Nike and Adidas, which both have partnerships with an array of top NBA players, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Curry's partnership with Under Armour had long been a focal point for the brand and presumably would have been a major part of its turnaround strategy. Given the state of Under Armour's business, the abrupt breakup raises questions about what may have driven the split.Over the last nine years, Curry was mentioned on just about every quarterly earnings call Under Armour held, according to a review of transcripts dating back to 2016. But in its most recent one last week, there was no reference to Curry or the partnership.The sneakers worn by Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors before the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves during Round 2 Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2025 at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Jesse D. Garrabrant | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesDuring the call, Plank talked about the brand's opportunities in football and intimated it could do more in basketball.\"You can take a category like basketball that's roughly $100 million globally for us all in. And we think to ourself it's incredible for a $5 billion company, that can't exploit that in a bigger, better way,\" said Plank. \"So being underscaled relative to the potential we have and the opportunity that we have to grow it. So we're approaching that positioning as to where do we have the right to play, the right to win, and we think we can just do a little better.\"Curry Brandwatch nowIn 2013, Curry shocked the sneaker world by signing with Under Armour over Nike. At the time, Under Armour was a much smaller brand, but Curry was drawn to the company's \"underdog mentality.\"Curry told CNBC Sport earlier this year he hoped Curry Brand will outlive his playing career and become a brand other athletes embrace — similar to Nike's Jordan Brand. The four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP is 37 and nearing the end of his basketball playing career, and he has started to focus more on golf and other business activities outside of basketball.Curry Brand launched in 2020. In 2023, the brand signed a new long-term extension and made Curry the president, housed under Under Armour's banner. As part of that deal, the 11-time NBA All-Star was given 8.8 million Under Armour common shares, valued at $75 million at the time, in addition to other awards and incentives.Under Armour will continue to develop new UA Basketball products after parting with Curry, according to a statement.\"This move lets two strong teams do what they do best,\" Plank said in the statement. \"Under Armour is focused on product innovation and performance for athletes at every level. Curry Brand gets the independence to determine its own future. That's good for Stephen and good for UA.\" — CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report",

Nasa | Getty ImagesA former Air Force intelligence officer has pleaded guilty to lying to a federal agent by falsely claiming that her estranged astronaut wife illegally accessed her bank account while aboard the International Space Station for six months, prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said Friday.The guilty plea by Summer Worden, 50, on Thursday comes more than five years after she was indicted in the space case for lying about actions by her wife, Anne McClain, a U.S. Army colonel, West Point graduate and Iraq war combat veteran, while they were in the midst of a divorce.The claim came at a time when Worden said that the couple was engaged in a custody battle over what Worden's then-6-year-old son, who had been conceived through in vitro fertilization and carried by a surrogate.Worden's trial in the case was scheduled to begin next Monday in Houston federal court.The Kansas resident was accused of making false statements about McClain to NASA's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, where she alleged that McCain had committed identity theft.Worden in July \"alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement headlined \"Far Out\" on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov.

Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "An exterior view of the new JPMorgan Chase global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue on Nov. 13, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStubHub shares plunged 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported quarterly results for the first time since its initial public offering in September.Here's how the ticket vendor did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Loss per share: $4.27Revenue: $468.1 million vs. $452 million expectedDuring a conference call with investors, StubHub CEO and founder Eric Baker said the company wouldn't provide guidance for the current quarter.Baker said that the company takes \"a long term approach,\" adding that the timing of when tickets go on sale can vary, making it hard to predict consumer demand. StubHub plans to offer outlook for 2026 when it reports fourth-quarter results, he said.\"The demand for live events is phenomenal,\" Baker said. \"We don't see anything with consumer demand that's any different.\"Revenue increased 8% in its third quarter from $433.8 million a year earlier, the company said.StubHub reported a net loss of $1.33 billion, or a loss of $4.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or a loss of 15 cents per share, during the same period last year. StubHub said this reflects a one-time stock-based compensation charge of $1.4 billion stemming from its IPO.Gross merchandise sales, which represent the total dollar value paid by ticket buyers, rose 11% year over year to $2.43 billion.The company faced tough comparisons from a year earlier, when results were boosted by Taylor Swift's massively popular Eras Tour. Excluding that impact, StubHub said GMS grew 24% year over year.Founded in 2000, StubHub primarily generates revenue from connecting buyers with ticket resellers. It competes with Vivid Seats, which was taken public via a special purpose acquisition company in 2021; SeatGeek; and Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment.\"We are building a truly differentiated consumer product that improves the experience for fans while unlocking better economics for venues, teams, and artists through open distribution,\" Baker said in a statement. \"We're early in that journey, but our progress so far gives us great confidence in our strategy and the long-term value we're creating.\"StubHub raised $800 million in its long-awaited IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, which came after it delayed its debut twice. The most recent stall came in April after President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs roiled markets. The company restarted the process to go public in August when it filed an updated prospectus.On Thursday, the company's stock closed at $18.82. Shares are now down roughly 20% from the IPO price of $23.50.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

    "body": "watch nowBillionaire investor Ron Baron isn't flinching during the latest tech selloff, and he's certainly not touching his own Tesla shares, he said.The longtime growth investor said he sees the pullback as a chance to spot bargains, even as volatility has rattled the biggest names in tech recently.\"Not very much,\" Baron said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" when asked what he's doing amid the drawdown. \"Just looking and trying to understand where opportunities are and try to take advantage of them.\"His conviction is especially intense when it comes to Tesla, one of his signature bets. He recalled selling a third of Baron Funds' Tesla holding a few years ago due to criticism from his clients and the media about the significant concentration in a single stock. Baron emphasized that his personal position remains entirely intact.\"We sold 30% for clients. I did not sell personally a single share,\" he said.Roughly 40% of his personal net worth is invested in the electric-vehicle maker, alongside 25% in SpaceX and about 35% in Baron mutual funds.Tesla shares are down 18% from their 52-week high and were on track to open 5% lower on Friday as investors this week rethink the AI-related shares that have led the bull market.Baron said he's already made about $8 billion from Tesla over the years, and he believes he could make five times that over the next decade.Baron recounted a promise he made to the board of his mutual funds when he sought approval decades ago to invest in public stocks, a pledge that effectively binds him to Tesla and SpaceX for life.\"I told the board, 'If you let me invest a certain amount of money, then I will promise that I won't sell any of my stock. I will be the last person out of the stock,'\" he said. \"I will not sell a single share of my shares until my clients sold 100% of their shares. ... And I don't expect to sell in my lifetime Tesla or SpaceX.\"",

    "body": "Representation of Bitcoin cryptocurrency in this illustration taken Sept. 10, 2025. Dado Ruvic | ReutersBitcoin dipped below $95,000 on Friday, pushing the world's oldest cryptocurrency further into the red and continuing its four-day decline amid a broader artificial intelligence-linked stock pullback.The digital asset hit $94,491.22 early Friday, marking its lowest level since May 7. Bitcoin is down nearly 9% week to date, despite briefly reclaiming $107,000 at one point on Tuesday and then rolling over.The token was last trading at $97,163.99, or 1% lower on the day, as it regained some of its morning losses.The largest crypto by market capitalization attracts many of the same investors that have poured funds into BigTech stocks, linking the two trades. Several of those stocks are falling this week amid a resurfacing of concerns over Silicon Valley giants' astronomical spending on AI initiatives.\"There's less money in the system,\" Yat Siu, co-founder of crypto investment and blockchain development firm Animoca Brands told CNBC. That leads to investors \"selling certain things off in order to basically deal with other shortfalls or concerns that they might have because there's a retraction broadly.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 5 daysThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.6% on Friday, with Meta, Alphabet, Intel, Nvidia and Tesla shedding between roughly 1% and 2%.Crypto-linked stocks also fell Friday. Software firm and bitcoin treasury Strategy, formerly Microstrategy, dipped 6%. Trading platforms Gemini Space Station and Bullish's stocks shed 2%, while Coinbase shares edged down 1%. Digital asset mining firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies was also trading 3% lower.Siu noted that this crypto market cycle could differ from past ones, particularly due to the relatively recent influx of institutional capital into digital assets. Institutions don't typically follow major, long-time bitcoin holders' almost \"religious\" belief in the token's four-year price cycle, he said. That could help bitcoin and other digital assets remain somewhat resilient to recent and soon-to-come headwinds.\"People think bitcoin is going to go down to $60,000 because of the four year cycle [and the token's history of] drops and corrections,\" Siu said. \"But, I don't believe that because the institutions are not going to follow that particular cycle. They'll look at [the market downturn] as more as a buying opportunity.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Friday that she had appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.Because of that, he wrote, \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,.\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote \"Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"Bondi, the attorney general, in a post on X, wrote, \"Thank you, Mr. President.\"\"SDNY U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton is one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country, and I've asked him to take the lead,\" Bondi wrote. \"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\"\"Trump should release all of the Epstein files: every person and every document in the files,\" Hoffman posted late on X on Friday. I want this complete release because it will bring justice for the victims.\"\"I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander. I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT,\" his post continued on X. \"The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein.\"\"I will do everything in my power going forward to advocate for the release of the files, to get justice for Epstein's victims, and to promote the values of truth our great country was founded on,\" Hoffman said. \"I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.\"Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, \"The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks.\"\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesEmails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\"Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.watch nowTrump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by thatIn another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added.",

    "body": "Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhen incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when was Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

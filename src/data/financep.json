    "body": "An exhibition room at Pop Mart's theme park, Pop Land, in Beijing, on June 18, 2025.Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart fell 9% Thursday, notching the stock's worst day since April and extending its declines since a late-August peak.The company behind the popular Labubu dolls, a series of collectible elf-like monster dolls that come in blind-box packaging, reported on Tuesday that third-quarter revenue had more than tripled year over year as sales in the U.S. swelled between 1,265% and 1,270%.And yet concerns are growing the craze could be fading.Data from Chinese resale platform Qiandao shows that some Labubus are being sold close to or below official Pop Mart retail prices, a stark shift after a period of sky-high demand and prices. The Labubu character Luck, released in April, for example, saw its resale price soar to over 500 yuan, or about $70, at one point. But that's since dropped to 108 yuan, or about $15, according to Qiandao.Since August, Pop Mart stock has fallen 30%, but is still up 159% so far this year.Analysts are split on how to interpret the downturn.One line of thinking is that the falling resale prices could signal slowing enthusiasm for Labubu and other collectibles after a summer peak, particularly among younger, nontraditional toy buyers. Another possibility: The decline may reflect Pop Mart's efforts to increase supply and curb scalping, rather than waning consumer demand.Pop Mart reported a 10-fold increase in the supply of plush toys this year and said it now manufactures approximately 30 million units each month, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley analysts noted in a September client note that \"prices in the second-hand market do not effectively reflect the true supply and demand situation,\" especially given Pop Mart's initiatives to limit resellers' influence.The popularity of the Labubu dolls have been boosted by celebrity fans including singer Rihanna and former soccer star David Beckham. However, Labubus aren't the only Pop Mart product drawing the eye of nontraditional toy buyers.Morgan Stanley analysts noted that emerging characters like Twinkle Twinkle and opportunities for global expansion continue to play a key role in driving Pop Mart's growth.",

    "body": "A Ford logo on a Ford F-150 pickup truck for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S. Oct. 20, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT – Ford Motor beat Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but lowered its 2025 guidance due to impacts of a supplier fire, which is disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs.The Detroit automaker said the fire last month at a New York plant for aluminum supplier Novelis is expected to cost it between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, but it expects to mitigate much of that this year and next by increasing manufacturing of the impacted vehicles once supplies are more available.Ford stock fell about 4% in extended trading Thursday. The stock is up 24% so far this year, as of Thursday's close.Ford said the total cost of the fire on its business is expected to be less than $1 billion by next year, as the company announced plans Thursday to \"significantly increase\" its U.S. pickup truck production. That includes adding 1,000 workers to plants that produce the vehicles in Michigan and Kentucky in 2026. The automaker expects the additional production to recoup 50,000 units of truck production in 2026.\"We are working intensively with Novelis and others to source aluminum that can be processed in the cold rolling section of the plant that remains operational while also working to restore overall plant production. We have made substantial progress in a short time to minimize the impact in 2025 and recover production in 2026,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.Ford Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra said the fire occurred in one of three main parts of the plant — a hot mill — with the non-impacted areas continuing to supply parts to the automaker. The impacted part of the plant is expected to restart in late November or early December, Galhotra said.Ford's new 2025 guidance now includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, down from $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion as of July; adjusted free cash flow of $2 billion to $3 billion, down from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and capital spending of roughly $9 billion, which remains the same.Ford CFO Sherry House said without the supplier fire, the company was planning to raise its 2025 guidance to more than $8 billion in adjusted EBIT rather than cutting it.Here's what Wall Street expects, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 45 cents adjusted vs. 36 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $47.19 billion vs. $43.08 billion expectedFord said there was no material impact to third-quarter results due to the fire, but that it will impact its fourth-quarter results.The automaker got a boost as it said it expects a smaller tariff impact following changes Friday by the Trump administration that included extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.Ford lowered its expected tariff costs by $1 billion, to roughly $2 billion, half of which the automaker expects to offset through other actions.The company's third-quarter revenue, including its financial arm, was $50.5 billion, a quarterly record and 9% increase from the same time a year ago. Its net income during the quarter was $2.4 billion, up from $900 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were level at $2.6 billion. Both included adverse net tariff-related impact of $700 million during the third quarter.Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. \"Our performance in the quarter show that the Ford+ plan is delivering consistent improvement. Our underlying business becomes stronger, more efficient, more agile and increasingly durable,\" House told media Thursday.The Ford+ plan is a turnaround and cost-improvement plan under Farley, who started leading the automaker more than five years ago. The company said it remains on track to cut $1 billion in costs this year as part of the plan.This is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",

    "body": "An 'Open House' sign is posted near a single family home for sale on Aug. 22, 2025 in Pasadena, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes rose 1.5% in September from August to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.06 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is slightly less than the analysts were forecasting, but the highest pace in seven months.Sales were 4.1% higher compared with September of last year.Regionally, on an annual basis, sales were strongest in the South and Northeast. From August, sales were strongest in the West and actually fell slightly in the Midwest, the only region to see a monthly decline.This count is based on closings, so people signing contracts likely in July and August, when mortgage rates were coming down but were not as low as they are now. The average rate on the 30-year fixed started July at 6.67% and is now at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"As anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Improving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.\"Inventory continued to make gains, up 14% from a year ago to 1.55 million units for sale at the end of September. That is still lean historically. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.6-month supply of homes for sale. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Inventory is matching a five-year high, though it remains below pre-Covid levels,\" Yun added. \"Many homeowners are financially comfortable, resulting in very few distressed properties and forced sales. Home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country, further contributing to overall household wealth.\" Still tight supply continues to pressure prices. The median price of a home sold in September was $415,200, up 2.1% year over year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. Prices are 53% higher than pre-Covid levels.Sales continue to see the biggest gains on the high end of the market, likely because of more supply in those tiers. Sales of home priced above $1 million rose 20% from the year before, while sales of homes priced below $100,000 were up just under 3%.First-time homebuyers are making some gains, likely due to falling mortgage rates. They made up 30% of September sales, up from 26% the year before.About 30% of sales were made all in cash. Homes are sitting on the market longer, an average 33 days, up from 28 a year ago.",

    "body": "Jasondoiy | E+ | Getty ImagesAmid recession fears, a government shutdown and tariff uncertainty, consumers are increasingly diverging in their spending.Wealthier Americans are engaging their purchasing power, while lower-income Americans are starting to pull back — commonly described as a \"K-shaped\" economy. Friday's consumer price index report could shed more light on the pressures facing large swaths of the country.The CPI report, which measures price changes across a range of goods and services, was delayed due to the government shutdown, originally scheduled to be released nine days prior. Though the report will not include any data related to the shutdown, it will offer a read on the state of inflation ahead of a Nov. 1 deadline for the Social Security Administration to calculate annual cost-of-living adjustments.Lower- and middle-income consumers have been hit hardest by rising costs on daily essentials like groceries and gas. Meanwhile, wealthier investors have benefited from stock market rallies and rising home values. Recent data from JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey found that income bracket was a large factor in Americans' varying views of the current state of the economy.Here's where bifurcation is beginning to take hold:Food and beverageCoca-Cola, often viewed as a bellwether for the financial health of consumer, has been seeing the divergence across its business.Pricier products that are more exposed to high-income consumers, like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes, are fueling the company's sales growth, CEO James Quincey told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday. At the same time, Coke is seeing higher demand at both dollar stores that cater to low-income consumers looking for deals and higher-end outlets that skew toward wealthier consumers, like fast-casual restaurants and amusement parks.McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in early September that the burger chain's expansion of its value menu was in response to a divided consumer landscape, or what he called a \"two-tier economy.\"While Kempczinski said the company is seeing upper-income consumers performing well, its lower- and middle-income diners are \"a different story.\"\"Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits, and it's because people are either choosing to skip a meal... or they're choosing to just eat at home,\" he said last month.A similar dynamic is playing out at Chipotle, according to Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer.\"There are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now. That's something that we'll have to take into consideration when looking at price going forward,\" Rymer told Reuters in July.Autos and airfareLast month, the average price for a new vehicle surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book.The record pricing comes as auto loan defaults and repossessions are on the rise, particularly for those with FICO scores below 620.\"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,\" said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating in a statement last week.And though airlines have been piloting premium offerings for years, the higher-cost tickets have gained momentum in recent months.Delta Air Lines said earlier this month that revenue from its premium offerings is expected to surpass the coach cabin next year, with CEO Ed Bastian saying he's not seeing any signs of slowdown in the roomier, more expensive seats.HospitalityStill, though there are signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy, some argue it's not here to stay.Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told CNBC last month that he's seeing a bifurcation, but he doesn't expect that pattern to last much longer, partly because he sees inflation and interest rates decreasing.\"My own belief is that as we look into the fourth quarter and particularly into next year, we're going to see a very big shift in those dynamics, meaning, I don't think you're going to continue to have this bifurcation,\" Nassetta said. \"That's not to say I think the high end is going to get worse or bad, I just think the middle and the low end is going to move up.\"On Wednesday, the hotel chain reported a drop in revenue for affordable brands like Hampton by Hilton and Homewood Suites by Hilton.Meanwhile, Nassetta told investors on an earnings call that revenue from luxury offerings performed exceedingly well and remains a focus for Hilton moving forward.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas, Michael Wayland, Alex Harring, Luke Fountain and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowStarbucks Workers United is kicking off a strike authorization vote Friday, as the union representing baristas makes a bid to secure a contract with the coffee giant.The union also said it is planning a wave of rallies and pickets across the country with its baristas and allies.Voting on authorizing a strike at unionized cafes will be open for several days. If approved, the strike itself would be open-ended, with specifics to be determined. As the voting occurs, seventy rallies and pickets will take place from Friday through Nov. 1 across 60 cities, the union said. If the union votes to go on strike, this would be the third national strike to take place since last December.The two sides are not in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart in December of 2024. In February, the two parties entered into mediation, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April.Workers United says it is pushing to secure a contract that addresses three key issues. The union is demanding \"better hours to improve staffing,\" higher take-home pay (though it did not specify a wage number) and \"resolution for hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practice charges.\" Workers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, now represents over 12,000 workers across more than 650 stores. The number of unionized stores is still small, as Starbucks has over 18,000 locations in North America, both company-operated and licensed.\"We're going to do whatever it takes to secure this contract,\" Jasmine Leli, a barista at a unionized store in Buffalo, N.Y., who has been involved in regional and national bargaining, told CNBC in an interview. The union, which held a national wave of pickets in 35 cities in September and October, claims it would cost the company less than one average days' sales to settle the contract.Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement that \"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table. If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks already offers the best job in retail, she added. \"Hourly partners earn more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits and we're investing over $500 million to put more partners in stores during busy times.\"\"The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year,\" Anderson said.watch nowStarbucks is set to report earnings for the fourth quarter on Wednesday. The stock is down 6% year-to-date, and same-store sales have fallen for six straight quarters.The company is in the midst of a turnaround plan under new CEO Brian Niccol, dubbed \"Back to Starbucks.\" As part of the strategy, the company announced the rollout of its Green Apron Service plans, which rely on warm and engaging interactions between baristas and customers in the hopes of making Starbucks visits a habit.The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders, which now make up more than 30% of sales, and feedback from baristas, the company has said.The Green Apron Service push is the largest investment the company has ever made in hospitality and its store employees, Starbucks has said. On the company's third-quarter earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said Starbucks will invest more than $500 million in labor hours across company-owned cafes in the next year, starting with the Green Apron Service rollout. Starbucks also began a pilot program in late September for its assistant store manager position. It now has 62 assistant store managers in newly-created leadership roles across six regions. The company says 90% of these hires are internal promotions.Staffing has been an ongoing issue for baristas who have organized. Niccol has faced somewhat less scrutiny from the union than his predecessors have, namely former CEO Howard Schultz, who took a more combative approach.watch nowIn September, the company announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that involves closing some 500 of its North American stores, according to analyst estimates, and laying off 900 workers in non-retail roles. The union says it secured additional benefits for workers through effects bargaining at the 59 unionized stores that are closing as a result of the restructuring, including severance even if they turn down a transfer offer and extended health benefits.At the time of the restructuring, Starbucks said in a statement that \"given the industry-leading offer provided to impacted partners — including reassignment opportunities, where possible and generous severance — we were able to quickly reach and agreement with Workers United to similarly help represented partners through this transition. This reflects our commitment to partner care.\"The company added that it reached out to Workers United to work on a framework for how the changes would impact baristas in union cafes.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesTesla's forthcoming artificial intelligence chip that it's calling the AI5 will be manufactured by Samsung in Texas as well as by TSMC in Arizona, CEO Elon Musk told investors on Wednesday.On the electric vehicle maker's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla is shooting for \"excess production,\" and that any chips not used in cars or robots can be used in his company's data centers.\"Our explicit goal is to have an oversupply of AI5 chips,\" Musk said.Tesla formerly used Nvidia's Drive chips in its vehicles, but dropped them in favor of its own processors in 2019. Musk said that Tesla will continue to use Nvidia's graphics processing units, which dominate the AI market, for training its models.\"We're not about to replace Nvidia, to be clear, but we do use both in combination,\" Musk said. Tesla announced on Wednesday that it has computing capacity equivalent to 81,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips.Musk's comments offer a fresh glimpse into Tesla's AI chip strategy after ex-Apple engineer Peter Bannon left the company earlier this year. Bannon previously helmed chip design for Tesla and was leading the development of Dojo, a supercomputer meant to help the company improve its driverless technology. The AI5 chip was first announced in 2024 at Tesla's shareholder meeting. It's the latest version of the car company's Autopilot hardware that processes signals needed for self-driving features. In July, Samsung announced that it had secured a $16.5 billion chip contract with an unnamed client — Musk later confirmed it was Tesla.Musk said at the time that the AI5 chip would be made by TSMC and that its successor, the AI6 chip, would be made by Samsung. On Wednesday, he said the AI5 chip would be made by both foundries at their U.S. facilities. He said it would fit on a \"half reticle,\" meaning the chip is half the size of \"full reticle\" AI chip designs from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, holds a motherboard as he speaks during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersHyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all investing in their own AI chips in order to offer an alternative to Nvidia, and because some AI experts say custom chips may be more cost-efficient or faster for certain tasks.Aside from Tesla, only Apple currently designs its own silicon and uses it both in its products and in data centers for AI services.Musk said that because Tesla is the only client for the AI5, its chip designers were able to focus on the company's needs and to eliminate older parts of the chip that slowed it down.\"Tesla only has to satisfy requirements from one customer,\" Musk said. \"That that makes the design job radically easier and means we can delete a lot of complexity from the chip.\"He said Tesla's design team had removed the chip's legacy GPUs, signal processors and other parts, and predicted that the chip could have the best performance per dollar for AI \"maybe by a factor of 10.\"\"Nvidia has done an amazing job of dealing with almost an impossibly difficult set of requirements,\" he said. \"But in our case, we are waiting for radical simplicity.\"Musk's AI startup, xAI, which does business with Tesla, has become a major Nvidia customer. The company is currently building a massive supercomputing facility in Memphis, Tennessee, its second in the area, based around high-end Nvidia Grace Blackwell chips.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.WATCH: Tesla stock traded lower after Musk didn't mention robotaxi fleetwatch now",

    "body": "A Rivian R1S electric vehicle (EV) at a dealership and service center in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Rivian Automotive reportedly plans to lay off more than 600 people as the all-electric vehicle maker faces growing market challenges.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plans, said the layoffs will affect roughly 4% of the company's workers. Rivian had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year.A source familiar with the plans confirmed the layoffs to CNBC and said additional details are set to be shared with employees Thursday. The person spoke anonymously because the news had not yet been made public.Rivian and other EV manufacturers are increasingly facing a more challenging market than they did in recent years amid changing regulations under the Trump administration, including the elimination of a $7,500 federal incentive for purchasing an EV.Aside from regulatory issues, Rivian also faces slower-than-expected EV demand and a lack of new products until next year amid needs for cash and earnings losses. The company lost $1.1 billion during the second quarter.Rivian's vehicle sales increased 32% to 13,201 units year over year during the third quarter as buyers hurried to purchase an EV before the federal incentives expired at the end of September, but the company's 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed from as many as 46,000 units to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles.In August, Rivian also flagged a bigger adjusted core loss this year, expecting it to between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast.Shares of Rivian were level during trading Thursday afternoon. The stock is off roughly 3% this year.",

    "body": "Elon Musk listens as reporters ask U.S. President Donald Trump and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa questions during a press availability in the Oval Office at the White House on May 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThere was a lot missing from Tesla's third-quarter earnings call.CEO Elon Musk said nothing about demand for the company's electric vehicles after a key federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of the Cybertruck or the impact of tariffs on auto parts. Investors got no sign for how the fourth quarter is shaping up. That all helps explain why the stock sank almost 4% in extended trading. Rather than focus on sales, margins and earnings (which missed estimates), Musk took a familiar path, making bold promises and laying out his futuristic vision for the business. It starts with robotaxis, and Musk's view that skeptical investors and much of the public fail to see what's coming. \"People just don't don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off — where it's honestly — it's going to be like a shock wave,\" Musk said in his opening remarks. \"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we're making a couple million a year.\"Musk has for years promised that Tesla's EVs will be able to do work for their owners, making them money while they sleep by ferrying passengers or goods around without a driver. But while Alphabet's Waymo is aggressively entering new markets with its commercial robotaxi service, and Baidu's Apollo Go is taking off in China and elsewhere, Tesla is still limited to a few pilot projects. During Tesla's prior earnings call in July, Musk predicted that the company would have autonomous ride hailing available to \"probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.\"  The company still doesn't produce or sell cars that are safe to use without a human ready to steer or brake at all times.watch nowOn Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would have its robotaxi service operating without human drivers in Austin by the end of the year and that it would be running in eight to 10 cities by the close of 2025, at least with drivers on board.As for its current fleet of cars, finance chief Vaibhav Taneja said on the call that the customer base for FSD Supervised, Tesla's partially automated driving system, \"is still small,\" with 12% of users paying for the system. Taneja didn't offer an average sale price that subscribers are paying after Tesla ran a number of promotions to drive uptake. Tesla said in its investor deck that FSD revenue was lower than in the year-ago period, when the figure was $326 million. That means FSD accounted for less than 2% of total revenue in the latest quarter. After robotaxis, Musk turned to humanoid robots, repeating his prediction that Optimus has the \"potential to be the biggest product of all time.\"Optimus is Tesla's bipedal humanoid robot that's in development but not yet commercially deployed. Musk has previously said the robots will be so sophisticated that they can serve as factory workers or babysitters. Now he's raising the bar. \"Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,\" Musk said on Wednesday. He said that with Optimus and self driving, \"you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.\"Musk said Tesla will likely demo a new version of Optimus, which he called V3, in the first quarter of 2026.At the end of the call, Musk kept the focus on robots but combined it with another topic of importance: his pay package. A Tesla Optimus robot scoops popcorn and waves at attendees during the opening of the Tesla Diner and drive-in restaurant and supercharger on Santa Monica Blvd. in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles on July 21, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesIn September, Tesla introduced a new pay plan that could be worth $1 trillion and increase Musk's stake in the company by 12%. Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting in early November, when the plan will be up for a vote.\"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\" Musk said on the call. \"I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.\"He also took aim at proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after the firms recommended shareholders vote against approving his new pay plan.Musk said ISS and Glass Lewis \"have no freaking clue,\" and described them as \"corporate terrorists.\"Representatives from the two firms didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In the meantime, Tesla still relies on auto sales for the vast majority of its revenue. And while revenue increased 12% in the third quarter from a year earlier, that followed two straight year-over-year declines, and analysts expect a drop of about 2% in the fourth quarter. Absent from the call was any discussion of what Tesla may be doing in the near term to restore consumer enthusiasm.Tesla's brand ranking declined to the 25th spot on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list out earlier this month, from 12th in 2024. The report said that \"Tesla was once the main disruptive force in the automotive industry,\" but Musk's political activities along with a lack of new products \"has led to concerns about Tesla's ability to sustain high margins.\"Through Tesla's online forum, investors submitted questions about new products in the pipeline. But on the call, investor relations lead Travis Axelrod twice refused to read them. \"This is not the appropriate venue to cover that,\" he said.

It just, it didn't feel right to meet. It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we'll do it in the future,\" Trump said Wednesday.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere,\" Trump added, flanked by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, with whom he had discussed peace proposals for Ukraine.watch nowAsked why he had chosen to impose a package of sanctions on oil majors Lukoil and Rosneft at that moment, Trump said, \"I just felt it was time, we've waited a long time.\"Stony silenceTrump's comments on Putin were notably widely absent from pro-Kremlin state media outlets such as TASS, Radio Sputnik and RIA Novosti's news coverage on Thursday, with barely a mention of the criticism or canceled meeting.Just a day before, Russian state media — essentially, the mouthpiece of the Kremlin — had been bullish that planned talks between Putin and Trump that were due to be held in Hungary, but which had been postponed by the White House, would go ahead.The Kremlin and various senior Russian officials had blamed \"fake news\" for undermining the Trump-Putin summit but the White House appeared to have put the talks on hold after Russia reiterated its position that it did not support an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attends a meeting of Russia's President Vladimir Putin with Laos' President Thongloun Sisoulith in Moscow, Russia, May 9, 2024. Alexei Maishev | Via ReutersPutin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has not yet publicly commented on the canceled meeting, the sanctions, or the prospect of Trump-Putin talks being held in future. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for comment.Read moreRussia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday that that the ministry was ready to \"continue contacts\" with the U.S. State Department but said its goals in Ukraine \"remain unchanged,\" in comments translated by NBC News. The latest sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil were counterproductive, she added, to finding a peaceful solution to the war.Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a well-known anti-West hawk, slammed Trump's cancellation of the Budapest summit, commenting on Telegram Thursday that the \"U.S. is our adversary and their talkative 'peacekeeper' [Trump] has now fully embarked on the warpath against Russia.\"\"Now Trump has fully aligned himself with an insane Europe,\" Medvedev posted, in comments translated by Google.Sanctions pressureThe sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, and dozens of subsidiaries, are aimed at pressuring Moscow, which has funded its three and a half year war in Ukraine using revenues derived from global oil sales, to agree to a ceasefire, the U.S. Treasury said.The Treasury Department said the new sanctions will harm the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue to fund its war against Ukraine.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his department \"is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump's effort to end yet another war,\" Bessent said. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"watch nowThe EU on Thursday also launched a fresh rounds of sanctions against Russia. The package of measures, which member states approved on Wednesday evening, includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.Kaja Kallas, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC Thursday that the new sanctions are \"a good signal of strength that the U.S. is putting sanctions on big Russian oil companies.

Fallon | AFP | Getty Images\"This is the insider trading saga for the NBA.\"That was FBI Director Kash Patel's message at a news conference Thursday, announcing the arrests of Portland Trailblazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier.The two were among more than 30 people charged in an illegal poker ring involving organized crime and cheating, according to prosecutors. The U.S. Attorney, FBI and other law enforcement agencies are also charging Rozier as well as former Cleveland Cavaliers player and assistant coach Damon Jones with a sports betting scheme to throw games or make illegal wagers on inside information.It's the kind of news that could prove damaging to the legal gambling industry — or, perhaps, a real opportunity.Legal licensed sportsbooks in the U.S. have enjoyed massive growth in recent years, but they're still trying to expand. The market leaders FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM and Caesars don't have access to the two most populous states, California and Texas, because they have not legalized sports gambling.When state lawmakers debate the pros and cons of legalizing sports betting, there are persistent questions about sports integrity and the opportunities for cheating. Players arrested on federal charges, accused of manipulating game play and profiting on illegal activity provide solid evidence for a sermon against the dangers of gambling.The commercial gambling industry knows it. And it's seizing the moment to reiterate its protections.\"Today's events are deeply disturbing, and should concern fans, athletes, and everyone who loves sports and values integrity and fair play,\" FanDuel, owned by Flutter, said in a statement to CNBC shortly after federal prosecutors and law enforcement wrapped up their news conference.\"We are unwavering in our commitment to rooting out abuses by those who seek to undermine fair competition and the games we love,\" FanDuel said.The American Gaming Association blasted out its statement: \"Today's revelations are a stark reminder of the pervasive and predatory illegal market, ensnaring countless individuals and operating in the shadows ... It is important to recognize that the regulated legal market delivers transparency, oversight, and collaboration with authorities that assists in bringing these bad actors to light.\"A DraftKings spokesman told CNBC, \"We fundamentally believe that regulated online sports betting is the best way forward, to monitor for and detect suspicious behavior.\"Sportsbooks and the integrity monitoring companies that work with them were involved in alerting authorities to unusually large wagers on Jontay Porter prop bets that resulted in Porter being banned for life from the NBA last year and convicted on federal charges.Prosecutors say Porter's activity was part of the same conspiracy ring operating between 2022 and 2024 that resulted in six arrests this week.A rapid response from the sportsbooks with carefully crafted crisis communications messages could be designed to ward off threats from state gaming regulators to crack down on player props, which are often the basis of parlay bets.Parlays, which combine several bet criteria into a single wager, are very profitable for the sportsbooks and popular with customers, even though there are lower chances of winning.The negative headlines over illegal gambling could ultimately prove to be an opportunity in the long run for commercial and tribal casinos if it prompts more enforcement action against unlicensed operators.After all, unlicensed gambling in the U.S. is estimated to bring in $674 billion in wagers annually, the AGA said in August.",

    "body": "Work continues on a largely demolished part of the East Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, before construction of a new ballroom.Jacquelyn Martin | APThe demolition of the White House East Wing is nearly complete as President Donald Trump pushes ahead with plans to build a massive ballroom, an administration official told NBC News Thursday.Construction crews are now turning their attention to debris removal, the official said. Photos showed the building largely reduced to rubble.Trump said Wednesday that the 90,000 square foot ballroom will cost $300 million, higher than the original estimated price tag of $200 million. The White House has dimissed public anger over the demolition as \"manufactured outrage.\" The Treasury Department, which has a clear view of the demolition, banned its staff from sharing photos. Trump promised in July that the ballroom would not impact the East Wing.\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said at the time. When asked about the demolition on Wednesday, Trump said the East Wing was \"very small\" and \"never thought of as being much.\" \"In order to do it properly we had to take down the exising structure,\" the president told reporters.  Construction workers, bottom right, atop the U.S. Treasury, watch as work continues on a largely demolished part of the East Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington, before construction of a new ballroom. Jacquelyn Martin | APA senior White House official cited \"structural reasons\" for the decision to knock down East Wing when asked by CNBC on Wednesday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the administration was not required to submit plans to the National Capital Planning Commission for the demolition. \"Their general counsel has said when it comes to phase one of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that, only for vertical construction,\" Leavitt told reporters.

Trump has said the construction will be financed with his own funds and by private corporate donors at no cost to the taxpayer. Donors include tech giants Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta. The White House has released a list of corporate and individual donors: Altria Group Inc.AmazonAppleBooz Allen Hamilton Inc.Caterpillar Inc.CoinbaseComcast CorporationJ.

    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, former chief executive officer of Binance, arrives at federal court in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange, the White House said Thursday.The pardon of Zhao, widely known as CZ, came two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family's own crypto venture, which has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, has been helped by \"a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.\"\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,\" Leavitt said.Trump's pardon of Zhao came nearly a week after he commuted the 87-month prison sentence of former New York Rep. George Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\"Deeply grateful for today's pardon and to President Trump for upholding America's commitment to fairness, innovation, and justice,\" Zhao wrote in a post on X.\"Will do everything we can to help make America the Capital of Crypto and advance web3 worldwide,\" he wrote, before adding, \"still in flight, more posts to come.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., blasted the pardon, calling it an example of \"corruption.\"\"First, Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge,\" said Warren, who is the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.\"Then he boosted one of Donald Trump's crypto ventures and lobbied for a pardon,\" she said.\"Today, Donald Trump did his part and pardoned him. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption in pending market structure legislation, it owns this lawlessness.\"Zhao, in November 2023, pleaded guilty in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.Zhao had been charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully violating U.S. economic sanction in an intentional effort to profit from the American market without implementing legally required controls, the DOJ said.Binance had been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and conspiracy.He was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail.Federal prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence Zhao to three years in prison.Leavitt noted that request in her statement on Thursday about Zhao's pardon.\"The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career,\" Leavitt said.\"These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation,\" she said. \"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over.\"Correction: Binance had been charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. An earlier version misstated the name of the act. ",

    "body": "In September, The Economist released its third annual \"Carrie Bradshaw index,\" named after the protagonist of the hit TV show \"Sex and the City.\" The report ranks the U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live alone.The index was named after the character because, on the show, she lives in a studio apartment in the West Village and it is highly unlikely that she could afford it on a writer's salary now, Lizzy Peet, a data researcher at The Economist, tells CNBC Make It.\"It all came about from a sort of snappy way to sum up the aspiration, a sort of quality of living by yourself in a big city for the first time. How much would you have to earn to afford that? And how much is that a realist prospect?\" she says.To rank the U.S. cities, The Economist used the rule that a tenant should spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. That, in combination with using rental prices from Zumper, led to the calculation of the salary needed to afford a typical studio in each city. Each city was given a \"Bradshaw score\" where a value more than one means an average studio apartment is affordable and less than one means housing is unaffordable.\"Cities that build a lot or maybe that have less demand or maybe have less population demand on rent are the kind of cities that are looking more affordable,\" Peet says.One big change in this year's index is that some cities that were affordable last year have slid into the unaffordable category this year, Peet adds.A lot of cities in Texas, like Dallas, Houston, and Austin, moved from what was deemed affordable to what is now deemed unaffordable.\"There are loads of factors at work here. It's important to know that rental markets can be quite random, but they can fluctuate a lot in a very short space of time,\" Peet says. \"It's pretty well documented that Texas has seen this influx of middle-class workers, and that would drive rent up.\"In this year's index, 41 cities were unaffordable, up from 38 cities last year.Wichita, KansasCweimer4 | E+ | Getty Images10 U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live aloneWichita, Kan.Baton Rouge, La.Lincoln, Neb.Des Moines, IowaAkron, OhioTucson, Ariz.Tulsa, Okla.St. Louis, Mo.Albuquerque, N.M.Aurora, Colo.Wichita, Kansas, is the most affordable city in the index. It has a Bradshaw score of around 1.75, which means that median wages in the city are 75% higher than needed to afford an average studio apartment.The average monthly rent for studio apartments in Wichita is $580, up 1.64% from last month, but down 10.54% year-over-year, according to Zumper.Residents of Wichita need to earn $26,400 a year to afford a studio, which is $20,250 less than the median wage.\"I'm not that surprised Wichita is the most affordable. A lot of the cities in the bottom 10 are off the beaten track and not huge economic powerhouses. It's an interesting dynamic,\" Peet says.\"There are still some perhaps less desirable cities that are surprisingly unaffordable and vice versa.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

Cleveland Works steel mill in Cleveland, Ohio, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCleveland-Cliffs is looking into building a rare earths mining business, CEO Lourenco Goncalves told investors Monday.The steelmaker has two sites in Michigan and Minnesota where geological surveys have found indications of rare earths, Goncalves said in a statement on Cleveland-Cliffs' third-quarter earnings.\"We are working with the geologists to assess whether these deposits could become commercially viable — that's where we are at,\" Goncalves told analysts on the company's earnings call later Monday morning. \"We are a mining company, this isn't new territory for us.\"Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs closed more than 20% higher at $16.18. The Cleveland headquartered steelmaker is experienced in mining iron ore.Rare earths are used to manufacture magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, semiconductor fabrication, robotics and other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports. China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation.The U.S. has only one commercial rare earths mine. The Defense Department struck a deal in July with the mine's owner, MP Materials, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors have been speculating that the Trump administration will strike similar deals with other U.S. companies that are trying to stand up domestic rare earths mines and processing facilities.Cleveland-Cliffs' sites in Michigan and Minnesota, if successful, would align the company with the administration's \"broader national strategy for critical mineral independence,\" Goncalves said.\"American manufacturing shouldn't rely on China or any foreign nation for essential minerals, and Cliffs intends to be part of the solution,\" the CEO said.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 20, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday signed an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths that Albanese said includes plans for projects worth a total of up to $8.5 billion.Albanese, during a meeting with Trump at the White House, said, \"There will be $1 billion contributed from Australia and the United States over the next six months with projects that are immediately available.\"But the White House subsequently issued a fact sheet that said the countries would invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the next six months. It described the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.CNBC has asked the White House and the Australian prime minister's office for clarification on the discrepancy between what Albanese said and what the fact sheet said.The framework agreement between Australia and the U.S. comes as the Trump administration is seeking to establish a critical mineral and rare earths supply chain that is not dependent on China.Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals. They are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics and electric vehicles among other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, particularly refining and processing. The U.S. is dependent on Beijing for rare earths imports. Australia, a close U.S. ally, is one of the few countries in the world other than China that processes rare earths.Pentagon investment in AustraliaAlbanese said there will be three groups of joint projects between the two countries, which will include companies such as Alcoa. The U.S. will invest in rare earths processing in Australia, the prime minister said. One project is a joint venture between Australia, the U.S. and Japan, he said.\"What we're trying to do here is to take the opportunities which are there,\" Albanese told reporters.The Pentagon will invest in building a gallium refinery in western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tons per year, according to the White House. Alcoa announced in August that it is exploring the feasability of a gallium project with Japan at one of the company's alumina refineries in western Australia.\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them,\" Trump told reporters. The U.S. is also working with other nations to build a supply chain that isn't dependent on China, the president said.China-U.S. tensionsChina announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, pushing Beijing and Washington to the brink of a renewed trade war. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 or sooner if Beijing does not back down.\"They threatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs, but I could also threaten them with many other things, like airplanes,\" Trump said Monday.Trump confirmed he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. The U.S. president said he will visit China early next year.\"We had presidents that allowed China and other countries get away with murder,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to allow that, but we're going to have a fair deal. I want to be good to China. I love my relationship with President Xi. We have a great relationship.\"",

By design of the Founders, the judicial branch stands apart,\" she wrote. \"We rule on facts, not on supposition or conjecture, and certainly not on fabrication or propaganda.\"",

    "body": "Comfort Colors t-shirts are seen on Oct. 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCWhen looking through Wyatt Cannon's T-shirt collection, there's a common theme: the Comfort Colors label.Growing up, Cannon would often find Comfort Colors apparel when looking for souvenirs during family trips. In college, Cannon convinced his a cappella group to screen print on the company's blank shirts. When the 24-year-old has made tie-dye T-shirts for himself, it's with Comfort Colors product.\"I've loved this brand my whole life,\" said Cannon, who estimates around half of his shirts are Comfort Colors. \"This kind of material and texture and vibe of T-shirt should just be more of the standard.\"Cannon is part of a loyal and growing base of consumers driving demand for the half-century-old, Gildan-owned shirt brand. The label's ballooning success in recent years can help explain Gildan's stock outperformance and has led to plans for an expansion into additional product categories.Comfort Colors t-shirts.Courtesy: Watt CannonGildan is tight-lipped about specific brand performance and declined to share Comfort Colors' sales data with CNBC. But company executives have said Comfort Colors took off, especially over the last year, and has become a leading brand within Gildan, which also sells apparel under its namesake label and American Apparel.\"Comfort Colors is probably the fastest-growing fashion brand,\" Glenn Chamandy, Gildan's co-founder and CEO, said during a call with analysts earlier this year. \"When you walk into a souvenir store today, you'll see Comfort Colors on every single one of those tables where you used to see fashion brands before.\"'Knocking it out of the box'Gildan acquired Comfort Colors for around $100 million in 2015 in hopes of expanding within the basics category of North America's printwear market, according to a press release announcing the deal. At the time, Gildan called the Vermont-based apparel maker \"one of the most recognized brands\" in places like college bookstores and resorts.The brand publicizes that its shirts are 100% cotton from the U.S. Its \"pigment pure\" dyeing system creates the shirts' \"signature faded look\" and requires less energy and water use than other comparable processes, Gildan says.Comfort Colors' popularity exploded in 2024 with around 40% year-over-year growth, company executives have said on earnings calls. That helped drive sales in Gildan's broader activewear category 6% higher in the same period.Chamandy told analysts in late July that Comfort Colors is \"knocking it out of the box again this year\" and helped push the activewear category up 12% in the second quarter. The brand is planning to expand into hats, bags and women-specific clothing in 2026 as it rings in its 50th anniversary, Howard Upchurch, marketing and merchandise chief at Gildan, said in a statement to CNBC.Gildan, which announced earlier this year it was acquiring Hanesbrands as it further builds out its basic apparel business, is expected to report earnings at the end of this month.U.S.-listed shares of Gildan, which is a Canadian-based company, have surged more than 175% over the last five years. That's almost double the widely followed S&P 500's return over the same period.Though Gildan has touted Comfort Colors as a success story within its larger empire, consumers haven't necessarily made the connection.Cannon said he views Comfort Colors as \"crunchy\" and \"granola,\" while Gildan feels like the \"peak of consumption capitalism.\" The Connecticut-based marketing manager said Comfort Colors' unique tag of woven fabric is one quality that makes the brand feel more \"homey.\"A 'good spot'On Etsy, printers hawk Comfort Colors shirts with various designs and some even allow shoppers to upload their own. The brand has also gotten a boost from TikTok, where content creators share videos of their Comfort Colors products that viewers can purchase via the platform's shopping feature.Relative search volume for Comfort Colors in the U.S. spiked to all-time highs on Google this year, underscoring the brand's growing awareness among consumers. On the other hand, Gildan has tumbled in search popularity from a peak in 2023.Comfort Colors has amassed a \"very loyal\" base made up particularly of Gen Z customers, according to Sheng Lu, an associate professor at the University of Delaware whose research focuses on the apparel industry.These young shoppers value comfort and vintage flair, both of which align with Comfort Colors' products, Lu said. Comfort Colors' emphasis on sustainability can also bode well with a customer base that's conscious of their environmental footprint.\"This brand definitely is in a very good spot,\" Lu said.Comfort Colors' rise is particularly interesting given that the brand focuses more on selling in bulk than directly to consumers, unlike other T-shirt makers like Nike, Lu said. He explained that since Comfort Colors is mainly selling product via middlemen who can screen print on them, the shirts end up appearing more unique — which is another desirable quality for Gen Z shoppers.Behind the scenes, Gildan is likely benefiting from Comfort Colors' sourcing in the Western Hemisphere, Lu said. While countries in this region have been hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the levies have typically been less steep than those slapped on Asia, he said.Because shoppers tend to view T-shirts as a staples, these items may show stability even when consumer sentiment falls, Lu said.Frats to folkPlus, across the country, Comfort Colors shirts are outfitting social groups and sitting on merchandise stands at events. Musical acts including Maggie Rogers and Mumford & Sons printed tour merchandise on Comfort Colors shirts. Brands ranging from Coors Light to Star Trek sell its apparel, as do local bars and eateries. Women's soccer team Gotham Football Club has several official Comfort Colors spirit wear shirts.When Chelsea Green opened The Yard Milkshake Bar, she already knew of Comfort Colors from seeing the brand on college campuses. She said it's the most popular type of merchandise for The Yard Milkshake Bar, particularly with younger shoppers who are familiar the brand and sometimes use the shirts for sleepwear or as beach coverups.\"I knew that I had Comfort Colors T-shirts already in my closet,\" Green said. \"I was like, 'that's what I want.' I didn't even research it.\"To be sure, Green acknowledged that the shirts can be pricier than some competitors' and she at times ran into supply shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the color options and quality have made overcoming these obstacles worthwhile, she said.Social organizations such as Cannon's collegiate a cappella group have also turned to Comfort Colors. Similarly, fraternity Sigma Chi and sorority Pi Beta Phi each sell dozens of Comfort Colors shirts in their online shops.On a fraternity-focused Reddit forum, a user asked what T-shirt brands people used for screen printing. One respondee said Comfort Colors is their \"go-to.\" Use Comfort Colors, another said, \"or you're at risk of getting tar and feathered.\"",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press after disembarking from Air Force One upon arrival at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, Oct. 17, 2025, as he travels to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is stepping up his calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco at the very moment that the city is undergoing a post-pandemic resurgence, propelled by artificial intelligence.Crime rates are down 30% from 2024, homicide levels hit their lowest levels in 70 years and car break-ins haven't been this low in 22 years. Meanwhile, event bookings and tourism are on the rise, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is heating up.Business momentum in the city is largely built on the AI boom.New data from CBRE show venture capital funding in 2025 is expected to surpass the record high of $276 billion hit in 2021. The bulk of that investment has been in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where 80% of AI venture funding through the third quarter has been targeted to the tune of $115 billion.By the end of the September, the San Francisco Bay Area was already 35% above its previous annual investment peak, according to CBRE's VC Funding analysis.\"San Franciscans are feeling positive about the direction of our city once again,\" Daniel Lurie, the city's Democratic mayor said in a statement last week released by Governor Gavin Newsom's office. \"And we are going to continue working every single day to build on this progress and keep our city safe 365 days a year.\"The statement was meant to tout the successful efforts of local law enforcement ahead of Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference last week. The issue became particularly controversial after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to San Francisco. His sentiments were publicly supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump Administration.On Friday, facing mounting criticism, Benioff backtracked, posting on X that, \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco.\"watch nowThe Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, sparking protests and lawsuits. Over the weekend, President Trump repeated his plans to send troops to San Francisco, telling Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that, \"the difference is I think they want us in San Francisco.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the President's plans.In a statement late Monday, Lurie said San Francisco law enforcement has partnerships with federal agencies to deal with drug crimes and additional troops aren't necessary. \"I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers — and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" Lurie said. Lurie previously cheered the safety of events that took place in the last week including Dreamforce and No Kings Protests over the weekend. In contrast to Newsom, Lurie has taken a far less combative approach to Trump since taking office in January.\"San Francisco is on the rise,\" Lurie wrote in a post on X on Oct. 12, a couple days before Dreamforce was set to begin.The data support that view.Tourism spending is expected to increase modestly this year to $9.35 billion, up from $9.26 billion, according to the San Francisco Travel Association. Conferences, sporting events such as NBA All-Star weekend, and music festivals like Outside Lands have contributed to the growth.The commercial real estate market is also recovering as Covid-era work from home policies get slowly unwound.Tech companies increased their share of leasing activity by square footage to 53% in 2025, the highest since 2019, CBRE said. Apartment rental prices are surging as well. Multifamily rentals increased 6% in August, much more than the 3.75% jump in Chicago, the city with the second-steepest climb, according to CoStar.Ted Egan, chief economist for San Francisco, told CNBC in an interview that \"housing is probably as cheap as it's going to get for a while.\"There remains plenty of room for improvement. The city has lost key tenants in its downtown shopping district in recent years, including its flagship Nordstrom store. The Nordstrom location was part of San Francisco City Centre, which was the city's largest mall but is now effectively empty.Office vacancies remained high at 33.6% in the third quarter, according to Cushman and Wakefield. Homelessness and open drug use are longstanding issues, heavily concentrated in certain parts of the city.But Egan said that, in addition to the data, he's noticed a significant change in the city's health.\"It seems cleaner and safer now than it's ever been in any of the time that I've been here,\" said Egan, who's worked in San Francisco for more than 20 years. \"I still think it's a great place to move to because it's got tons of economic opportunity. It's got tons of long-term economic strengths for people starting out in their career.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO faces pushback over support for potential National Guard deploymentwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 17, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a shift in support toward Russia's Vladimir Putin as he looks for a quick end to the war in Ukraine, likely striking fear into Ukrainian officials.Trump held a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the potential supply of U.S. long-range cruise missiles, Tomahawks, on the agenda.Zelenskyy walked away from the meeting not only empty-handed, but apparently upbraided by Trump, who said Ukraine should accept Russia's terms for ending the war — by handing over the entire eastern territory of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters this weekend, Trump said for Donbas to be \"cut the way it is.\"\"It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,\" he said on Air Force One on Sunday. \"They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done.\"In the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump also warned the Ukrainian leader that Putin had told him — in a lengthy phone call on Thursday in which they agreed to hold in-person talks in Hungary — that Russia would \"destroy\" Ukraine if it did not agree to the demand.The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy descended into a \"shouting match,\" the Financial Times reported, with Trump \"cursing all the time,\" according to unnamed people familiar with the matter cited by the FT.In a Truth Social post, Trump described the meeting as \"very interesting, and cordial,\" but said he had \"strongly suggested\" to both leaders that it was time to end the war.\"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" he said in the post Friday.watch nowZelenskyy put on a brave face, telling NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" in an interview recorded Friday after the meeting with Trump, that \"we are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning.\" He also remained optimistic despite leaving the White House without the Tomahawk missiles he was coveting.\"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" Zelenskyy told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in the interview, which aired Sunday.He also said he was ready to join Putin and Trump's upcoming summit in Budapest, which could take place in the next few weeks. Whether Zelenskyy will be invited to Hungary remains to be seen, however.As well as declining to provide Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, which Trump had previously mooted in an apparent bid to bring Russia to the negotiating table, Trump also mused about giving security guarantees to both Kyiv and Moscow, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the talks.The White House declined to comment further to CNBC on Monday.As for Moscow, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told CNBC on Monday in emailed comments that the Kremlin welcomes \"Trump's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Ukraine.\"US President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on October 17, 2025. Tom Brenner | Afp | Getty ImagesIs Trump ready to pressure Putin?Close followers of Trump-Putin-Zelenskyy relations fear the U.S. president is easily swayed by the veteran Russian leader's arguments over Ukraine. They say Trump does not appear ready or willing to exert more pressure on Putin, be it in the form of more arms transfers to Kyiv, or more economic restrictions on Russia.\"We keep dismissing Donald Trump as kind of 'Everybody's Fool' because he's so bombastic and says many things a mile a minute, but he actually is being very transactional about the relationship,\" Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at The New School, told CNBC \"Squawk Box\" on Friday.\"Everybody keeps pulling him one side or another, be it the Russian side or Ukrainian side. But he's not taking sides, and he's really playing, interestingly, both hands.\"She noted that Trump still wants to win over Putin, but is also keeping him on a \"tight leash,\" demonstrated by his threat to give Ukraine more weapons.\"So far, I think it is working. He's not giving either side what they wanted, but he keeps going, and eventually, potentially, they may agree to some sort of a peace agreement,\" she said.Michael O'Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the Brookings Institution, told CNBC that Putin is likely to wait Trump out.\"I think it would be more effective [for Trump] to combine the military threat with greater economic pressure, but we'll see maybe that comes later,\" he noted Friday.watch nowO'Hanlon said there were several ways the U.S. could ramp up the pressure on Moscow, including another U.S. aid package for Ukraine and a bigger crackdown on Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of tankers facilitating shipments of Russian crude to circumvent the oil price cap and sanctions.\"We don't do much trading with Russia, but, of course, other countries do, and I think it's time to talk to not just India, but also China about a strategy whereby they would consider reducing their interaction, their economic interaction, and you threaten secondary sanctions if you don't get that kind of help,\" he said.\"So those are the different pieces. Not all of them have to happen at the exact same minute, and they can happen. They can be phased in, but I think President Trump is a little too fixated on just the Tomahawks, plus his personal rapport with Putin, and I don't think that's going to be enough [to stop Russia].\"",

    "body": "Shares of U.S.-listed companies related to the rare earth supply chain climbed on Monday as investors continued to weigh the impact of Chinese export restrictions on domestic producers.  Rare earths are minerals that are essential to many aspects of modern life, particularly for the technology sector and the energy transition, as they are used in everything from semiconductors, fighter jets to the motors of electric vehicles.Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement on Monday to invest in joint ventures to stand up a critical mineral and rare earth supply chain that is not dependent on China.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview last week that the Trump administration will set a price floors for a range of industries, including rare earths, to combat market manipulation by China. Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors consider which firms might be future targets for the government's industrial policy.NioCorp led the sector's gains with an increase of nearly 20%. Energy Fuels rose about 7% while USA Rare Earth rallied nearly 14% and Perpetua Resources advanced more than 7%. MP Materials was also in the green, moving more than 2% higher. Canada's Lithium Americas increased nearly 3%The moves come as the Trump administration is working to build up its own domestic rare earth supply chain.The Defense Department struck a deal in July with MP Materials, which is the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors are anticipating that the administration will back additional miners. William Blair initiated coverage of USA Rare Earth on Monday with an outperform rating on the expectation that the Trump administration \"could soon take a material stake in the company.\"Michael Silver, the CEO and chairman of rare earths distributor American Elements told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week that the U.S. has enough heavy rare metals for its military applications, but the supply chain squeeze could impact EVs, lasers, and \"quite a lot of commercial technology.\" watch nowGetting mines up and running should be \"treated as national priorities,\" Silver said, adding that there will likely be government involvement and subsidies.  Under new rules that were announced earlier this month, foreign companies now need Beijing's approval to export rare earths and are required to explain what they will be used for.  - CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowTop White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett on Monday predicted the government shutdown is \"likely to end sometime this week.\"But if that does not happen, the Trump administration may impose \"stronger measures\" to force Democrats to cooperate, Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"The comments came deep into the third week of the shutdown, which is dragging on with no clear end in sight amid a partisan fight in the Senate over federal funding priorities.Republicans want to pass a short-term resolution to resume funding at current levels. Democrats demand that any stopgap bill include additional spending on health-care protections, including an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are due to expire at year's end.The GOP-backed bill failed to pass the Senate for the 11th time on Monday evening. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines.watch nowHassett said on CNBC that he has heard from the Senate that Democrats thought it would be \"bad optics\" to vote to reopen the government before this weekend's massive nationwide \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump.\"Now there's a shot that this week, things will come together, and very quickly,\" Hassett said. \"The moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government, at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

But with numerous polls showing more voters blame Trump and Republicans for the impasse — and indicating strong support for extending the ACA health insurance subsidies — Democrats mostly haven't budged.\"Every day gets better for us,\" Schumer told Punchbowl News earlier this month, \"because we've thought about this long in advance and we knew that health care would be the focal point on Sept. 30 and we prepared for it.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare tax credits in exchange for opening the government.But top Democrats appear to be rejecting Thune's entreaty. Instead, some Democrats are calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.Hassett said Monday that Trump \"has been very active throughout this process, but it's also his position that this is a thing that the Senate needs to work out.\"",

    "body": "Electric vehicles are cheaper to maintain than cars with internal combustion engines, but they tend to lose money — fast.It varies by model, but in general EVs depreciate by 13% more over a five-year period than the overall market, and some plummet in value even more rapidly, according to iSeeCars, which tracks the used car market.It's enough to make a new car buyer hesitate if they are worried about how much they will get back when they try to sell the car. In addition, automakers have said they're trying to broaden the appeal of EVs to more cost-conscious mainstream shoppers. Up until now, the EV market has been heavy on higher priced vehicles aimed at luxury buyers.\"New car shoppers, especially wealthy ones, are less price sensitive,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst of iSeeCars. \"They don't care about the depreciation. Used car shoppers are not like that. Every used car buyer, by nature of being a used car buyer, is value oriented.\"There are a few big reasons EVs suffer greater depreciation.Historically they have been more heavily incentivized, which tends to hurt resale values since a used buyer won't pay as much for a car that did — or even could have — received discounts. Incentives hurt resale values for all kinds of cars, but EVs have received some additional ones, including the now expired federal government rebates.EVs received about twice the incentives as gas-burning cars — including those from dealers and automakers in August, for example, according to Cox Automotive. Even that was a drop from the record set in July.There is also the rapidly changing pace of technology. The maximum available EV range for example has more than doubled in the last decade, and the median range has tripled, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Some evidence has suggested longer-range EVs tend to depreciate more slowly.Despite all the advances, EVs remain a relatively niche product with a small, albeit growing, share of the market. U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids, hit a market share of 10.5% for the first nine months of the year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.But that smaller share limits their marketability.There are big changes ahead. An explosion of used EVs is inevitably on its way, and the mix of models is likely to be different.\"We have, you know, $30,000 to $35,000 EVs coming from the domestic market — from Ford, from Chevy,\" said Alex Yurchenko, managing director of valuation services for J.D. Power. \"So you have now a much better mix of vehicles, in terms of affordability.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

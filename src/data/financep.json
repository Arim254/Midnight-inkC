    "body": "American Express announces the new platinum business card.Courtesy: American ExpressAmerican Express is finding that even for a provider of credit cards to the affluent, it pays to focus on the highest of high rollers.The company recently shifted marketing dollars to its refreshed Platinum card, which carries an $895 annual fee, and away from no-fee cash back cards, CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts Friday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.Doing that helps to boost overall spending levels as high-end consumers continue to thrive, a tactic that leads to both rising fee revenue from premium cards and lower loan defaults, executives said.\"We have the ability … to be really flexible with our marketing investments, and we saw a tremendous demand for premium products, particularly the Platinum card,\" Squeri said.\"The overall portfolio is slowly getting more premium [as] the Platinum portfolio is growing at a very fast pace,\" he added.AmEx's strategy shift is the latest example of the so-called \"K-shaped\" U.S. economy playing out, in which wealthy consumers continue to spend freely while others rein in their expenses. Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are seen in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington on Dec. 19, 2025, as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender. Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Friday is releasing more than 3 million additional pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said.The large release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ was not complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to the notorious sex offender Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Blanche said Friday the DOJ was not releasing the rest of the more than 6 million total pages that have been identified as potentially responsive to the Epstein Transparency Act.Speaking at a press conference at DOJ headquarters in Washington, Blanche said that more than 500 DOJ lawyers and other personnel had spent the past 75 days reviewing potential material related to Epstein and determining what needed to be released under the law.Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche speaks during a press conference at the Justice Department in Washington, Jan. 30, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | Reuters\"We're releasing more than 3 million pages today, and not the 6 million pages that we collected,\" Blanche said. \"That means that the department produced approximately 3½ million pages in compliance with the act.\"He said that no more documents would be released. The large release on Friday comes weeks after DOJ released a much-smaller tranche of Epstein-related documents on Dec. 19.\"Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive documentation, document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act,\" Blanche said.Some of the material released relates to Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to abuse. Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

We did not protect President Trump ... or anybody.\"President Donald Trump had been friends with Epstein for years before the two men had a falling out in the mid-2000s.\"There's not some tranche of super-secret documents about Jeffrey Epstein that we're withholding,\" Blanche said.",

Denis Balibouse | ReutersGold and silver prices plunged Friday, as President Donald Trump's nomination for the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, appeared to relieve concerns about the central bank's independence and sent the dollar soaring. Spot silver was down 30% at $80.55 an ounce, trading at its lows of the day. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot silverMeanwhile, spot gold shed around 11% to trade at $4,812.71 an ounce. Gold futures dropped 9.1% to $4,980, trading below $5,000.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSpot goldThe sharp moves down were initially triggered by reports of Warsh's nomination. However, they gained steam in afternoon U.S. trading as investors who piled into the metals raced to book profits. Metals were also under pressure as the dollar spiked higher, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy gold and silver and spoiling the theory that metals would replace the greenback as the globe's reserve currency. The dollar index last traded around 0.8% higher. \"This is getting crazy,\" said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. \"Most of this is probably 'forced selling.' This has been the hottest asset for day traders and other short-term traders recently. So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out.\"Trump picks WarshNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days. In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI's Krishna Guha said the market was \"trading Warsh hawkish.\"\"The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower,\" the firm's vice chairman said.\"But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker.\"Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday that a \"perfect storm\" of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington's threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets. \"The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that's been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,\" Wewel said, prior to Trump's announcement. 'Even good assets can sell-off'Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 66% and 135%, respectively, over the course of the year.Coeur Mining lost 17%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen more than 62% lower. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds were headed for their worst days on record. Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely \"a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.\" \"Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,\" she said. \"When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn't accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.\"Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold's run to the $5,000 mark had happened \"too easily.\" He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize. \"Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,\" he said. \"The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump's trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersA federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing trade secrets related to the search company's AI technology.The jury found 38 year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets related to stealing thousands of pages of confidential information from Google to benefit the People's Republic of China, according to court documents. \"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government,\" said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. \"Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable.\"The case marks the first conviction on AI-related economic espionage charges in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice. Google executives and U.S. leaders have been vocal about the AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis recently told CNBC that Chinese AI models might be \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western capabilities.The jury's decision comes after Ding was originally indicted in 2024. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria for the Northern District of California oversaw the 11-day trial that led to Thursday's decision. Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding stole more than 2,000 pages of Google's AI trade secrets and uploaded them to his personal Google Cloud account, the DOJ said Friday. At the time, Ding had been affiliated with two tech companies based in China and was in the process of creating his own tech company.The trade secrets contained detailed information about the architecture of Google's custom Tensor Processing Unit chips and the company's graphics processing unit systems, according to the DOJ. The trade secrets also included details about Google's custom-built SmartNIC, a specialized network interface card that enables high-speed communication across its AI supercomputers and cloud networking systems.Ding's attorney Grant Fondo reportedly argued that Google didn't do enough to protect the information. He argued that the documents in question were available to thousands of employees and therefore could not have contained trade secrets, adding \"Google chose openness over security,\" according to Courthouse News Service.Ding, whose next court date is Tuesday, faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each count of theft of trade secrets and 15 years in prison for each count of economic espionage, according to the DOJ.\"We're grateful to the jury for making sure justice was served today, sending a clear message that stealing trade secrets has serious consequences,\" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement to CNBC.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stakewatch now",

    "body": "China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Countries that shunned China during its trade dispute with the U.S. are now sending their leaders to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping — and are keen to strike business deals.At least five national leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, have visited Xi in January alone. Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft's stock was largely flat on Friday, after the stock saw its biggest daily decline since 2020, sliding 10% Thursday after it reported earnings.Shares fell despite the company's second-quarter earnings beating analyst revenue expectations. Like other hyperscalers, Microsoft has invested huge sums in its AI infrastructure buildout. But Meta reported huge AI spending on the same day and its stock jumped 8%.Why did Microsoft's stock drop?Investors latched onto the growth of Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure and other cloud services, which came in at 39% below StreetAccount's 39.4% consensus. Those areas saw 40% growth in the fiscal first quarter.The company's CFO Amy Hood said that the cloud business' results could have been higher if the company had allocated more data center infrastructure to customers rather than prioritising in-house needs.Implied operating margin for third-quarter also came up short, with Microsoft calling for about $12.6 billion in revenue from the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows, which was lower than StreetAccount's $13.7 billion consensus.What analysts are sayingIn a post-earnings note on Thursday, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said most investors focused solely on Azure growth to judge the health of Microsoft's business, especially in its performance around AI.\"It now looks like the company will not really accelerate Azure further from here, due to the law of large numbers and extra capacity being used for its own, higher-margin, first party offerings like Co-Pilot and its own AI R&D efforts,\" he said.\"Investors need, we believe, to understand that management made a cognizant decision to focus on what is best for the company long term rather than driving the stock up this quarter or even over last quarter and a few quarters to come (as capacity constraints likely abate),\" Mark L. Moerdler, analyst at Bernstein said in a Thursday note.There was still plenty of bullishness in the market for Microsoft stock. Wells Fargo, in a Thursday note, rated shares as overweight, adding that its \"early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market\" justify its high trading price.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a prolonged odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank.The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post announcing the selection.The pick of Warsh, 55, likely won't ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street's view that he wouldn't always do Trump's bidding.\"He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,\" said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,\" added Bahnsen.Stock market futures nevertheless were slightly negative Friday morning, though off their lows since Warsh's appointment became clear.Warsh now faces Senate confirmation. If approved, he will take over the position in May, when Powell's term expires. Warsh will fill the Board of Governors position currently held by Governor Stephen Miran, whose term expires Saturday. Miran can continue to serve until a replacement is named. Read more CNBC news on Kevin WarshWho is Kevin Warsh?

Tillis will oppose Trump Fed chair pick Warsh until Powell probe resolvedTrump finally makes his Fed chair pick — what Kevin Warsh means for investorsHassett praises Trump's pick of Warsh to lead Fed, says he has his 'dream job' already'Regime change' coming?Since Powell's confirmation in 2018, during Trump's first term, the president has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, Trump kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed's massive renovation of its Washington, D.C., headquarters.Beyond interest rates, Warsh comes to the Fed at a time when policymakers have taken a looser hand on banking regulations. Among the changes, pushed by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, herself once in the running for Fed chair, are lower capital requirements, reducing supervision and supervisory staff, and backing the Fed out of ancillary efforts like pushing banks to prepare for climate events.For his part, Warsh in a CNBC interview last summer called for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\"The credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the Fed, in my view,\" he said during the July interview. It's a position that could put him in an adversarial role at an institution where consensus building is key to policy implementation.Trump's decision to nominate Warsh comes at one of the most precarious moments for the U.S. central bank in decades — with inflation not fully defeated, government borrowing escalating and the Fed itself facing unusually direct political pressure over how it conducts monetary policy.Most recently, the Justice Department subpoenaed Powell regarding the construction project. In an uncharacteristically blunt response, Powell charged the move was a \"pretext\" to push the Fed into following Trump's orders and ease policy further.To that end, the nomination comes as questions about Fed independence, a bedrock of central bank credibility, have moved from academic debate into concern. Trump and other administration officials have  floated ideas ranging from tighter White House oversight to changes in how the central bank sets rates, including forcing the chair to consult with the president on rate decisions.\"I want to keep it nice and pure, but he certainly wants to cut rates,\" Trump said Friday afternoon during an Oval Office session with reporters. He added that he has not talked with Warsh about cutting rates, though the president said that would be a litmus test for candidates.The nomination ends a competitive derby that at one point included 11 candidates. They spanned from former and current Fed officials to prominent economists and Wall Street pros in an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Ultimately, the field was winnowed to five then four, with Trump last week hinting to CNBC that he had arrived at his choice. Among the finalists were current Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.\"Christopher Waller, Rick Rieder, and others, were interviewed for the Fed position. They all would have been outstanding, and have a great and unlimited future with \"TRUMP.\" Such amazing talent in our Country,\" Trump said in a separate Truth Social post. Rieder, thought to be the favorite as recently as Thursday afternoon, congratulated Warsh on the nomination.\"This has been an incredible honor for me,\" Rieder said in a statement to CNBC. \"I congratulate Kevin on his nomination and think he will serve the institution and our nation very well.\"Trump praised Hassett and said he was so good at NEC that he didn't want to move him.\"He is doing such an outstanding job working with me and my team at the White House, that I just didn't want to let him go,\" he said.In a CNBC interview, Hassett said he was not disappointed and wished Warsh well.\"I've got my dream job,\" he said. I think President Trump made a great choice, and I'm really thrilled and humbled by all the kind things he said about me. You know, the bottom line is that the economic team in this White House ... I think we've been hitting on all cylinders, and it's a really bad time to change teams.\"watch nowPolitical challengesFrom here, the nominee faces a tough road.Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has indicated he will block any Fed nominees until the Justice Department probe is finished. \"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy. However, the Department of Justice continues to pursue a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell based on committee testimony that no reasonable person could construe as possessing criminal intent,\" Tillis posted Friday on social media site X.\"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved,\" he added.Hassett told CNBC that the DOJ issue \"could get resolved quickly. The White House is highly, highly confident that Kevin Warsh is a great nominee and that he should be confirmed as soon as possible, and every single resource we have at our disposal is behind him, and behind that outcome.\"The nomination gained support elsewhere in Congress. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate banking committee, praised Warsh's \"deep knowledge of markets and monetary policy that will be essential in this role.\"\"The Federal Reserve's decisions touch every American household, from mortgage rates to retirement savings, and President Trump has been clear that bringing accountability and credibility to the Federal Reserve is a priority, and his nomination of Kevin Warsh reflects that focus,\" Scott said.The issues, though, are more than political.Though Trump has insisted that inflation has been vanquished, it remains a good deal from the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, the labor market has slowed, with the economy current in a no-fire, no-hire climate that poses another challenge to Fed policy.In any event, markets don't expect much action from the new chair: Traders are pricing in at most two more cuts this year before the benchmark fed funds rate lands around 3%, which policymakers have indicates is the long-run \"neutral\" rate that neither boosts nor hinders economic growth.Then there's the issue of what happens with Powell.Though chairs historically have resigned their Fed positions after being removed as chair, that may not be the case this time around. Powell has two years remaining in his governor term, and he could choose to serve it as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to compromise Fed independence. The Supreme Court already is weighing Trump's move to unseat Governor Lisa Cook, a case that ultimately could decide what powers a president has over Fed board members.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor said it will report pretax charges of $600 million in its fourth-quarter results due to adjustments in its employee pension plans and other postretirement benefits.The Detroit automaker said the special charges, which will affect its net income but not its adjusted results or cash, are split between domestic plans and those outside the U.S.\"The remeasurement loss for U.S. plans was largely driven by actuarial losses compared to plan assumptions,\" Ford said in a public filing after markets closed Thursday. \"The remeasurement loss for non-U.S. plans was largely driven by changes in key plan measurement assumptions, such as improved life expectancy.\" On an after-tax basis, Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to decrease its net income by about $500 million based on the tax impact in the jurisdictions where there are remeasurement gains and losses.Ford said its retirement plans remain fully funded and the charges would not change its expectations for pension contributions in 2026.The new special charges are in addition to about $19.5 billion in special items the company disclosed last month related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments, most of which Ford said would occur during the fourth quarter.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after markets close on Feb. 10.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. In keeping with the president's push for lower interest rates, Warsh is expected to be more supportive of cutting the Fed's key benchmark rate later this year. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" said Trump in a Truth Social post on Friday. Fed board members are nominated by the president but must be approved by the Senate. If confirmed, Warsh will take over for Powell when his term ends in May, opening the door to a potential change in the direction of monetary policy over the second half of 2026.Warsh, a former Fed governor with a Wall Street background, has been critical of the central bank's handling of inflation in the past and told CNBC in July that its hesitancy to cut interest rates undermined its credibility. \"Based on his past statements and actions in his previous stint as a Fed Governor, Warsh was by far the most hawkish of the four final candidates for Fed Chair,\" said Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhat Trump Fed chair pick Kevin Warsh may mean for consumersAverage tax refunds may be $1,000 higher, White House says.

Longer-term rates, like mortgage rates, are more influenced by inflation and other economic factors.\"There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn't going to be cutting rates in the short term,\" David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Kevin Warsh, Fellow in Economics at the Hoover Institution and lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017. Brendan McDermid | Reuters\"It's too early to judge Kevin Warsh as Fed chair,\" said Mark Higgins, senior vice president at Index Fund Advisors and author of \"Investing in U.S. Financial History: Understanding the Past to Forecast the Future.\" \"What is clear from history, though, is that allowing inflation to persist at elevated levels for too long makes it much harder and far more painful to extinguish later,\" Higgins said.In the 1970s, then-President Richard Nixon, pressured Fed Chair Arthur Burns to keep interest rates low — and give the economy some gas — in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election. That set the stage for runaway inflation, economists now say. Consumer prices surged in the decade that followed and the inflation rate peaked at around 15% in 1980, which remains the highest rate since the post-World War II period.The Fed ultimately, under new leadership, raised interest rates to punishing levels to rein in inflation, leading to surging borrowing costs in the '80s.\"The message to households is uncomfortable but important,\" Higgins said. \"Accepting shorter, more acute economic pain now is preferable to prolonged inflation that continues to erode purchasing power. History is unambiguous on this point.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "watch nowPanama's top court has ruled against Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, saying a concession held by a subsidiary of the firm to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional.The outcome is widely seen as a victory for the Trump administration's security ambitions in the Western Hemisphere, with the U.S. seeking to counter China's strategic influence in the region.In a brief statement published late Thursday, the Supreme Court of Panama said the terms under which Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, runs the port of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic violated the country's constitution and were no longer valid.The court said it came to its decision after \"extensive deliberation\" but did not provide further details on the next steps.It also raises questions about the future ownership of some Panama Canal operations, including CK Hutchison's proposed $23 billion sale of 43 ports across the globe to a consortium led by BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). BlackRock declined to comment on the ruling. CK Hutchison and MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Read moreThe decision comes roughly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal, saying the critically important waterway was \"vital to our country\" and claiming, \"it's being operated by China.\" The Trump administration has made blocking China's influence over the Panama Canal one of its top priorities.\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal but we have superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the Donroe Doctrine,\" Trump said earlier this month, shortly after U.S. troops conducted an operation to capture Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.\"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,\" Trump said. China pledges to take necessary measuresPPC, which has held the contract to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal since the 1990s, said on Friday that the decision was inconsistent with the relevant legal framework.\"The new ruling, based on available information, lacks legal basis and jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity but also the rule of law and legal certainty in the country,\" PPC said in a statement. Shares of CK Hutchison closed 4.6% lower on Friday as Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped over 2% for the session.Aerial photograph of the Panama Canal at sunset, March 2025.

A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that the decision was \"contrary to the laws governing Panama's approval of the relevant franchises, and that the companies will reserve all rights, including legal proceedings.\" The spokesperson added that Beijing would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. — CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.",

The potential maximum sentence for the remaining two counts for causing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death under federal stalking laws is \"life in prison without parole,\" Garnett noted. Thompson was fatally shot on a midtown Manhattan street in December 2024.The third count accused Mangione of the murder of Thompson through the use of a firearm during that alleged stalking.

    "body": "watch nowExxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said Friday that Venezuela needs to transition to democracy in order for investment in the South American nation's dilapidated oil industry to make sense. President Donald Trump is pressuring oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela to rebuild the country's oil industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. But Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that Venezuela is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. The Exxon CEO's blunt assessment angered the president who threatened to cut the oil major out of any future investment in the country.Woods stood by his assessment in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He said the government in Caracas needs to make major reforms for Exxon to seriously consider returning to Venezuela. \"Those priorities start with one, stabilizing the country,\" Woods told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" \"Second is to kick-start the economy and try to recover some of the damage that's been done over the decades of abuse that the dictators brought in, and then ultimately to transition into representative government.\" The Trump administration has not laid out a clear plan for Venezuela to hold elections and transition to a democratic government. Senior administration officials have said they are focused right now on stabilizing the country and improving its economy through oil sales. The U.S. has been working with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, who is a long-standing insider in the authoritarian regime that former President Hugo Chavez built. The cooperation with Rodriguez has raised concern among some observers that the current regime could remain in place so long as it meets the Trump administration's demands on oil. Exxon exited Venezuela in 2007 after its assets were seized by the Chavez regime. It has billions of dollars in outstanding claims against Caracas from the nationalization. \"Frankly, from our perspective, there's a principle that we stand on that if you don't uphold the sanctity of the contracts, if you choose to instead to steal the investments that we made and undermine the work that we've been doing, that we can't continue to work with you,\" Woods said. Trump told oil industry CEOs at the White House meeting that his administration is not planning to force Venezuela to play claims from the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said on Jan. 9. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world but its energy infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. Investment to repair Venezuela's infrastructure could prove financially challenging right now as a surplus of crude oil in the world has depressed prices. Oil prices in 2025 posted their steepest annual loss since 2020 as OPEC+ increased production and the U.S. continued to pump oil at a strong clip.Earlier Friday, Exxon reported fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, but both profit and revenue were down from the year-ago period due to weak crude prices. Notably, Exxon achieved its highest full-year net production in more than 40 years at 4.7 million barrels per day. It pumped 4.98 million bpd in the quarter with its assets in the Permian Basin and Guyana setting output records for the period.Exxon's competitor, Chevron, is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron says it can increase production in Venezuela by 50% over the next 18 to 24 months. While Exxon's stock was down more than 1% after reporting its results, its shares have had a strong start to the year. The stock has gained nearly 16% in 2026, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.6% bump. ",

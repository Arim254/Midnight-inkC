    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party (GOP) member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he has canceled a fresh military attack on Venezuela, saying the two countries \"are working well together,\" on rebuilding the nation's oil and gas infrastructure.Writing on Truth Social on Friday, Trump noted Venezuela's release of \"large numbers of political prisoners\" which he called \"a very important and smart gesture.\"\"Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,\" Trump said.In a press conference on Jan. 3, Trump had suggested it was unlikely a second attack on Venezuela would be deemed necessary due to what he called the success of the first operation. \"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so,\" he told reporters at the time. \"So we were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so. We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week. On Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country. Since Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure. In his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday. Chevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems. Venezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.On Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article. ",

    "body": "A 'For Sale' sign is posted beside property for sale in Alhambra, California.Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesMortgage rates fell sharply on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump said on social media that he is instructing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds. \"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he said in the Truth Social post.The rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 5.99%, matching the low from Feb. 2, 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily. Fannie Mae and Freddie, which are in government conservatorship, do not originate home loans. They buy loans from lenders, bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, and sell them to investors — thereby replenishing lender funds for new loans and keeping interest rates lower and more stable for homebuyers.Purchasing more mortgage-backed bonds or securities does move mortgage rates lower. In the first two months of the Covid pandemic, as markets reeled, the Federal Reserve purchased $580 billion in agency MBS. It then continued buying more throughout the year. From March 2020 through June 2021, the Federal Reserve increased its agency MBS holdings from $1.4 trillion to $2.3 trillion, according to the Dallas Fed. The Federal Reserve also lowered its own lending rate to zero. The combination brought the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage to record lows, hitting just 2.75% at the start of 2021, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"How big a deal is $200 billion? This depends on a few factors, but the reaction in the MBS market is enough to tell you that it matters,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily which tracks rates closely and is already seeing them fall just from the news of the announcement.While it is still not known how quickly this would start and how long it will take, analysts are predicting where mortgage rates could end up; most put the drop somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points, some even lower. \"We believe that $200bn of MBS purchases could drive a ~10-25bps reduction in mortgage rates, potentially reducing the current 30-year headline mortgage rate to roughly 6.0% (current 6.21%). While still elevated relative to the average outstanding mortgage rate of 4.4% and the 3.25% levels as recently as Jan 2022, this decline may provide a boost to both new construction demand and existing home turnover,\" analysts at UBS wrote.Put simply, if rates were to drop even to 5.9%, for someone buying the median-priced home — which is right around $425,000, according to the National Association of Realtors — using a 30-year fixed mortgage with a 20% down payment, the monthly payment would drop by $118. For some, that may not seem like a lot, but for first-time buyers on the edge of affordability, it could make a difference. They would still, however, need to save for the down payment, which is currently the biggest hurdle for most first-timers. Homebuilder stocks rallied on the news, but they were already buying down mortgage rates prior to this well into the 5% range. Their concerns lately have been more focused on increasing costs from tariffs and a continued labor shortage. That said, just the news of this could have an impact on buyer demand for the builders. \"I think psychologically it will help,\" said Ivy Zelman, executive vice president of research and securities at Zelman, a Walker & Dunlop company. \"I think that today, people that have been looking that didn't even know builders were offering mortgage rate buydowns might step into the market.\"But Zelman also points out that in the broader home market it's not just the mortgage rate, but overall affordability that is keeping buyers sidelined. Consumers are stretched, and home prices are close to 50% higher than they were pre-pandemic, ironically because of those record-low mortgage rates brought on by MBS purchases.\"This is not enough to really get the market going because we know people can't qualify even at 4.99%. They can say that the mortgage rates are going to go down to below 5, but we have people that still can't qualify at 4.99%, so I think there's more work to be done,\" Zelman said.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.This could also help builder margins, which have been shrinking lately because of higher costs.\"From a demand perspective, [it is] maybe a marginal benefit from the positive psychological impact on consumers,\" said John Lovallo, analyst at UBS. \"Bigger is the potential ability for builders to begin pulling back on incentives to some extent which would be very accretive to gross margins.\"The drop, however, could also help current homeowners to save on their monthly payments through a refinance. Rates have already been dropping steadily, with the 30-year fixed down from it's recent peak of 7.16% one year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan were already 133% higher year over year before this announcement, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The general rule of thumb is that a refinance is only worth the cost if you can save more than 75 basis points on a mortgage rate. This would add many more potential candidates to the refinance pool, especially those who took out their loans over the last two years. The vast majority of homeowners, however, still have rates below 4%. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump is meeting Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolas Maduro.The CEOs of Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Shell and a representative from Chevron are attending, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. Representatives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon are also present.Trump said the U.S. will decide which oil companies enter Venezuela. The White House will \"cut a deal with the companies\" Friday or shortly thereafter, he said at the meeting.   \"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said.Secertary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris  Wright, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum are attending the meeting as well.The White House called the meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Trump said in the immediate aftermath of Maduro's overthrow that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. But the industry has been mostly silent as the security situation and stability of the government in Caracas remains murky. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. It will cost tens of billions of dollars to return Venezuelan production to its historic levels, Energy Secretary Wright said at a Goldman Sachs' conference in Miami Wednesday. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short- to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "Close-up of a hand holding a cellphone displaying the Amazon Pharmacy system, Lafayette, California, Sept. 15, 2021.Smith Collection | Gado | Getty ImagesAmazon announced Friday it now offers Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight loss pill through its digital pharmacy.Novo Nordisk began rolling out an oral version of its injectable obesity drug Wegovy in the U.S. on Monday, offering a starting dose for cash-paying patients at $149 per month. Patients with insurance coverage can get the pill for as low as $25 a month. The daily pill enters the market with some of the lowest cash prices in the booming obesity and diabetes drug space, which costly weekly injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have long dominated. Its availability on Amazon underscores Novo Nordisk's strategy to expand beyond traditional channels and reach new patients.Amazon said eligible customers with insurance can pay as little as $25 for a one-month supply of the drug. Its cash-pay option will start at $149 a month. In the coming weeks, Amazon said it will also offer the Wegovy pill through its prescription vending kiosks, which are located in select One Medical clinics. The e-commerce giant launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 as part of its deeper push into the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry. The service was born out of its acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for roughly $750 million in 2018. It then bought primary-care clinic One Medical in 2022 for $3.9 billion. Amazon has sought to attract users to its service by offering speedy delivery and price transparency. It offers same-day prescription delivery to nearly half of U.S. consumers, Amazon said. The company hasn't disclosed how many users Amazon Pharmacy has, but analysts have estimated it could generate about $2 billion in annual revenue. In October, Weight Watchers said it would partner with Amazon Pharmacy to deliver weight loss medications for its members. Amazon Pharmacy has also collaborated with Eli Lilly to help deliver certain prescription medications, including its obesity drug Zepbound, purchased through the drugmaker's direct-to-consumer website.After its launch this week, the Novo Nordisk pill is also available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy.Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when.Health experts say oral options could expand obesity treatment access in the U.S., likely reaching entirely new people who were afraid of needles or believed injections were too serious or aggressive for them to start.Eli Lilly has a rival obesity pill that is slated to win Food and Drug Administration approval later this year.",

    "body": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attend an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Japan Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-Hoon | ReutersOpenAI and SoftBank announced plans to invest $1 billion in SB Energy as part of a strategic partnership that will support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.The partnership is part of the $500 billion Stargate commitment that OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle announced last January at the White House, according to a Friday release. As part of the agreement, SB Energy will build and operate OpenAI's 1.2 gigawatt data center site in Milam County, Texas that was announced in September. \"Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data center infrastructure and energy development and OpenAI's deep domain expertise in data center engineering,\" Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, said in a statement on Friday. \"The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimized AI data centers.\"SB Energy is backed by SoftBank and Ares Management. The company develops, owns and operates  energy projects across the U.S. It has offices in Redwood City, California, San Diego and Denver, according to its website. In addition to the investment, SB Energy has also formed a non-exclusive preferred partnership with OpenAI and SoftBank to develop \"a new model for data center builds,\" according to the release. That model will combine OpenAI's first-party data center design with SB Energy's \"proven expertise in speed, cost discipline, and integrated energy delivery,\" the companies said.The company has several multi-gigawatt data center campuses in development, and initial facilities are under construction and expected to enter service this year, the release said. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI have become increasingly intertwined over the past year. Two months after the Stargate project was announced, OpenAI said it closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.SoftBank said in November that it's sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as it looks to capitalize on its \"all in\" bet on OpenAI.The ChatGPT maker is burning through mounds of cash, and is still far from profitability, meaning it remains heavily reliant on outside capital.OpenAI has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company was on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate in 2025, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.WATCH: Judge rules Elon Musk’s lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trialwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowNew video that appears to show Renee Nicole Good in her car right before she was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis was posted Friday on social media by the site Alpha News.The 47-second-long video appears to have been taken by a phone held by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fired at the 37-year-old Good on Wednesday as she drove her SUV toward him on a residential street.The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familar with the investigation told MS Now.\"Ohhhh!\" the agent apparently moans, as the Honda Pilot lurches by him.\"F---ing bitch,\" the agent apparently mutters after firing at Good.Video still shows Renee Good moments before an ICE agent open fired and killed her.Source: Alpha NewsVice President JD Vance reposted the video on his X account.\"Watch this, as hard as it is,\" Vance wrote. \"Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.\"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and other Democrats have strongly disputed the claim by officials in the Trump administration that Good was trying to intentionally hit the ICE agent. Some observers have said Good, a mother of three, was trying to swerve around him after being approached by other ICE agents, who were directing her to get out of the SUV.CNBC has requested comment about the video from the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.The new video begins with the ICE agent exiting his car and walking over to Good's SUV, which is behind his, and blocking the road, as sirens blare in the background.The agent then walks over to the driver's door, where the video clearly shows Good's face through the open window.\"That's fine, dude, I'm not mad,\" Good tells him on the video. \"I'm not mad at any of you.\"There is a dog in the back of the SUV.Another woman, who was standing next to Good's car, says to the agent, \"Show your face, big boy, show your face.\"As the agent moves to the rear of Good's SUV to take video of its license plate, the other woman says, \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning.\"\"Just so you know. It'll be the same plate when you come talk to us later,\" the woman says, holding up her own phone with its camera lenses pointed at the agent. \"That's fine. U.S. citizen, former f---ing veteran, disabled veteran, you want to come at us? You want to come at us?\" the woman says. \"I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead,\" she says.At that point, another ICE agent approaches the driver's side of Good's SUV, saying, \"Out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the f---ing car. Get out of the car.\"The second woman walks over to Good's car as if to get into the front passenger seat, the video reveals.\"Drive baby, drive!\" the woman says to Good as she grabs the door handle.But the SUV backs up slightly and then moves forward.The agent fires within a second or two of that movement toward him.This is breaking news.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump in a social media post Thursday evening indirectly revealed data from Friday's market-moving nonfarm payrolls count, an apparent violation of long-standing federal policy on statistical releases.In a Truth Social post around 9 p.m. ET, the president indicated that private sector payrolls had expanded by 654,000 for the full year of 2025, a total that would have included Friday's jobs count for December. Office of Management and Budget policy prohibits executive branch officials from commenting on such releases early and in fact forbids public statements until 30 minutes after the release. Presidents can be briefed on official jobs figures ahead of the release.A White House official conceded, however, that \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information. The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.\"The official further chided the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy\" and instead urged a focus on how \"President Trump's policies are laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.\"The Trump post drew a distinction between private and government job growth, with the latter down 181,000 for 2025.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' December jobs report, posted by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social account, about 12 hours before the figures were publicly released, is seen in this screenshot obtained on January 9, 2026. @realdonaldtrump | Via ReutersFriday's jobs data release went on to show that nonfarm payrolls increased 50,000 for December, all but 2,000 of which came from the private sector. The figures, while slightly less than official economists' estimates, assuaged concerns about a steeper drop in employment. Stock futures trended higher following the data.While Trump's post would not allow traders to calculate the exact payrolls figure because of lack of data on revisions, they could have gleaned a rough estimation of the figure and possibly ruled out a December job-loss scenario that would have spooked markets.Trump once telegraphed somewhat a positive jobs figure in his first term, drawing criticism.",

    "body": "The Camp Jeep outdoor terrain at the New York International Auto Shown on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Stellantis is scrapping its plug-in hybrid electric Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivan amid slowing EV sales, quality issues and weakened federal fuel economy requirements. The automaker on Friday said the decision to end production of the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica was a result of waning customer demand and the need to focus on \"more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range‑extended vehicles.\"\"Stellantis continually evaluates its product strategy to meet evolving customer needs and regulatory requirements. With customer demand shifting, Stellantis will phase out plug‑in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year,\" the company said in an emailed statement.The decision is an about-face for the automaker, which has touted its U.S. sales leadership of the models for years. In 2024, then-Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa — who is now CEO of Stellantis — said the SUV brand planned to sell 160,000 to 170,000 PHEVs that year, and the company said it represented 41% of U.S. PHEV sales.watch nowAside from sales, Stellantis has been using PHEVs as a way to offset its production of gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs to attempt to meet federal fuel economy standards and avoid penalties. The goal has become less urgent as the Trump administration eliminates or weakens aspects of those rules. Chrysler first introduced its PHEV minivan in 2016. Jeep debuted the Wrangler PHEV, which it called a \"4xe,\" in 2020, followed by a Grand Cherokee version in 2021.PHEVs feature traditional internal combustion engines, but also have an all-electric range when charged like an EV. They have largely been viewed as a transitional technology from traditional vehicles to EVs; however, they are quite costly because of their two different propulsion systems. The cancellation also comes amid a recall of the Jeep SUVs due to fire risk — the latest in a string of issues for the vehicles. The company is also reevaluating its product portfolio as part of its U.S. turnaround strategy.A 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee.JeepThe company said the recall, which included a stop-sale of the vehicles, \"is in no way related\" to the cancellation of the vehicles. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf late last month told CNBC the brand was evaluating its electrification strategy since the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs and PHEVs in September.He said Jeep still had vehicles on the ground that it would continue to sell, but \"all of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out, and what becomes steady state for 4xe and [battery] EVs in general.\"A Jeep spokeswoman said the brand will continue to offer all-electric SUVs such as the Wagoneer S and Recon, which was officially revealed late last year.",

President Donald Trump earlier this week told Republicans to be \"flexible\" on Hyde, prompting some pushback from within the GOP ranks.\"We don't do federal funding for abortions,\" Moreno said. \"That's a long-standing tradition, nobody's looking to change that.\"CNN reported on Thursday that some GOP Senators were privately open to leaving the Hyde Amendment as is.The Thursday vote on the House floor came after four moderate Republicans broke ranks at the end of last year and signed on to a Democrat-led discharge petition to force a vote on the ACA subsidies.A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows members of the House to circumvent leadership and force a vote on the floor if a majority of lawmakers sign on.The discharge petition, introduced by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., cleared a procedural hurdle Wednesday, with nine Republicans joining all Democrats voting in favor of the measure, despite opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Eleven Republican voted with Democrats on a second procedural vote earlier Thursday.\"What we do here today will not be the end of the effort that is necessary, but we can begin the effort that is necessary and extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said on the House floor ahead of the final vote.",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court did not rule Friday on the legality of broad tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, leaving markets still awaiting a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on trade policy and the U.S. fiscal situation.There had been speculation that the tariff ruling would be issued on Friday, but the Supreme Court released just one opinion for the day, and it was unrelated to tariffs.It is unclear when the tariff ruling will be released. The court will release its next rulings Wednesday.When it does come, the decision will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

Carlos Barria | ReutersMeta on Friday announced agreements with three nuclear power providers, including one backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, as part of its efforts to secure necessary resources for its AI ambitions. The arrangements with Vistra, TerraPower and Oklo, which are all working on nuclear power technologies, are for Meta's Prometheus supercluster computing system that's being built at a data center in New Albany, Ohio. No financial terms were disclosed. Shares of Vistra and Oklo rocketed higher following the news, climbing 15% and 17%, respectively. Meta shares were flat.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Prometheus in July, describing the system as one of the keys to the development of the company's advanced artificial intelligence efforts. Meta has said it expects Prometheus to come online sometime in 2026. In working with the three companies on energy production, Meta said the projects should add 6.6 gigawatts of power by 2035, exceeding the total demand of New Hampshire.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOklo and Vistra one-day stock chart.\"State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America's position as a global leader in AI,\" Meta policy chief Joel Kaplan said in a statement. The company said it will help fund Vistra's nuclear power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, extending the lifespan of those facilities and increasing their energy production. The other two companies' nuclear projects are still being developed. Meta expects the agreements to create \"thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs.\"The deals mark the latest efforts by Meta to secure the energy needed to power its AI infrastructure as the company marches toward Zuckerberg's goal of developing superintelligence, a term used to describe AI that can greatly exceed the capabilities of humans on numerous tasks.Meta's megacap rivals are also looking to nuclear power to help fuel their AI work. Meta, Amazon and Google signed a pledge in March supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy production by 2050.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotsIn June, Meta announced a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy so it could purchase purchase nuclear power from the company's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois beginning in 2027.Meta's deal with TerraPower will provide funding for two of the energy company's nuclear projects that are under development and could begin generating power by 2032, according to Friday's announcement. Meta said it could obtain rights for more energy from up to six of TerraPower's other nuclear energy projects that are targeted for delivery by 2035. Meanwhile, Oklo's advanced nuclear technology campus is expected to come online as soon as 2030 in Pike County, Ohio, Meta said. OpenAI's Altman is one of Oklo's biggest investors, owning a 4.3% stake worth about $650 million as of Thursday's close, according to FactSet. Oklo went public in 2024 through a special purpose acquisition company that Altman co-founded. Altman stepped down as chairman of Oklo's board in April as a way to help the company secure more customers with companies that compete with OpenAI.WATCH: AI hardware trade dominates in 2025.watch now",

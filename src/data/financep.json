    "body": "watch nowImprovement in mortgage rates at the end of the summer boosted home sales, but that gain may be short-lived.Sales of previously owned homes in October rose 1.2% from September to 4.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were up 1.7% year over year. This count is based on home closings, so contracts likely signed in August and September. While contract signings would not be impacted by the government shutdown that started in October, closings, especially those requiring flood insurance or government-backed rural home loans, could be.During that contract-signing period, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage came down for a bit but then moved up again. The popular 30-year rate started August at 6.63%, fell steadily to 6.13% by mid-September, and then came back up to 6.37% by the end of the month, according to Mortgage News Daily. It now stands at 6.36%.The inventory of homes for sale has also come down. After gaining for much of this year, supply fell to 1.52 million units, down 0.7% from September, although still nearly 11% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.4-month supply, still considered lean.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.And that's why prices are still gaining. The median price of a home sold in October was $415,200, an increase of 2.1% from October 2024 and the 28th consecutive month of annual gains. \"Looking ahead, home shoppers in today's market face some advantages from falling mortgage rates and seasonally slower competition,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"At the same time, a lack of housing affordability continues to be a challenge keeping home sales in their historically low level.\"Homes are staying on the market longer, at an average of 34 days last month compared with 29 days last October. First-time buyers made a comeback in the market, representing 32% of sales, up from 27% a year ago — but not all regions are equal. \"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"Sales growth continues to be strongest on the high end of the market. Homes priced above $1 million saw sales up more than 16% from a year ago, and those priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw a gain of 10%. Meanwhile sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 were up just about 1%, and homes priced below $100,000 saw a drop in sales of nearly 3%. ",

South Florida Sun-sentinel | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury charged U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., with stealing $5 million in Covid-19 disaster funds — a chunk of which was then illegally contributed to her 2021 congressional campaign, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, tried to launder the money through multiple accounts to disguise its source, the DOJ said, citing the indictment issued in U.S. District Court in Miami.The siblings obtained the money in July 2021, after the family health-care company where they worked received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA, which funded the company's Covid vaccination staffing contract, according to the DOJ.Cherfilus-McCormick and another defendant, Nadege Leblanc, are also accused of orchestrating a \"straw donor\" scheme in which money from the FEMA contract was sent to friends and relatives, who then donated it back to her campaign for Congress.Cherfilus-McCormick joined the House in 2022 after winning a special election that January to fill late Rep. Alcee Hastings' seat representing Florida's 20th Congressional District.The congresswoman and her 2021 tax preparer, David Spencer, are also charged in the indictment with conspiring to file a false tax return, the DOJ said. They claimed personal and political expenses as business deductions and \"inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations,\" the indictment alleges.Cherfilus-McCormick faces a possible maximum sentence of 53 years in prison if convicted, the DOJ said in a press release. Actual sentences are often significantly lower than the maximums due to judges' discretion and federal sentencing guidelines.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

The cybersecurity provider is also in the process of buying Israeli identity security firm CyberArk for $25 billion under CEO Nikesh Arora's acquisition spree.He told investors in an earnings call that Palo Alto is making this simultaneous acquisition to address the fast-moving AI cycle.\"This large surge towards building AI compute is causing a lot of the AI players to think about newer models for software stacks and infrastructure stacks in the future,\" he said. Palo Alto guided for revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.59 billion in the second quarter, the midpoint of which was in line with a $2.58 billion estimate. For the full year, the company expects $10.50 billion to $10.54 billion, versus a $10.51 billion estimate. Capital expenditures during the period were much higher than expectations at $84 million.

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (L), and Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia.ReutersTwo months ago Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stood side by side in San Jose, California, to announce a historic agreement between the two leaders in artificial intelligence. Nvidia would invest $100 billion over a number of years, starting in 2026, as OpenAI's AI supercomputing facilities come online, the duo said. The timing of the buildouts and the cost of each data center weren't disclosed. But in Nvidia's quarterly financial report on Wednesday, the chipmaker reminded investors that there's a big difference between an announcement and a contract. \"There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms,\" Nvidia said in the risk factors section of its quarterly filing.Nvidia has been on an investing binge of late, putting its ever-expanding cash hoard to use, and financially supporting companies that buy its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In addition to the OpenAI arrangement, Nvidia on Wednesday highlighted its $5 billion commitment to invest in Intel during the quarter and its agreement this week to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic.An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment but pointed to Huang's statements on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"\"There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all,\" Nvidia said. The key difference with OpenAI is the scale of the planned investment and the benchmarks that would need to be met for all the money to come through. A source told CNBC at the time of the announcement that an initial $10 billion would be available to OpenAI soon to help the company work towards deploying its first gigawatt of capacity.Altman said recently that OpenAI will end the year on a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate, which is a massive number considering its flagship ChatGPT product is only three years old. Altman said the company expects to reach hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by 2030. But that figure doesn't come anywhere close to covering the company's expenses. In total, OpenAI has announced roughly $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending with a number of partners as it seeks to continue building out its AI models and services. To get there, the company is reliant on outside capital. Despite the uncertainty of the September agreement, Nvidia executives continue to sound bullish on the company's work with OpenAI. On Nvidia's earnings call, after the chipmaker reported a solid revenue and earnings beat along with stronger-than-expected guidance, CFO Colette Kress touted OpenAI's growth.\"OpenAI recently shared that their weekly user base has grown to 800 million, enterprise customers has increased to 1 million and that their gross margins were healthy,\" Kress said. She added that the two companies are \"working on a strategic partnership\" and that Nvidia is \"focused on helping them build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers.\"And Huang said, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment, but pointed to Huang's commentary on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"There's no question that as OpenAI builds out data centers, it will keep spending money on Nvidia's chips. But OpenAI has also partnered with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices, agreeing last month to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, beginning in the second half of next year. The AMD agreement has one critical component that Nvidia's lacks: signatures. As part of the pact, the company has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock, with vesting milestones tied to deployment volume and AMD's share price. That agreement was signed on Oct. 5, by AMD CFO Jean Hu and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar. — CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOdds of a December rate cut remained low following the release of delayed jobs data. Markets were last pricing about a 35% chance of a quarter-point cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.The target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.   Those expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. However, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it's been since October 2021. \"All those numbers suggest an economy that's still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other,\" Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don't think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other.\" To be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight. \"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate,\" wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Weak hard data and close-to-target inflation look set to drive policy going forward, despite recent hawkish noises.\" \"The setup is in place for Powell to continue his risk-management approach to the labor market before his term as Chair expires in May,\" Haigh continued.

    "body": "watch nowNvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter.Wall Street welcomed the report, and Nvidia stock rose after the release and during the conference call. Other stocks in the so-called artificial intelligence trade also saw a boost.A closer look at Nvidia's report shows that it continues to dominate the market for AI chips called GPUs, and CEO Jensen Huang sounded confident in the company's products and bullish on the company's outlook during a call with analysts. Nvidia said it expects about $65 billion in sales in the current quarter, which ends in late January. That would be 65% growth on an annual basis. Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's earnings:Nvidia rejects bubble talkOn Wednesday's earnings call with analysts, Huang began his comments by rejecting the premise of an \"AI bubble\" held by some investors who are concerned about the billions of dollars being spent on Nvidia chips and potential return on investment. \"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Huang said. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Huang said there were three different kinds of uses for AI that are currently growing, and that all three are contributing to the boom in infrastructure investments.He said that non-AI software, like for data processing, was increasingly being run on the company's GPUs, that AI will create new kinds of apps, and that \"agentic AI\" which doesn't need user input, will require additional computing power. Huang said that people will soon start appreciating what's happening underneath the surface of the AI boom, versus \"the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx and investment.\"Bernstein analysts said in a note that Huang's comments helped settle investor fears of a bubble after a recent pullback in AI names, saying \"perhaps the AI trade is not yet dead after all.\"\"More than just good numbers, we believe investors needed some hand-holding from Jensen which he provided in spades,\" the analysts wrote.'Half a trillion' forecast is on trackLast month, Huang said at a conference in Washington, DC, that his company had orders for $500 billion in AI chips in 2025 and 2026.On Wednesday, the company said that the forecast was still on track. Any long-term outlook from Nvidia is important to the technology industry because Nvidia counts many of the most powerful technology customers as customers. Nvidia said on Wednesday that its order backlog didn't even include a few recent announcements, like the company's deal with Anthropic or the expansion of a deal with Saudi Arabia this week. \"The number will grow,\" CFO Colette Kress said on the call, saying the company was on track to hit the forecast. \"We'll probably be taking more orders.\"\"We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time,\" Huang said. Several analyst notes on Thursday drew attention to the $500 billion forecast and the addition of the recently announced deals.Jefferies said Nvidia \"answered the bell\" in its earnings report and said the numbers should help steady the AI trade into the end of the year.\"We don't expect every AI bear to be satisfied, but these results and added context from management around demand outlook should offer some near-term reprieve,\" the analysts wrote.\"Insignificant\" China ordersNvidia fought over the summer to gain licenses to export its H20 chip, a slowed-down version of 2022 technology, to China. Some analysts projected the China business could be worth $50 billion per year to Nvidia. The company eventually got the licenses this summer after Huang personally met with President Donald Trump and struck a deal to give the U.S. government 15% of China sales. But it turns out that the sales of H20 chips during the quarter was \"insignificant.\" Kress told analysts that the company recorded $50 million in H20 sales during the period. \"Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,\" Kress said. Nvidia has argued that the U.S. government should allow exports of the most advanced chips because it's better for national security if Chinese developers get used to Nvidia technology, rather than being forced to use Chinese chips and make them better.The H20 is old technology, but Nvidia wants to gain approval to send a version of its current-generation Blackwell chip in China. \"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said.Analysts at Melius said Thursday that the lack of China sales made the numbers \"all the more extraordinary\" and projected Nvidia would generate nearly $400 billion in free cash flow over the next nine quarters.\"Currently Nvidia isn't delivering to China and we are not counting on this situation to get straightened out,\" the firm said.Read more CNBC tech newsAnthropic valued in range of $350 billion following investment deal with Microsoft, NvidiaZoox begins offering robotaxi rides in San Francisco, facing off with WaymoGoogle announces Gemini 3 as battle with OpenAI intensifiesCloudflare blames 'unusual' spike in traffic before massive outage CNBC's Sam Subin contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Starbucks workers walk a picket line as they go on strike outside a Starbucks store on Nov. 13, 2025 in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesOne week into what baristas have threatened to make the \"largest, longest\" strike in Starbucks' history, the Workers United union said it is adding more than two dozen new cities and stores to its strike count. The union said Thursday it will now be striking at 95 stores in 65 cities, with some 2,000 baristas now engaged in the action. On Wednesday, baristas and allies also picketed and held a rally outside of the company's distribution center in York, Pa. Starbucks said there were no disruptions to its operations in York.Workers United said the majority of stores where strikes were held had to close down on the first day of the strike due to staffing issues, and the lack of workers impacted some 50 locations in the days to follow. Starbucks said stores that had issues were often able to reopen quickly and that less than 1% of its locations are experiencing disruption from the strike.The strike has so far not appeared to dent foot traffic and sales, according to the company and data from Placer.ai. The location intelligence tracking firm's data show foot traffic on Red Cup Day, when the strike was launched, was up 44.5% compared to the daily average between Jan. 1 and Nov. 14 this year.In a memo to workers last week, CEO Brian Niccol touted the success of the holiday launch so far. \"Together, we set new records. Last Thursday's Holiday launch was our biggest sales day ever in North America. Then yesterday, we had our strongest Reusable Red Cup day in company history,\" the memo sent Friday said. The union began organizing at Starbucks in 2021 and says it now represents more than 11,000 workers across more than 550 stores. This week, it said five non-union stores filed for union elections, including locations in the Baltimore, Md. area, Harrisonburg, Va., and Little Rock, Ark. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers. Workers United is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.The strike has threatened to hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.Starbucks maintains it will be ready to serve customers across its stores this holiday season.\"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement regarding the strike escalation.\"Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" Anderson said. \"The facts are clear, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging $30 per hour for hourly partners. People choose to work here and stay here—our turnover is less than half the industry average, and we receive more than a million job applications every year.\"watch now",

    "body": "Waymo driverless vehicles charge at a Waymo charging station in Santa Monica, California, U.S., May 30, 2025. Daniel Cole | ReutersAlphabet's Waymo on Thursday announced that it will soon begin manually driving its robotaxi vehicles in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The Google sister company will start operating test drives in that trio of towns with human drivers in hopes of launching its driverless robotaxi service there as soon as next year, the company said. If Waymo does begin operating in those markets next year, that would bring the robotaxi company's list of 2026 planned expansions to 15 cities. On Tuesday, Waymo said it plans to start operating its vehicles with no human driver in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Miami and Orlando in the coming weeks, with plans to open service to the public there next year. The company has also previously announced plans to expand to Detroit, Denver, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and London in 2026.A spokesperson said Waymo will wait until its technology is validated in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans before committing to 2026 service launches.\"2026 is very much on the table, but we'll be led by our safety framework,\" Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in an email. With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company has provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020. Last week, Waymo began offering freeway routes in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets. The company said it will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.The addition of freeway rides marked an important milestone for Waymo and the robotaxi industry due to the challenges conditions of operating at such high speeds. Next year, Waymo will set its sights on achieving another key milestone: operating in markets known for harsh winter conditions.Along with Denver and Detroit, the addition of Minneapolis means Waymo believes its nearly ready to begin serving riders in regions where its driverless vehicles would need to be ready to brave snow and frigid forecasts. \"We currently operate at freezing temperatures, including with frost and hail, and we're validating our system to navigate harsher weather conditions,\" Teicher said. \"We'll have small fleets to start that we expand over time.\"This week, Amazon-owned Zoox began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles. San Francisco is the second market where Zoox now offers a free service, after its launch in Las Vegas in September. The company plans to remove its rider waitlist for San Francisco entirely in 2026.WATCH: Waymo launches paid robotaxi rides on freewayswatch now",

Brian Rothmuller | Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesMajor League Baseball officially announced a new three-year media rights agreement with NBC, Netflix and ESPN on Wednesday, foreshadowing the league's more significant TV deal to come in 2028.The new deal stems from ESPN's decision to opt out of its \"Sunday Night Baseball\" package earlier this year. ESPN struck a new deal with MLB, acquiring the rights to MLB.TV and a midweek game package. NBC Sports will take over the Sunday Night games, and Netflix will be the new home for the next three Home Run Derbies. All the deals begin with the 2026 season.CNBC previously reported most of the details of the agreement in August.\"Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,\" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The new deal foreshadows MLB's quest to raise TV revenue at the end of the 2028 season, when it will get these rights back plus existing broadcast rights from Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, MLB had to take a haircut of about $300 million per year relative to what ESPN had been paying before opting out earlier this year. NBC is paying about $200 million a year for its new package, and Netflix is paying about $50 million annually for the Derby, CNBC reported in August. The two packages, together, roughly make up what ESPN had been paying for.Even so, MLB has a chance to expand its reach through the new and streaming-exclusive partners.The average ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game averaged 1.8 million viewers this past season.The loss in revenue for the Sunday Night package suggests MLB may have to get creative with the way it carves up new packages of games in 2028 to ensure it continues to grow media revenue. In aggregate, the league is now making more in overall media revenue, but it needed to sell ESPN rights and games it hadn't previously offered. ESPN is paying about $550 million for its new package, CNBC reported in August.The NBA nearly tripled its national media revenue in its most recent rights deal, and the NFL is so confident it can generate a huge increase on the deal it signed in 2021 that it's open to accelerating talks with its current media partners as early as next year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in September.New deal detailsESPN's new deal allows it sell and distribute MLB.TV, the league's out of market streaming service, through the ESPN app. ESPN will also receive a new 30-game midweek package of live games on ESPN's linear networks and the ESPN app. ESPN also will sell and distribute MLB Network and in-market games for select MLB teams via the ESPN app. Those teams are the Cleveland Guardians, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies — franchises whose games have been produced and distributed by MLB after the collapse of regional sports networks that carried those teams.NBC will now have MLB, NBA and NFL on Sunday for its broadcast network, its new cable sports channel, and its Peacock streaming service. NBC will also carry MLB's entire Wild Card round, ranging from eight to 12 games each season. In addition to three years of the Home Run Derby, Netflix will own the rights to a singular game on Opening Night for the next three seasons. Netflix will also exclusively deliver all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",

The Dow Jones consensus estimate for September was 50,000. The July total also was revised down to 72,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the prior release.In addition to the headline jobs number, the BLS said the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.4%, the highest it's been since October 2021. A broader measure that includes those not looking for jobs or working part-time for economic reasons edged lower to 8%.Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% for the month and 3.8% from a year ago, compared to respective forecasts for 0.3% and 3.7%.The report ends a data drought on the labor market that began in early September and continued through the record 44-day government shutdown. Agencies including the BLS, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and others were prohibited from collecting or releasing data during the period.This was the first BLS jobs report since the count for August that was released Sept. 5. It also was the second since Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1, following a July jobs report that contained massive revisions for prior months.\"September's jobs report shows the labor market still had resilience before the shutdown, beating payroll expectations, but the picture remains muddy with August jobs revised to a job loss and the unemployment rate increasing,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"These numbers are a snapshot from two months ago and they don't reflect where we stand now in November.\"A 'Now Hiring' sign sits outside the entrance to a Burlington department store on Nov. 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesStock market futures nevertheless added to gains following the report while Treasury yields were mostly lower.

Hawkish talk out of the October Fed meeting, as reflected in minutes released Wednesday, contributed to a general feeling that the central bank will be on hold into the end of the year.\"Despite the fact that today's jobs report is very backward looking, it's making markets move,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Equities like the fact that payrolls were stronger than expected, suggesting the economy is still on a firm footing, while the bond market likes the rise in unemployment and slowdown in wage growth which may keep the case for a December Fed cut just about alive.\"Overall, the report shows the labor market entered the autumn months on much the same footing it has been all year – a slow but steady pace, with firms reluctant both to hire many new workers or lay off existing workforce during a time of unusual economic volatility spurred by aggressive policy actions in President Donald Trump's White House.A separate Labor Department release Thursday showed that initial jobless claims totaled 220,000 for the week ending Nov. 15, down 8,000 from the prior period and lower than the consensus forecast for 227,000.Job gains in September came from familiar sources, with health care leading at 43,000, about right on target with its pace over the past year. Bars and restaurants contributed 37,000 while social assistance added 14,000. On the downside, transportation and warehousing lost 25,000 and federal government, which had been a large contributor to employment growth, was off 3,000, part of a loss of 97,000 on the calendar year. Professional and business services also reported a decline of 20,000, fueled by a drop of 16,000 in temporary help. The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, painted an even brighter picture of the labor market.The total level of those employed rose by 251,000 while the labor force increased by 470,000 to a fresh record of 171.2 million. The participation rate, which measures the share of the working-age population either working or seeking employment, edged higher to 62.4, the highest since May.The rolls of full-time employment swelled by 673,000 while part-times fell by 573,000.The lack of comprehensive indicators has presented a challenge for Fed officials, who cut their benchmark interest rate in both September and October but face a tougher decision in December. Officials at the October meeting noted the difficulty in navigating policy without the usual array of economic metrics to rely on, and there was a significant inclination to forgo a December cut, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday.With September's payrolls count released, the BLS is preparing the first influx of other data in coming months. The bureau on Wednesday announced it will release jobs data for October and November simultaneously on Dec. 16. October's numbers will not include the customary unemployment rate calculation as that comes from a survey of households that will not be able to be completed because of the shutdown.",

    "body": "A shopper pushes a cart outside a Walmart store in San Leandro, California, US, on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWalmart raised its sales and earnings outlook Thursday as the retailer posted revenue gains in its fiscal third quarter, driven by double-digit e-commerce growth and new customers across incomes.The retailer said it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%. It said it expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from its prior range of $2.52 to $2.62.It marked the second quarter in a row Walmart hiked its full-year forecast. Walmart's earnings report is the first since the Arkansas-based company announced a leadership change. The big-box retailer said last week that John Furner, the CEO of its U.S. business, will succeed longtime CEO Doug McMillon on Feb. 1.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said consumer habits didn't change during the quarter, as shoppers spent selectively and looked for deals. He said Walmart has gained those \"value-seeking\" customers across incomes, both because of the economic backdrop and its own strategic moves.\"Consumers are looking to do business with those companies that are providing value, that are delivering the convenience that they've come to know and expect, and that are executing consistently well,\" he said.watch nowHe said Walmart saw an impact from the pause in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, formerly known as food stamps, during the prolonged government shutdown. But he said \"that's starting to rebound now that people are receiving those funds again.\"Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents adjusted vs. 60 cents expectedRevenue: $179.50 billion vs. $177.43 billion expectedWalmart also said Thursday that it will transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq and will begin trading there on Dec. 9. It is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It will have the same stock ticker symbol, \"WMT.\"The company's stock was up about 4% premarket trading Thursday. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Walmart are up about 11% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's nearly 13% gains during the same period. Read moreAs a retail giant that draws shoppers across incomes, Walmart is closely watched as an indication of the health of the U.S. consumer and how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting the prices shoppers pay. It can speak to consumer behavior across categories, since it sells discretionary items like makeup and clothes along with necessities like milk and toilet paper.Walmart has gained more high-income customers as even affluent households sought relief from pricier grocery bills due to high inflation in recent years. That cohort also has responded to store remodels and faster deliveries. That growth continued in the most recent quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He said Walmart has gained market share across incomes, but \"they're more pronounced in the upper-income segment.\"Some of those shoppers have come to Walmart for speed, Rainey said. The retailer can now deliver to about 95% of U.S. households from stores in under three hours.Customers now expedite about a third of its online orders from stores to arrive in one- or three-hour timeframes, he said. He said revenue related to those faster deliveries has increased 70% year over year. The company charges a fee for some speedier orders, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.The expedited delivery service is popular, even with shoppers with lower incomes, he said. During the weeks of November when SNAP benefits were paused, Rainey said Walmart noticed a dip in that volume.In the three-month period that ended Oct. 31, Walmart's net income increased to $6.14 billion, or 77 cents per share, from $4.58 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items, such as business reorganization charges, Walmart's adjusted earnings per share was 62 cents.Revenue rose from $169.59 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the third quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period. That surpassed analysts' expectations of 4% growth, according to StreetAccount. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.At Sam's Club, comparable sales rose 3.8%, excluding fuel. Walmart e-commerce sales grew by 27% globally, as all segments of the company posted sharp gains. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 28%, driven by increases in store-fulfilled delivery of online orders and growth of advertising and its third-party marketplace.E-commerce sales internationally jumped 26% and at Sam's Club in the U.S., they rose 22%.In the U.S., shoppers made more trips to Walmart and spent more on those visits. Customer transactions rose 1.8% and average ticket increased by 2.7%.As Walmart gains more digital traffic and adds more products to its third-party marketplace, advertising has been a meaningful growth area, too. In the quarter, its global advertising business increased by 53%, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired last year for $2.3 billion. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew 33% year over year. Walmart is mulling another acquisition after it expanded its third-party marketplace rapidly in recent years, as it is in talks to buy R&A Data, a startup that works to curb scams and counterfeits, CNBC reported Wednesday.Like other retailers, Walmart has said it raised prices on some items to offset higher costs from tariffs. About a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey told CNBC in May.On a call with CNBC on Thursday, Rainey said when it comes to higher tariff costs, \"the pressure is real.\" Yet, he said Walmart's team has been able to reduce the impact on customers by finding ways to absorb some costs.Furner, Walmart's incoming CEO who currently leads the retailer's U.S. business, said on the earnings call that there's been some relief on key food categories, which is helping offset tariff cost pressures. Earlier this month, Trump exempted some major agricultural imports, including cocoa, bananas and coffee, from increased duties as he faced backlash over high prices.Plus, Furner said the big-box retailer's wider assortment has helped the company find a balance as it increases prices on some items and lowers them on others. It's also adjusted its merchandise orders to reduce the risk of markdowns. For example, it's kept a larger inventory of items for kids, since people tend to prioritize their families even when they feel financial pressure, he said.Walmart's gains in non-food categories, which tend to be higher margin, have also helped. Sales of fashion, the more trend-driven category of its apparel segment, grew more than 5% in the quarter compared to the year-ago period, he said.Walmart's results on Thursday followed cautious updates from Target, Home Depot and Lowe's. All three of those retailers lowered their full-year profit outlooks this week and referred to consumers who were hesitant to make big purchases and hungry for deals. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent company TJX, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast, saying it's seeing a \"strong start\" to the holidays as it caters to value-conscious shoppers.Rainey said Walmart is \"going into the holiday pretty optimistic,\" saying it's prepared with competitive price points.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday night said he signed a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post followed the bill's near-unanimous passage in Congress.\"I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" Trump wrote in the 390-word post, which painted the notorious financier as a \"lifelong Democrat\" who \"was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures.\"Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, also stressed that he had asked Republican leaders in the House and Senate to pass the bill — even though his administration had reportedly opposed the push to release the files. After the vote on the bill was scheduled in the House, Trump on Sunday night abruptly urged Republicans to back it.\"Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage,\" Trump wrote Wednesday night.The bill instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified records relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, among other information, within 30 days of its signing. But the legislation contains exceptions, including for information containing victims' personally identifiable information or child sex abuse materials.It also includes a carve-out for records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\" Bondi, acquiescing to a request from Trump, said last week that she had assigned Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's ties to several of the president's perceived foes.The legislation received overwhelming support in the House, with all but one lawmaker, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, voting for it on Tuesday.It passed immediately when it was sent to the Senate on Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had secured a unanimous consent agreement, which allowed the legislation to sail through the upper chamber as soon as it was received.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDespite his sudden shift in stance on the bill, Trump has continued to fume about the focus on Epstein, calling it a \"hoax\" being pushed by Democrats to distract from his administration's achievements. He has repeatedly lashed out at reporters when asked about his connections to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Trump and Epstein were friends until the early 2000s, but the two had a falling out years before Epstein's death.When an ABC News reporter asked Trump on Tuesday why he has not released the Epstein files on his own — as he has the power to do — the president insulted her and called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump on the 2024 campaign trail suggested he would release files related to Epstein. In the early months of his second term, officials in his administration signaled they were pushing to disclose those files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February, for instance, that Epstein's rumored \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" The same month, a group of pro-Trump influencers received binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" at the White House.But those binders contained little new information. And the DOJ, in an unsigned memo in July, said that a review of its Epstein-related materials \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\" The memo also included the agency's conclusion that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"The announcement enraged both Democrats and some prominent voices in Trump's base. In subsequent months, scrutiny increased over Trump's past association with Epstein.In July, The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a \"bawdy\" and cryptic note to Epstein bearing Trump's signature, which was part of a collection of letters gathered for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents it had obtained from Epstein's estate through a subpoena, including emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email thread in 2018, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"I know how dirty donald is.\" In an April 2019 email to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" CNBC has not independently verified the emails, and it is unclear what Epstein was referring to.House Democrats and a handful of Republicans sought to approve a discharge petition that would force a vote in the GOP-majority chamber on the bill to release the Epstein files. That effort was delayed for weeks by the government shutdown, which postponed the swearing-in of a Democratic lawmaker who would provide the last needed signature.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

    "body": "Signage for SGX Group at the Singapore Exchange Ltd. stock exchange headquarters in Singapore, on Monday, July 14, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSingapore is doubling down on its efforts to make the city-state's stock market more attractive for companies and investors. The country's bourse has tied up with the Nasdaq to simplify dual listings in the U.S. and Singapore, introducing a \"Global Listing Board\" for companies with a market capitalization of more than 2 billion Singapore dollars (about $1.5 billion). The \"Landmark partnership\" is aimed at enabling firms to \"access global capital, investors and liquidity through a harmonized cross-border listing framework that bridges the two markets,\" according to a statement released by the Nasdaq and the Singapore Exchange late Wednesday.A key feature, the SGX said, would be the streamlining of regulatory obligations and fundraising with a single set of documents and simplified review process by mid-2026. So effectively, the companies will only need to fill a single set of paperwork fulfilling the regulations on both exchanges.Speaking to CNBC's Martin Soong, SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said that this benefits investors, because it's a dual listing across different time zones. \"You get to have price discovery almost round the clock ... given where volatility is today, this allows investors to risk manage 24 hours, and you're also giving choices to investors, whether that could be US dollars or that could be in Sing dollars.\"Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, told CNBC that this dual listing bridge was the \"first of its kind,\" and added that it was \"something that's very exciting for companies that have an Asian footprint, want to have global exposure and have a singular regulatory experience.\"The step aligns with the broader efforts by the Singapore government to strengthen the attractiveness of Singapore's stock market to investors and companies seeking to list and access growth capital, SGX said.Stepping up The announcement also come as the Monetary Authority of Singapore revealed more measures to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore's stock market. These include a SG$30 million \"Value Unlock\" package to help companies develop abilities in corporate strategy, capital optimization, and investor relations. \"It is an opportune time for companies to reinforce strategic fundamentals, enhance communications, and demonstrate value creation to attract and sustain investor participation,\" MAS said. The central bank also announced placing SG$2.85 billion with six asset managers in Singapore, adding on to its SG$1.1 billion allocation in July this year, aimed at developing Singapore's fund management industry and increasing investor participation in Singapore equities.CGS International analysts Lock Mun Yee and Lim Siew Kee said in a note that the liquidity boost is a positive for the Singapore stock market and new measures such the \"Value Unlock\" program are complementary to the value chain.The MAS said that it had seen \"increasing\" activity and interest in Singapore's equity market, with average daily turnover in the third quarter of 2025 climbing 16% year on year to SG$1.53 billion — the highest since the first quarter of 2021. In particular, trading activity in small- and mid-cap stocks has picked up. IPOs have also gained pace, raising over SG$2 billion so far this year. CGS International cautioned that while a potential dual listing in Singapore could broaden regional investor access, factors such as the SGX's relatively lower liquidity compared to the Nasdaq remain near-term hurdles. Analysts from Goldman Sachs said that the guidelines and enforcement details of the \"Value Unlock\" program are currently limited, adding that recent investor engagements suggest that corporate action would be required for a further re-rating of the Singapore market. Goldman pointed to Japan and South Korea that have implemented measures such as dividend tax cuts and disclosure guidelines to drive corporate action. Singapore's STI is up about 30% since the equities review group was established in August 2024, compared to the near 60% increase in Japan and South Korea's equity markets after the announcement of their respective reform measures, Goldman said.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

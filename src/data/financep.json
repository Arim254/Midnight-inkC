    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Most people have a relatively consistent wakeup time. Fewer have a set bedtime, which could be the reason you feel lacking in free time during the day, says author and time management expert Laura Vanderkam.The logic works like this: Without consistent sleep habits, most people can be generally productive but struggle to stay consistently focused all day, every day. Without consistent focus, your task list can build up, leading you to frantically rush to get things done. And when you're rushing, you make mistakes. Now the time you intended on saving is being spent backtracking or playing catch up.\"The problem is that people will get enough sleep over the course of a week overall, but it's very disordered,\" says Vanderkam, who's written eight books about time management. \"One night, you're staying up too late and getting up too early in the morning. The next night, somebody's crashing on the couch ... and weekends are all over the map.\"In spring 2021, Vanderkam surveyed over 150 participants who spent nine weeks implementing nine preset rules for productivity, including sticking to a consistent bedtime. \"One of the people in my study called [setting a bedtime] the least sexy, but the most impactful rule of all of them,\" says Vanderkam. A July 2025 study published to Nature, a peer-reviewed medical journal, came to a similar conclusion. Researchers observed over 79,000 working adults in Japan and found that irregular bedtimes were linked to lower productivity and more disengagement at work. A bedtime \"gives shape to the entire day,\" Vanderkam says, adding that it helps you know how many hours you have to work with each day, which helps you schedule your time more effectively. \"We know the day has a beginning — people are a lot fuzzier on this notion that each day has an end, but it does. And everything you're going to do has to fit within that time. It's kind of a puzzle.\"Vanderkam set an 11 p.m. bedtime for herself years ago, and says the routine \"allows me to make more rational choices about what is actually going to fit in my day.\"Disordered sleep can also negatively impact your circadian rhythm, or your body's innate sleep-wake pattern, Rachel Salas, a sleep neurologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC Make It in July 2022. To find yours, observe what time your body naturally wakes up without an alarm for a few days, and make 30-minute adjustments if you need to, Salas recommended.\"Sleep is a basic human need, and a lot is at stake if we don't get enough of it: our cognition, our memory, our digestion,\" said Salas. \"I can't think of one thing sleep isn't important for.\"Most adults need around seven hours of sleep per night, according to the Mayo Clinic, but sleep experts typically say that each person tends to need a different amount. Once you determine how much sleep helps you feel mentally sharp each day, use that figure to reverse-engineer your ideal bedtime, Vanderkam advises.\"Look at what time you have to wake up, count back the number of hours that you need to sleep, and we have a bedtime,\" says Vanderkam. Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

(Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images)Prakash Singh | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's trade negotiators will reschedule their planned visit to Washington, D.C., aimed at firming up an interim trade deal with the U.S., a person familiar with the development told CNBC.The development comes after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs as illegal on Friday. Within hours, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to first impose a 10% global import tariff, before increasing that to 15%.The \"meeting will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient date,\" the source told CNBC Sunday. India and the U.S. are of the view that the visit \"be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications.\"CNBC has reached out to India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a comment.India's chief negotiator, Darpan Jain, and his team were scheduled to start the three day-meeting in the U.S. later this week.India is currently facing a 25% reciprocal tariff, which was due to be cut to 18% after the two sides agreed to an interim deal earlier this month, with room for alterations.\"In the event of any changes to the agreed-upon tariffs of either country, the United States and India agree that the other country may modify its commitments,\" read the joint statement issued on Feb. 6, by the U.S. and India.At this stage, it appears that India, like other countries, will be facing a 15% tariff in addition to the most-favored-nation status rates (usually around 2-3%), said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative and a former Indian trade negotiator.Rethinking strategySince the Feb. 6 announcement, both sides had been meeting virtually to discuss the path forward, according to a local media report. The in-person meetings, planned for this coming week, with the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, were seen as the precursor to the finalization of the legal text of the agreement between India and the U.S.India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said Friday that the interim trade agreement between the two nations would likely be signed in March and implemented in April.\"The 18% tariff negotiations were based on a certain premise of some benefits which is now gone. Now, both sides have to rethink their strategy, and the U.S. has to deal with more pressing issues,\" Srivastava said.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesInvestors have been grappling with volatility amid fears of artificial intelligence disruption in a range of sectors, but attractive opportunities abound if they can look beneath the surface.Ignoring the ongoing noise, investors with a long-term horizon can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who take several aspects into account and conduct in-depth research before assigning a buy rating to a stock.  Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.DatadogArtificial intelligence-powered observability and security platform Datadog (DDOG) is this week's first pick. Following the company's Investor Day event on Feb. 12, Baird analyst William Power reiterated a buy rating on Datadog stock with a price target of $180. The analyst stated that while Datadog didn't provide any new long-term forecasts at the event, it continues to target an adjusted operating margin of over 25%, reflecting a balanced approach between investing for future growth and near-term profitability. Power noted solid demand for Datadog's existing products and growing opportunities in AI, logs, developer tools and security. He added that given Datadog's notable advantage in contextual data compared to rivals, the company is well-positioned to help enterprises as AI is increasing complexity within IT stacks. The five-star analyst believes that Datadog has the ability to address enterprises' security needs, supported by its broad observability platform and significant data insights. Power highlighted that while the company currently has about 8,500 security customers, including 70% of customers with over $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), security makes up only 2% of total ARR from these large customers, reflecting that vast expansion opportunity.\"We remain positive on the company's leadership position in the observability market, the continued success of its land and expand motion, and long-term opportunities across new products (especially security),\" said Power. Power ranks No. 459 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 55% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.8%. See Datadog Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Vertiv HoldingsAI infrastructure company Vertiv Holdings (VRT) provides power and cooling solutions to data centers. VRT recently rallied after reporting upbeat results for the fourth quarter of 2025, with organic orders surging 252%. Citing solid order growth and insights from Vertiv's 10-K filing, Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reiterated a buy rating on VRT stock and raised his price target to $277 from $250. Obin highlighted that the company expects the strong momentum in its orders to continue in 2026. \"To grow on top of 2025's $17.8bn in orders (+81% y/y organic) would be an impressive feat,\" said the analyst. He noted CEO Giordano Albertazzi's commentary that the pipeline was not depleted even after many large orders in the fourth quarter of 2025. Obin expects Vertiv's 2026 orders to grow by 5% to $18.6 billion. The analyst explained that even this modest year-over-year growth will result in significantly favorable backlog statistics. Specifically, a 5% order growth would add $5 billion to backlog (up 33% year over year). For Q1 2026, Obin projects $4.3 billion of orders (+52% year-over-year organic growth).Among the key takeaways from the 10-K filing, Obin highlighted that aside from tariff and economic uncertainty, AI, and thermal product expansion, Vertiv mentioned three new trends: strengthening services capabilities, strategic deals with Nvidia (NVDA) and Caterpillar (CAT), and prefabricated product development.Obin ranks No. 87 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 70% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Vertiv Holdings Statistics on TipRanks. Arista NetworksFinally, we look at Arista Networks (ANET), which provides networking solutions to large AI and data center environments. The company impressed investors with market-beating Q4 results and issued strong guidance. Following the decline in ANET stock in reaction to the announcement that Nvidia will supply Meta Platforms (META) GPUs, CPUs, and networking solutions, Needham analyst Ryan Koontz said that he expects the deal to have \"little to no impact\" on Arista's solid supplier position with Meta. Koontz reiterated a buy rating on ANET stock with a price target of $185. It is worth noting that the analyst had recently raised his price target for Arista stock to $185 from $165. Koontz highlighted that the Meta Platforms-Nvidia deal sparked concerns as Arista is a major networking supplier to the social media company. The analyst estimates that Meta accounted for 16% of Arista's 2025 revenue. Based on several industry checks following the deal's announcement, Koontz continues to view ANET as a \"dominant\" supplier to Meta Platforms for its AI back-end spine and scale-across applications. \"Our checks indicate that the bulk of NVDA networking sales to Meta have been and will continue to be NICs [network interface cards] that bridge NVDA xPUs to a first layer of Spectrum-X switches, which are backed by the ANET spine and scale-across networks,\" noted Koontz. The five-star analyst added that the announcement doesn't reflect anything notably new in networking, and is in fact a follow-up to a similar announcement in October 2025 from the Open Compute Project (OCP) conference, when Nvidia announced that Meta would deploy Spectrum-X. Koontz ranks No. 277 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 51% of the time, delivering an average return of 24.7%. See Arista Networks Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "description": "More companies are leaning into \"peanut butter\" pay increases this year, according to Payscale's Pay Increase Preview Report.The term refers to across",
    "body": "More companies are leaning into \"peanut butter\" pay increases this year, according to Payscale's Pay Increase Preview Report.The term refers to across-the board raises \"that are even and spread thinly, like peanut butter would be on a sandwich,\" according to career coach Colleen Paulson.About half — 48% — of surveyed organizations said that they will continue giving out pay increases based on performance, according to Payscale.But the report found that plenty of companies are contemplating \"peanut butter\" raises: Along with the 9% of organizations that already practice across-the-board pay increases, 16% said they were newly planning to implement the approach this year and 18% said they were considering it.\"There's always a tension in organizations of how to how to balance the needs of your high performers while taking care of the entire group,\" says Scott Hoffhines, a compensation expert and the vice president of rewards and systems at SalesLoft, especially when companies have \"limited resources.\"Still, in Hoffhines' view, companies that implement \"peanut butter\" raises should be aware that they are \"essentially giving up on their top talent,\" he says — and that could lead to morale and retention problems down the line. Why companies are giving 'peanut butter' raisesThe concept of \"peanut butter\" pay raises isn't new, Hoffhines says. Last year, for example, Starbucks made headlines when it gave 2% raises to all corporate employees in an effort to reduce costs, according to The Wall Street Journal.Strained compensation budgets could be behind why some companies are implementing across-the-board raises, according to Paulson. \"These companies are under so much pressure to cut costs, and this feels like an easy way to do it,\" she says.Fairness is also a concern: The Payscale report noted that \"tying merit pay increases to performance ratings has come under criticism in recent years for being too subjective and prone to bias.\"Some companies may view across-the-board increases as a more \"equitable\" approach, according to leadership coach and talent development expert Sarah Eppink: They ensure that front-line employees who \"don't necessarily have the visibility of individuals in HQ offices\" aren't overlooked for pay raises, says Eppink, who is also an adjunct instructor at Bowling Green State University.\"Peanut butter\" raises are also easier to execute from an administrative perspective, Eppink adds. In general, managers don't want to \"have to deliver bad news,\" she says. Implementing across-the-board raises removes the need for \"difficult conversations\" about why certain employees will or won't receive merit-based increases.The impact of 'peanut butter' raisesAcross-the-board raises may seem \"equitable on the surface,\" but they can be discouraging for high-performing employees, according to Eppink.When pay increases are no longer tied to performance, workers who are \"hitting it out of the park\" will question, \"Why would I make exceptional contributions when the bare minimum is receiving the exact same reward that I did?\" she says.In the long term, these employees are likely to become \"disengaged\" and look for other jobs, Eppink says.Companies may not see the impact of \"peanut butter\" raises on retention right now, according to Paulson. In light of the \"challenging\" job market and low hiring rates, she says, many workers are reluctant to leave their current roles — and employers are well aware of that. \"In a competitive job market, companies don't really feel the need to increase compensation in the same ways that they would in another market,\" she says.However, employees who feel short-changed today are likely to look for other roles when the job market is more favorable, according to Eppink. Cutting into compensation is \"such a short-sighted strategy\" for companies, Paulson says. Top performers will be \"out the door as soon as they can\" when they find employers that better compensate them for their skills, she says.During the Great Resignation, for example, people voluntarily left their jobs at record rates — 47.8 million people quit in 2021 and 50.5 million people quit in 2022, compared to 42.1 million in 2019. More than a third (37%) of employees said that low pay was a major reason they moved on in 2021, according to a Pew Research Center study.What employees can doIn the past, Paulson says she would advise employees who were disappointed with their pay raises to talk to their managers and make a case for a larger increase. But in today's job market, she knows employees are nervous to \"rock the boat,\" she says.\"Everything feels a little bit more tenuous,\" Paulson says. \"It feels a little bit riskier to go in and have those kinds of conversations with your manager.\" Still, it doesn't hurt to ask your manager if you could be eligible for any other benefits, such as additional vacation time.If you're considering switching jobs, Paulson recommends updating your resume, optimizing your LinkedIn profile and setting up job alerts to \"dip your toe in the water and see what's out there.\" \"You never know: You might find a great opportunity with people that really appreciate what you bring to the table and will pay you what you're worth,\" she says.Still, Eppink recommends taking a step back to evaluate the \"long game\" before deciding to leave your job over compensation concerns. \"I would not counsel anybody to use this one instance to make a life-altering decision as big as leaving an employer,\" she says, \"especially right now.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "The White House announced the “Tech Corps” initiative within the Peace Corps aimed at promoting American AI abroad and helping partner nations adopt cutting-edge systems.HandoutAs competition with China intensifies, Washington is turning to a cornerstone of American soft power and diplomacy to expand its global influence in artificial intelligence: the Peace Corps. The White House on Friday announced the \"Tech Corps\" initiative within the Peace Corps aimed at promoting American AI abroad and helping partner nations adopt cutting-edge systems.The Peace Corps is an independent U.S. government agency that sends American volunteers abroad to support local development projects, including in education, health, agriculture and economic growth.The new Tech Corps will be structured similarly but will recruit, train, and deploy volunteers with tech skills, including engineers and graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to provide \"last-mile\" support for the implementation of American AI solutions abroad, particularly at the application layer.A website for the Tech Corps has launched and is accepting applications, which it says will be accepted on a rolling basis. In an announcement, the Peace Corps said that the AI solutions the new group implements would be put towards \"real-world grassroots problems\" in key sectors, including agriculture, education, health, and economic development.Volunteers would be sent to countries participating in the American AI Exports Program, announced in July under a Trump administration executive order aimed at maintaining U.S. dominance in advanced technologies globally. The executive order aligns with broader U.S. efforts to counter the influence of Chinese technologies globally, including in developing nations.Chinese firms have gained traction in some developing nations by offering open-source or open-weight models that are inexpensive, highly customizable, and able to run on local infrastructure — including Qwen3 and Deepseek.AI sovereigntyWhile a full list of countries taking part in the AI Exports Program remains unclear, India is expected to be among them, with the Commerce Department welcoming its participation last week.  That statement had come ahead of the inaugural India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi, where Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, first announced the Tech Corps. India is also joining the U.S.-led Pax Silica initiative — a Trump administration effort aimed at securing the global supply chain for silicon-based technologies —  alongside Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, Israel, the United Kingdom, Australia, Qatar and the UAE as core members.At the summit, Kratsios argued that expanding access to U.S. AI technologies was central to closing the gap in global AI adoption between developed and developing economies. \"Real AI sovereignty means owning and using best-in-class technology for the benefit of your people,\" he said. AI sovereignty — which was a major topic at the Indian AI conference — refers to a country's ability to develop, control and govern artificial intelligence systems within its own legal, economic and strategic framework.The summit saw a number of American tech companies announce major investments in India's AI infrastructure, building on the billions announced last year, aligning with the goals of the Tech Corps. \"AI is the future, and as the undisputed world leader in AI technology, the United States, through the Tech Corps, will be at the forefront of delivering these benefits,\" said Richard E. Swarttz, acting Peace Corps director.Tech Corps volunteers will serve abroad for 12 to 27 months or participate in virtual service placements, with on-ground deployments expected to begin in fall 2026. As with the Peace Corps, volunteers will receive housing, healthcare, a living stipend, and service awards upon completion.In addition to the Tech Corps, the White House also announced other initiatives during the India AI summit, including a National Champions Initiative to integrate leading foreign AI companies into customized American AI export stacks. \"We recognize that partners need the chance to build their native technology industries, and believe facilitating this will be a critical part of the exports program,\" the White House said. It also announced new initiatives to help partner countries \"overcome financing obstacles as they import the American AI stack,\" through other soft-power institutions such as the World Bank and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation.",

    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin fell as much as 5% to below $65,000 on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to raise global tariffs to 15%. The cryptocurrency has since pared losses, falling over 3% to $65,167 as of 12.18 a.m. ET.The drop came as Asian equities rose in early trade, underscoring crypto's divergence from regional stock markets amid renewed tariff uncertainty.Bitcoin has seen a sharp sell-off since October last year when it crossed $125,000, with the downturn extending into the new year. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 26% so far this year and has lost over 47% since the October high. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin drops\"We believe that the sudden uptick in tariff rates is causing investors to sell crypto assets in anticipation of a more serious market decline,\" said Jeff Mei, COO at global blockchain technology company BTSE.Investors are also concerned that the build-up of U.S. military forces around Iran raises the possibility of an armed conflict that could spread regionally and impact global trade flows, he added.There has been massive U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, with Trump signaling last Thursday that he would decide in the next 10 days whether to launch strikes against Iran.Markus Thielen, head of research at market intelligence platform 10x Research, said bitcoin's latest drop was driven less by a single headline and more by weak liquidity and low conviction in the market. Thielen said the downturn fits a typical bear-market phase characterized by low volumes and uncertainty tied to U.S. midterm elections, expecting further downside toward $50,000 before a more durable bottom forms.Safe-haven demand saw spot gold trading about 1.5% higher Monday, showing a strong divergence from bitcoin, which has often been referred to as \"digital gold,\" including by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Bitcoin was last at $64,816.8, down 5.3%, while ether — the second most popular cryptocurrency — was down nearly 6% at $1,865.7Earlier this month, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan attributed bitcoin's slide primarily to the crypto market's \"four-year cycle,\" arguing that the current retracement mirrors patterns seen in past downturns. Bitwise has more than $15 billion in assets under management, and is heavily into crypto ETFs.Hougan highlighted there was no single catalyst behind the losses, pointing instead to investors rotating into gold and artificial intelligence stocks, lingering concerns over Fed nominee Kevin Warsh and broader \"quantum risk.\" Bitcoin had hit a more than 1-year low of $63,119.8 on Feb. 5.— CNBC's Blair Bao contributed to this report.",

Photo: Yolande CheeYolande CheeIndia hosted one of the world's biggest AI events this week, but it was marred by chaos and confusion, apparently not the message it's trying to send as it strives to become a leading artificial intelligence player.Despite the drama, U.S. tech firms in particular couldn't resist the temptation of the Indian market, talking up the country's AI potential and making a number of announcements.I have been on the ground in New Delhi since Monday and I can honestly say that the AI Impact Summit has been one of the most challenging reporting assignments of my career.Traffic has been a nightmare more than usual in the Indian capital. There were times it didn't move at all. On Wednesday, I had events and interviews at three different hotels and getting the team around to these appointments on time was a real challenge.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalAt one point on Thursday, were weren't even sure if we'd be able to enter the Bharat Mandapam, the venue where the summit took place. That's because instructions were not clear on when media would be allowed in on Thursday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event.We eventually found out we could enter at 6 a.m. local time. When we turned up, security did not let us in until later, not before a crowd of media had gathered at the gates. Inside, security were giving out conflicting instructions. Several delegates expressed to me their frustrations over the organization of the summit. The event itself was marred by other controversies. Bill Gates, who was named in the Epstein files, was scheduled to give a keynote address. There was then uncertainty if he would even turn up. The Gates Foundation had said earlier in the week that he would give the speech, but then on Thursday said the billionaire had pulled out.Meanwhile, a university was reportedly kicked out of the summit for suggesting a robot dog they were showcasing was its own creation. A professor at Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot, which was actually made by Chinese firm Unitree, was \"developed\" by the academic institution.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalOnline users called out the university, highlighting that the robot was made by a Chinese firm. The university denied claiming it had built the robot.\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavor to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real-world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is [the] need of the hour,\" the university said, according to media reports.Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw apologized on Tuesday for the \"problems\" on day one.

Modi had delegates on stage with everyone holding hands. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't do as they they'd been instructed, in a moment that instantly got scrutinized across social media. Altman later explained that he was \"confused\" and wasn't sure what he should be doing.Days earlier, Anthropic ran a Super Bowl ad taking digs at OpenAI's decision to test advertisements in ChatGPT. India's lureDespite all of these moments, the event pulled in a who's who of tech names from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to Altman, all of whom talked up India's advantages from a huge talent pool to a large consumer market. \"The excitement here, it's just been incredible to watch,\" Altman told me. These tech firms used the week to make announcements and form partnerships around India. OpenAI said it would be the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services' data center business. Google announced partnerships with researchers and education institutions for its Gemini artificial intelligence feature.Read moreEvery CEO I spoke to praised India's tech development and focus. The government used the opportunity to tout India's potential as an AI hub saying the country was aiming to attract $200 billion in AI investment over the next two years.Even the blaring horns of the cars of New Delhi and the chaos of the Summit weren't enough to dampen the enthusiasm from big tech for India which continues to grow as a critical and attractive market for some of the world's largest firms.",

The president maintains a residence at Mar-a-Lago, and frequently dines and hosts events at the Palm Beach club.The man was shot by Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff deputy at around 1:30 a.m. ET after entering the secure perimeter around Mar-a-Lago near its north gate and then raising the shotgun at an officer, authorities said.The man who was shot has been identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin of North Carolina, according to an FBI statement on Sunday. Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference on Sunday that \"a deputy and two Secret Service agents on the detail went to that area to investigate.\"\"They confronted a white male [who] was carrying a gas can and a shotgun,\" Bradshaw said. \"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position.\"\"At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat,\" Bradshaw said.The FBI is investigating the incident.\"Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.She also knocked Democrats over the partial government shutdown, which impacted the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the Secret Service. \"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department,\" Leavitt said. DHS has been shuttered for more than a week. Democrats are demanding changes to how the department conducts immigration enforcement operations before agreeing to fund the agency, after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump narrowly avoided assassination in July 2024 when a gunman shot at him from a roof overlooking a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A Secret Service sniper killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.Two months after that attempt, another would-be assassin, Ryan Routh, was arrested less than an hour after a Secret Service agent fired at Routh as he lay in wait with a rifle outside a golf course where Trump was playing.Routh was convicted of trying to kill Trump. He was recently sentenced to life in prison. ",

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"",

Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Armando L. Sanchez | Chicago Tribune | Getty ImagesThe Transportation Security Administration said on Sunday that its PreCheck airport screening lanes are operational, an about-face hours after the Department of Homeland Security said the faster security checkpoints were paused amid the partial government shutdown.Travel industry leaders said they received little, if any, warning of the changes to PreCheck, a program that allows its 20 million pre-screened members to pass through airport security faster than at standard lanes. Industry members spoke with DHS officials in the past few hours and expressed alarm about the sudden decision, people familiar with the matter said.\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" TSA officials said in a statement. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly. Courtesy escorts, such as those for Members of Congress, have been suspended to allow officers to focus on the mission of securing America's skies.\"The agency said that \"until funding is restored, all travelers should expect a process that does not sacrifice security. \"DHS early Sunday said that PreCheck and Global Entry and other program suspensions were scheduled to take effect at 6 a.m. ET on Sunday. As of 12:40 p.m. ET, its updated statement still included a suspension of Global Entry but it had removed its mention of PreCheck.\"We are glad that DHS has decided to keep PreCheck operational and avoid a crisis of its own making,\" Geoff Freeman, chief executive of U.S. Travel, an industry group whose members include major airlines, hotel chains like Hyatt and Marriott International and tourism boards around the country.The move comes as a partial U.S. government shutdown that has left thousands of DHS workers, including TSA airport screeners, working without pay since it started on Feb. 14.\"TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.Noem blamed Democrats for the shutdown. Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over immigration policy.\"Shutdowns have real world consequences, not just for the men and women of DHS and their families who go without a paycheck, but it endangers our national security,\" she said. \"The American people depend on this department every day, and we are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage inflicted by these politicians.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-N.Y.), pushed back, saying the Trump administration is \"choosing to inflict pain on the public instead of adopting common sense\" reforms of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.DHS did not say whether it expected to reverse its suspension of Global Entry or what prompted the change. The White House referred an inquiry from CNBC to DHS.Travel industry experts sharply criticized the move before it was reversed, which comes just months after last year's record federal government shutdown cost airlines millions of dollars and hurt bookings, according to executives.The sector's leaders have consistently complained about how air travel has ended up at the center of repeated shutdowns and have pushed lawmakers to ensure that essential government workers are paid during funding lapses.A government shutdown in 2019 ended shortly after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights. Air traffic controller shortages, already problematic, also spiked during the 2025 government closure, snarling air travel shortly before it ended in November.The government shutdown in the fall, the longest ever, cost the travel industry and other sectors $6.1 billion, the group said. Those disruptions affected about 6 million travelers.\"A4A is deeply concerned that TSA PreCheck and Global Entry programs are being suspended and that the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,\" said Airlines for America CEO Chris Sununu. The group represents American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and other major carriers. \"The announcement was issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly, which is especially troubling at this time of record air travel,\" he added.Read more CNBC airline newsUnited Airlines is overhauling its MileagePlus loyalty program to favor credit cardholdersSpirit Airlines sells more planes, calls back 500 flight attendants from furlough ahead of spring breakFAA abruptly halted El Paso flights over Defense Department’s plans for anti-drone technologyPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsSouthwest ends open seating after 54 years.

    "body": "The original six American Girl historical characters — Kirsten Larson, Samantha Parkington, Molly McIntire, Felicity Merriman, Addy Walker and Josefina Montoya — are displayed at the brand’s flagship store,Luke FountainThe flagship American Girl Place at Rockefeller Center in New York City feels frozen in time.The air smells faintly of vanilla. Young girls dart between doll displays clutching miniature shirts and sequined shoes. Beneath glittering chandeliers, the brand's iconic red boxes line shelves with museum-like precision. Blow dryers hum in the Doll Salon, and downstairs, pink-frosted cupcakes land on cafe tables before dolls sitting upright in their miniature highchairs.\"It feels timeless,\" said Jamie Cygielman, global head of dolls for Mattel, the brand's parent company. And yet, behind the scenes, the business of American Girl dolls is not what it once was. As American Girl turns 40, the brand is navigating more modern challenges: digital competition, shifting play patterns and an aging, more cost-conscious customer base. \"The anniversary is at precarious moment for American Girl and the whole doll industry,\" said Jaime Katz, an analyst who covers Mattel for Morningstar. \"Kids are more digital in play, and the [American Girl] brand has struggled.\"Around a decade ago, at its peak, American Girl was recording more than $600 million in annual sales. By 2023, annual sales had fallen to roughly $200 million — just a third of prior levels.While American Girl has shrunk back considerably from the mid-2010s, the brand has more recently posted five consecutive quarters of sales growth — one of the few steady performers inside Mattel's portfolio. \"Growing off a base that's down more than 60% doesn't mean the brand is back. It means it's stabilizing,\" Katz told CNBC.Earlier this month, Mattel reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.77 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations after holiday demand came in lighter than projected and heavier discounting weighed on margins. Earnings per share likewise fell short, and Mattel issued a lower-than-expect profit forecast for 2026.Mattel shares have fallen roughly 19% since the Feb. 10 report and are down about 20% over the past year. Citi and JPMorgan downgraded the stock after the results, too. \"People are watching Mattel this year ... waiting with baited breath, because they are spending a ton and it seems unlikely they will be bringing in big profits,\" Katz said.A doll gets her hair washed, brushed and curled at the American Girl Salon at the brand's flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainLongstanding issuesEven before the Covid pandemic forced American Girl to reduce its retail footprint from about 15 stores in 2019 to seven U.S. locations today, the brand faced mounting competition from lower-priced alternatives at big-box retailers like Target's \"Our Generation\" line. A traditional, 18-inch American Girl typically starts at $135, excluding accessories, which can cost as much as $250 for a bunk bed or $275 for a beach cruiser. The premium price once signaled to many parents a mark of quality and prestige, said Laura Tretter, co-host of the American Girl Women podcast. But in an inflation-conscious environment, it's narrowed the customer base, Katz said.\"Parents are more selective about discretionary spending right now,\" Katz said. \"That price point [for an American Girl doll] looks steep to many households.\"Across the toy industry, companies, including competitors like Hasbro, are grappling with how to get kids interested in their products, particularly amid uneven consumer spending and, recently, trade uncertainty. \"There are so many more things today that a kid might be enticed by to play with,\" Cygielman told CNBC. \"There's also more competition today, and we saw in the past that tariffs can make an impact on the toy market, but we adapt.\"For many kids, play has migrated toward tablets, gaming subscriptions and short-form video. \"The definition of 'toy' has changed,\" Katz said. \"A iPad or Nintendo Switch competes directly with a doll. There are simply more claims on the same discretionary dollar.\"Overall, Mattel's doll and preschool categories have faced steady declines for the last three quarters, even after the halo effect of 2023's \"Barbie\" movie. Global dolls sales fell 7% in the latest quarter, while the infant, toddler and preschool segment declined 17%.Struggling sales for American Girl and Mattel's Fisher Price brand motivated activist investor Barington Capital in 2024 to push the company to streamline its portfolio and improve returns, floating the possibility of selling off the brands. \"American Girl is not a huge part of Mattel's overall financial profile,\" Katz said. \"Still though, for investors, the question isn't whether the brand is beloved. It's whether it's strategically essential. It was a drag on profits.\"A girl waits with her new Truly Me doll at the American Girl flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainCapitalizing on loyaltyInside the Rockefeller Center store, those industry headwinds feel distant.On a recent visit, Lisa Kandoski stood gazing at Molly McIntire — the World War II-era heroine adorned with round wire-rimmed glasses, a navy argyle sweater and braids tied in red ribbons — just like the doll Kandoski said her grandmother put under the Christmas tree in 1990.\"It's not just a doll,\" Kandoski, now 40, told CNBC, her eyes misty. \"I sort of realized the impact Molly had on me as a kid. She taught me that you could be brave even when the world was scary, that you could 'do your part' even when you were small. She shaped who I am.\"That emotional alchemy has defined American Girl since it disrupted the doll industry in 1986. At the time, the market was dominated by either fashion dolls mirroring adulthood or baby dolls to rehearse motherhood. The original six American Girl characters — Samantha, Kirsten, Molly, Felicity, Addy and Josefina — came with books tackling subjects rarely taught to young kids like child labor or racism, and all dolls treated girlhood itself as a formative stage.\"American Girl remains a moral compass for many of us,\" said Tretter of the American Girl Women podcast. \"I love that girls today are still getting positive messages about inclusivity, friendship and going through difficult changes.\"Over time, American Girl expanded into publishing, film and destination retail while diversifying its characters, like with the 2026 \"Girl of the Year,\" Raquel Reyes, a biracial DJ and animal rescuer who helps run her family's Kansas City paleta shop.The brand's whimsical seriousness became a differentiator and fostered generational loyalty, said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a folklorist and author of \"An American Girl Anthology: Finding Ourselves in the Pleasant Company Universe.\"Look no further than the Doll Hospital where white-coated \"doctors\" triage patients, fit wheelchairs, perform eye exams, and apply miniature casts for doll owners of all ages.\"That's why people return,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"You're not just buying plastic and fabric. You're revisiting a version of yourself.\"And even though the dolls remain preserved in childhood innocence, their original owners, now grown up, keep returning to American Girl through podcasts, memes, cosplay and fan fiction. Some pass their dolls down to their children. Others buy new ones for themselves.\"There's something powerful about handing your daughter the doll you once slept beside,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"It's also just as comforting to go back to the days of your youth with your own doll.\" American Girl is releasing modernized version of its original six characters for the brand's 40th anniversary.MattelA growing baseMattel is battling to convert that nostalgia into broader sales growth. So‑called \"kidult\" consumers — adults who buy toys for themselves — have become a coveted demographic. By late 2024, spending on toys for adults 18 and older had surpassed that for children ages 3 to 5, according to market research firm Circana. That cohort continued to drive industry growth in 2025.Mattel has increasingly sought to monetize its intellectual property through publishing, collectibles, entertainment and digital platforms. In interviews and on calls with investors, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz has said that mobile games and interactive platforms are particularly promising areas. However, \"nostalgia must translate into durable revenue and sales growth,\" Katz said. Lean too heavily into adult collectors, and a brand risks \"aging alongside its original audience.\" Pivot too aggressively toward digital trends, and it \"risks diluting what made it distinctive.\"Competitors have been doing the same. For instance, Lego continues to release more brick building sets aimed at adults like flowers, art and collectables based on millennial pop culture favorites such as the 1990s TV hit \"Friends.\" For American Girl, its 40th anniversary offers a natural inflection point to strike a balance between kid and adult fans, Cygielman said.American Girl is releasing modernized versions of its original six characters and publishing its first book for adults, centered on Samantha Parkington and set during her adulthood in the 1920s. At the same time, the brand is working to keep the next generation engaged through contemporary \"Girl of the Year\" storylines and investments in digital platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and \"American Girl World\" on Roblox.\"Nostalgia is an entry point, not the endgame,\" Cygielman said. \"The question is how we extend that emotional equity into new platforms and new audiences.\"",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAirlines canceled thousands of flights through Monday night and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine as another massive winter storm bears down on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts nearly 50 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were more than 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 3,800 flights on Monday, or 15% of the scheduled U.S. departures, were canceled, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Usually daily cancellations are around 1%.More than 90% of the departures from LaGuardia Airport, Boston Logan Airport and 80% of those from Philadelphia and Kennedy Airport on Monday were canceled Monday.Sunday's cancellation rate was about 10% as of 6:10 p.m. ET, according to Cirium.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26.

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

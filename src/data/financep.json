    "body": "Renovation work continues on the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, the main offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, Dec. 9, 2025.Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Thursday reappointed 11 of its 12 regional bank presidents, ending a minidrama at the central bank in a move that came a bit earlier than usual.By unanimous vote, the seven governors kept in place a cast of officials that also includes first vice presidents at the branches that extend across the country. The group of presidents did not include the Atlanta Fed, whose president, Raphael Bostic, is retiring in February. Though the regional reserve banks act independently and hire their own presidents, the moves are subject to board approval in Washington, D.C. The presidents serve five-year terms, which in this case will commence March 1, 2026, and can be removed at will by the board.Normally, the Fed waits until closer to the Feb. 28 expiration date of the terms to announce reappointments. The terms historically have ended in years ending in one or six.There had been some speculation about whether President Donald Trump, a fierce Fed critic, would seek to exert more control over the rate-setting process by removing some regional presidents. The Federal Open Market Committee sets the central bank's key interest rate with a voting group that includes the chair, the other six governors, the New York Fed president and a rotating cast of four other regional presidents.However, the unanimous vote included Governor Stephen Miran, a recent Trump appointee whose term expires in January.Moreover, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently complained that New York holds disproportionate sway over the Fed as several presidents are from the city but serving in other areas. They include Lorie Logan, who previously ran the trading desk at the New York Fed and now helms the Dallas district, and former Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack, who is in Cleveland.Bessent floated a proposal by which regional presidents would be required to be residents of their district for three years.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon shares jumped more than 9% on Friday, after the company announced its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down. McDonald's departure, effective Jan. 31, follows more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. Lululemon's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate markets could get an influx of capital and investors under legislation approved by the House on ThursdayThe package of capital-formation bills, called the INVEST Act, passed the House 302 to 123. Eighty-seven Democrats joined every Republican in the House to support the bill. The wide-ranging package of legislation would allow more investors access to private markets. Lawmakers say the measure will help more companies go public and increase capital formation for startups.Instead of only wealth or income determining who can be an accredited investor, investors could become accredited by taking an exam approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said the bill was needed in part because of the decrease in the number of public companies in America. \"We make it easier to be a public company in America,\" Hill said on the House floor during debate on the bill. \"\"We make it easier, if you have a great idea, to crowdsource that idea, to raise money from friends and family. And we make it easier, if you're an individual investor, to have other opportunities in which to invest.\"The bill also would lift the cap for how much venture capital firms can raise, and how many people can invest, before they are subject to stricter disclosure and compliance regulations.The bill increases the number of investors to 500 from 250, and increases funds to $50 million from $10 million. It also would become easier for venture capital firms to invest in each other  — a change lawmakers say will help more funds reach companies in places like the Midwest and the South. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said that unicorn companies  — privately held startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more  — used to be rare. Now, he said there are \"herds of unicorns\" which limit investing opportunities for the public. \"We're trying to make sure that this is open and accessible to folks, and I think that's going to be a healthier approach for both the public markets and the private markets,\" Huizenga said. The bill now heads to the Senate, where making capital formation easier is on Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott's to-do list. It is not clear if the Senate will take up the House package, move individual pieces of it, or try to do its own bill. ",

    "body": "Shoppers purchase groceries at the upscale LuLu Hypermarket located in the Lulu International Shopping Mall in Kerala, India, on May 25, 2022.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's consumer inflation rose to 0.71% in November, accelerating from an all-time low of 0.25% in the prior month.The headline inflation number was in line with estimates of a 0.70% rise in the consumer price index, according to a Reuters poll of economists' median estimates.The rise in consumer inflation was due to rises in the price of vegetables, eggs, meat and fish, spices and fuel, the government said in its Friday release, adding that fuel and light prices rose 2.32% in November compared to 1.98% in October.Inflation also rose in both urban and rural areas. Low inflation environment, coupled with the weakening of some key economic indicators, led India's central bank to cut its policy rates by 25 basis points last week, allowing it to boost the country's already strong economic growth.The Reserve Bank of India expects consumer inflation at 2% for fiscal year ending March 2026, down from 2.6% forecast in October. It estimates CPI at 2.9% in the three months to March, rising to 4.0% in the quarter ending September 2026.\"The growth-inflation balance, especially the benign inflation outlook on both headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth momentum,\" the central bank said last week after its monetary policy meeting.Low inflation outlook has allowed the central bank \"to remain growth supportive,\" RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said, adding that the central bank will \"continue to meet productive requirements of the economy in a proactive manner.\"Experts are divided on whether the 25-basis-point cut will be the last in this easing cycle or the RBI could ease further, given Malhotra's \"dovish\" signals.\"We believe weaker growth down the line, low for long inflation, and tight fiscal policy may require growth supportive monetary policy in 2026 as well,\" HSBC Research said in a report last week, post the monetary policy announcement.In August, the U.S. imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to as high as 50%, among the steepest imposed by Washington on its trading partners, with textiles, gems and jewelry, and marine products being hit the hardest.While exports to the U.S. account for just about 2% of India's GDP, a prolonged weakness in those labor-intensive sectors could lead to job losses and weigh on overall growth.To cushion the blow, New Delhi rationalized its goods and services tax regime, reducing levies on several items on Sept. 22, to spur domestic demand ahead of a month-long festive season. The tax cuts led to reduced prices for consumer goods, vehicles, and farm products, boosting consumption.While consumption picked up, exports to the U.S., one of India's major trading partners, fell for a second straight month in October, sliding 8.5% from a year earlier to $6.3 billion. Overall, outbound shipments in October also dropped 11.8% to $34.38 billion. With no deal between New Delhi and Washington in sight, in the last few days, and a drop in exports, the Indian rupee has been hitting record lows against the dollar, and was trading below the 90-rupee-per-dollar mark on Friday.

    "body": "Customers walk in the parking lot outside a Costco store on Dec. 2, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesCostco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street's quarterly expectations and posted year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% as the retailer attracted more digital sales and opened new locations.The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said e-commerce gains were one of the strengths of the quarter. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Traffic on its website increased 24% year over year and traffic on its app shot up 48%. Same-day delivery service offered through Instacart in the U.S. and Uber and DoorDash internationally grew at a faster pace than overall digital sales.Costco had a positive start to the busiest weeks of the holiday season, too. Millerchip said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for the warehouse club's U.S. e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders.Here's how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expectedRevenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expectedCostco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers' renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco's net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Sales in non-food were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics and apparel, which grew by double-digits year-over-year, Millerchip said.In the first quarter, Costco opened eight new warehouse clubs, including a relocation in Canada, its third location in France, four new locations in the U.S. and two additional Canadian business centers, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's earnings call. Business centers tend to sell bulk items intended for restaurants and other types of businesses. Those additional locations bring its total store count to 921 around the world.He said the company plans to continue to open 30 or more clubs per year in future years.Read moreAs a warehouse club, Costco relies on membership fees to boost its revenue and help keep the price of its items low. With higher tariffs, however, the retailer has dealt with rising costs. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.Inflation \"remained relatively consistent with recent quarters,\" Millerchip said. He said in grocery, Costco saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood and coffee, but that was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter and produce. In non-food, he said Costco saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Millerchip said on the earnings call that Costco has looked for ways to reduce the impact of the duties, including sourcing more items from the U.S., consolidating buying across the globe to lower the cost of goods and swapping out categories or items to ones that aren't as exposed to steep tariff costs.Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is another way to offset tariff prices because it has more control over the supply chain, he said.In late November, Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs that it has paid so far this year and to block those import duties from being collected from the company as it waits for a Supreme Court ruling on the duties.As of the end of the quarter, Costco had 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% year over year and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year over year, Millerchip said. Its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada was 92.2% and its worldwide rate was 89.7%, slipping a bit as more customers sign up for memberships online and those members renew at a slightly lower rate.As of Thursday's close, Costco's shares have declined nearly 4% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 17% gains during the same period. However, over the past five years, Costco's stock has jumped by 141%. The company's stock closed at $884.48 on Thursday, bringing its market value to $392.67 billion.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep home prices gains and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the last five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York City are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market. Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead,\" Hepp said.",

    "body": "A Broadcom sign is pictured as the company prepares to launch new optical chip tech to fend off Nvidia in San Jose, California, U.S., September 5, 2025.  Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock initially rose in extended trading before declining more than 4% during the earnings call.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimatedRevenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimatedBroadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG.CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies from the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units.On an earnings call with analysts, the company said it had acquired a fifth customer for its custom chips, and revealed that Anthropic was the previously unnamed customer that had placed a $10 billion order for Google's TPUs during the quarter. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on track to buy and deploy custom chips. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer that ordered $10 billion in custom chips and the next month announced a partnership with OpenAI to develop custom chips. Tan said that he didn't expect much revenue from that partnership in 2026. Anthropic is using the latest Google TPU called Ironwood, Tan said on Thursday's earnings call.Tan said Broadcom's other customers \"prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multi-year journey to create their own custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, as we call them.\"Broadcom has a $73 billion backlog for custom chips, switches, and other data center parts for AI over the next 18 months, Tan said. Total revenue grew 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales. That would equate to $8.2 billion in AI revenue in the fourth quarter.AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.

Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The move marks a win for tech companies like OpenAI and Google and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz that have lobbied to limit regulations they view as overly burdensome. AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

    "body": "Lauripatterson | E+ | Getty ImagesConsumers are still dining out, but instead of higher-priced entrees, many are ordering more appetizers. As food inflation and affordability dominates the conversation about the U.S. consumer, new restaurant purchasing data shows even among Americans who are going to restaurants, many are in the mindset of cutting back.\"Appetizer orders are up 20% year over year, even as entrees and desserts are largely flat or declining,\" said Jim Pazzanese, executive vice president of global strategic procurement of Buyers Edge Platform, which tracks supply chain data within the food service industry. \"The shift is visible at the item level,\" he said, with some popular appetizer sales to restaurant operators experiencing growth rates north of 30%.Top-growing appetizersMozzarella sticks, up 36%Pickle chips, up 35%Cheese curds, up 33%Jalapeno poppers, up 20%Cheese bites, up 17%Source: Buyers Edge, year-to-date dataPazzanese is calling the current restaurant environment the \"appetizer economy.\"Meanwhile, he says dessert orders are down 2 percent year over year.One reason for the rising popularity of appetizers, Pazzanese says, is their link to promotions, which are key to getting Americans to spend in the current economic environment.\"Consumers realize appetizers are more frequently tied to promotions and drink specials,\" he said. \"This makes eating out more affordable.\"He added that buying of frozen or shelf-stable appetizers, which are the fastest-growing appetizer SKUs, makes sense from an economic perspective for restaurant operators, too. \"This is helping owners and managers reduce waste and manage unpredictable demands,\" Pazzanese said.\"The K-shaped economy we are seeing is being reflected in food spending,\" said Brian Choi, CEO of the Food Institute. In the grocery store, he said that is being seen in the continued migration to private label brands as food inflation influences consumer purchasing.\"The top 10 percent are increasing their spending in novel products and are willing to pay, but the vast majority of consumers are moving down to private label versus national brands,\" said Choi. \"Consumers can save anywhere from 10-20 percent by switching to a private label,\" Choi added.In a recent Food Institute survey, consumer perception of private labels has gone up substantially over the last five years, and it is now on par with national brands.\"Albertsons, Costco, and Kroger are just some examples of companies increasing their shelf space for their own,\" Choi said.\"Save Mart launched a private-label for beef, poultry, and pork, and Amazon launched Amazon Grocery with many products under $5,\" Choi said. \"Albertsons believes private label could represent 30 percent of sales.\"Amazon debuted its private-label grocer in October.While inflation may be down from 2022 highs, food inflation has been stubborn, according to Food Institute data. \"Food price inflation has increased since the midpoint of 2025, with food-at-home prices up in the range of 1.9 percent to 2.7 percent year-over-year,\" Choi said.The latest consumer price index for September — the October report was not produced due to the government shutdown and the November report delayed — showed food prices up 3.1% year over year. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year.\"We expect further growth for private label, and it should outpace national brands in 2026,\" Choi said.The September CPI showed \"food away from home\" inflation even higher than food inflation overall, at 3.7%, with full-service meals at 4.2%. That is leading to more private-label spending by restaurants, college and university dining halls, and convenience stores.\"The $1.5 trillion food away from home industry is seeing the move to more private label brands to save money,\" said Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the IFMA, the Food Away from Home Association.\"Tariffs and supply chain issues have led to price increases, especially in perishable items,\" Kafarakis said.Pricing relief is not expected to arrive soon.\"Consumers do not understand the food supply chain,\" Kafarakis said. \"It doesn't correct itself in weeks.\"IMFA expects that consumers will start to see some price relief from tariffs in the spring.\"Consumers do not know how long it takes to produce beef, and if you have a drought or other problems that impact the supply chain, it takes time to build the supply chain back up,\" Kafarakis said.",

    "body": "A Broadcom sign is pictured as the company prepares to launch new optical chip tech to fend off Nvidia in San Jose, California, U.S., September 5, 2025.  Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom revealed during a September earnings call that it had signed a customer that had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips. At the time, Broadcom didn't say who it was, but on Thursday, CEO Hock Tan revealed that the mystery customer was AI lab Anthropic, which placed an order for the latest Google tensor processing units.\"We received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic,\" said Tan, speaking on Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. He also said Anthropic had placed an additional $11 billion order with Broadcom in the company's latest quarter. While Broadcom typically doesn't disclose its large customers, Tan's September remark drew significant investor attention amid the AI infrastructure boom. A Broadcom official told CNBC in October that the mystery customer wasn't OpenAI, which has its own agreement to purchase chips from the chipmaker. Broadcom makes custom chips called ASICs, which some experts believe are more efficient for certain artificial intelligence algorithms than the market-dominating chips from Nvidia. Broadcom helps make Google's TPUs, and last month, the search company bragged that it trained its state-of-the-art Gemini 3 model entirely on its TPUs. The chipmaker calls its custom AI chips XPUs, and on Thursday, Tan said his company was delivering entire server racks — not just chips — to Anthropic, which is Broadcom's fourth XPU customer. Broadcom on Thursday also said that it has secured a fifth customer for its custom chip business. That customer placed a $1 billion order during the fourth quarter, but once again, Broadcom did not reveal the customer. \"It's a real customer, and it will grow,\" Tan said. watch nowGoogle-Anthropic dealIn late October, Anthropic and Google announced a sweeping cloud partnership that underscored just how quickly the AI infrastructure race is moving. The deal is valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The agreement gives Anthropic access to as many 1 million Google TPUs, and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of new AI compute capacity online in 2026. Anthropic employs a multi-cloud, multi-chip strategy. The startup spreads workloads across Google's TPUs, Amazon's custom Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units. Anthropic's various models are tuned to run on whichever platform makes the most sense for training, inference or research. For Google, Anthropic's bet on TPUs is exactly the kind of validation investors have been rewarding, as Wall Street increasingly ties Alphabet's stock run-up to clear demand for its in-house AI chips. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian previously said Anthropic's decision to dramatically expand its TPU usage reflects \"the strong price-performance and efficiency\" the startup has seen over several years.After more than a decade of internal development, Google is making TPUs widely available to cloud customers as a service, rather than selling the hardware outright, and has been leaning on its chips as a differentiator as it tries to keep pace with surging demand for AI compute.Analysts have described TPUs as the most credible alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. Analysts have argued that Google's tightly tailored ASICs and power-efficient designs could become a meaningful driver of the company's cloud business growth as power constraints — not chip supply — emerge as the key bottleneck for AI.

Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported on Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported the potential reclassification of pot, out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine, would take place early next year.Trump previously floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.'Positive' developmentGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.If Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, Groshans anticipates the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.More optimismThe industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" said Hauser. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and easier state classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018. The Amplify Cannabis ETF is still on track to lose more than 8% in 2025, its fifth straight down year.",

    "body": "State Senators listen to testimony at the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Kaiti Sullivan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Indiana Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly voted down a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to favor Republicans, in a major blow to President Donald Trump.The bill failed in a 19-31 vote, with most Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the measure that Trump had aggressively lobbied for. The GOP has a 40-vote majority in the 50-member Senate.Republicans were expected to gain two additional seats in the U.S. House of Representatives if the redistricting bill had been approved by the Senate. The state's House of Representatives voted in favor of the bill last Friday.Trump had threatened the state's Republican lawmakers with primary challenges if they did not support the bill.His failure to convince them is a rare loss in his effort to redraw congressional maps in red states.Trump had successfully pushed partisan gerrymanders in Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and Utah, as the GOP tries to retain it razor-thin majority in the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans hold 220 seats in that chamber, with Democrats holding 213 seats.Redistrictings are normally done after a new U.S. Census. The last census was done in 2020.The president and his top aides had launched a pressure campaign to pass the new Indiana district map, which included visits from Vice President JD Vance. In a post on X on Thursday morning, the right-wing group Heritage Action said, \"President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state.\"\"Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop,\" the group said in the tweet. \"These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\"Trump took to social media on Wednesday night to blast Indiana House Speaker Rod Bray for opposing redistricting. \"He is putting every ounce of his limited strength into asking his soon-to-be very vulnerable friends to vote with him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"By doing so, he is putting the Majority in the House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., at risk and, at the same time, putting anybody in Indiana who votes against this Redistricting, likewise, at risk,\" Trump wrote.Sen. Greg Goode, a Republican and a key swing vote who would not disclose his position on the bill despite immense pressure from the White House, voted against the measure. \"We have to redirect our focus to what really matters, I believe, to Hoosiers,\" Goode said in a speech on the floor before the vote. \"The forces that define this vitriolic political affairs in places outside of Indiana have been gradually and now very blatantly infiltrated the political affairs in Indiana,\" Goode said.He cited instances of misinformation, pressure campaigns and threats of primaries and violence.Goode was swatted earlier this year after Trump accused him of \"not wanting to resdistrict\" in a Truth Social post.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

States across the country have pushed redistricting for partisan advantage after the Supreme Court barred maps drawn for partisan advantage to be challenged. \"If we fail to secure a governing majority in the House that supports this agenda, we risk handing the keys back to the very people who destabilized the world in the first place,\" said Sen. Chris Garten, a Republican who supported the gerrymander. Trump's brazen push for gerrymanders that benefit Republicans has kicked off a nationwide war between states controlled by Republicans and Democrats. The maps that create each state's congressional districts are typically only drawn once every 10 years by state legislators after a census.  Republican-controlled Texas adopted a map in August to net the Republicans five additional seats. Democrat-controlled California then responded, adopting a new map in a November referendum that would net Democrats five additional seats.  Florida, Maryland and Virginia have pending redistricting measures. ",

    "body": "Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attends the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, July 15, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPalantir expanded its lawsuit against two former employees on Thursday to include the CEO of their new artificial intelligence startup, Percepta AI. In the suit, Palantir alleged that Percepta CEO and co-founder Hirsh Jain, co-founder Radha Jain and a third employee, Joanna Cohen, violated their non-solicitation agreements, hiring top talent to create a competitive business. The three defendants are accused of attempting to \"poach\" executives and developers from their former company and \"plunder Palantir's valuable intellectual property.\"Percepta denied using any of Palantir's confidential information, calling the case \"baseless,\" and said in a statement that the company was \"cherry-picking out-of-context soundbites.\"\"Palantir does not own the AI transformation space, which is massive and constantly evolving,\" Percept said. \"This is the latest in Palantir's effort to use fear tactics to bully ex-employees out of innovating with applied AI.\" Palantir didn't respond to a request for comment. Cohen and Radha Jain, who were named in the original lawsuit filed in October, were previously senior engineers at Palantir. Hirsh Jain, an executive responsible for the company's health-care portfolio, was added as another defendant in the latest complaint.Palantir said the defendants were \"entrusted\" with the company's \"crown jewels,\" including source code, customer workflows and proprietary customer engagement strategies.The former employees \"brazenly disregarded their contractual and legal commitments to Palantir and instead chose a path of deception and unjust competition,\" the plaintiffs said in the document, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.Cohen and Radha Jain denied the initial allegations in a November filing, and agreed to stop working for Percepta during the proceedings.The suit accused Hirsh Jain, who resigned from Palantir in August 2024, of an \"aggressive campaign\" to recruit other employees to join Percepta, and said the startup has already hired at least 10 former Palantir employees. A message allegedly written by Hirsh Jain in November 2024 read, \"I'm down to pillage the best devs at palantir when they're at their maximum richness.\"The complaint says Radha Jain wrote another message saying, \"God thinking about poaching is so fun.\"Palantir, which was co-founded by Peter Thiel, CEO Alex Karp and others, builds analytics software for companies and government agencies, including the U.S. military. The company's stock price has soared more than tenfold since the end of 2023, lifting its market cap close to $450 billion. Palantir also accused Cohen of sending herself highly confidential documents shortly after announcing her resignation from the company in March. Cohen allegedly took photos of sensitive information, the suit said, and downloaded the files onto her personal phone.\"At Percepta, they seek to succeed not through old-fashioned ingenuity and competition, but through outright theft and deceit,\" Palantir said in the filing.Among other things, Palantir is asking for the defendants to be forced to return any confidential information in their possession and to avoid working at Percepta or venture backer General Catalyst for 12 months from the time of an order.

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, center, speaks on a media tour of the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, Oracle told investors that it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia. That's not the only way the software giant plans to supply robust computing power to meet soaring demand. It's also ratcheting up leases.As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years, the company disclosed in a quarterly filing on Thursday. That's up 148% from the end of August.Oracle had $10 billion in cloud capacity arrangements at the end of the quarter, according to the filing. Over the past decade, Oracle has diversified into cloud infrastructure, where it now goes up against Amazon, Microsoft and Google to rent out access to servers, storage and Nvidia graphics chips for running artificial intelligence models. OpenAI has become a major Oracle cloud customer, having announced a commitment worth over $300 billion in September. Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor that for years served as the startup's sole cloud provider, has also ramped up leases to augment its in-house data center footprint. Microsoft has struck deals with so-called neoclouds CoreWeave and Lambda. Oracle worked with startup Crusoe to enable the first phase of OpenAI's Stargate data center site in Abilene, Texas.Investors are questioning how Oracle will pay for its AI data center build-outs, RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, told CNBC earlier this week.In September Oracle raised $18 billion in new debt. By the end of November, the company owed over $124 billion when including operating lease liabilities, according to the filing, up from about $89 billion a year earlier. \"In terms of funding our growth, there are a variety of sources available to us throughout our debt structure in public bond, bank and private debt markets,\" Doug Kehring, Oracle's principal financial officer, told analysts on Wednesday's conference call.Some customers can also bring their own chips, which could lower Oracle's costs, said Clay Magouyrk, one of the company's two recently appointed CEOs.In its earnings release on Wednesday, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected revenue despite booming demand for its AI infrastructure. The stock ended the day down almost 11% on Thursday.WATCH: Trade Tracker: Malcolm Ethridge sells out of Oraclewatch now",

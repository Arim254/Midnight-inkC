    "body": "It was 95 degrees when the first prototype of a Norwegian Wool jacket arrived at Michael Berkowitz's apartment in The Bronx, New York, in August 2014.Needing to test the waterproof knee-length wool coat without getting heat stroke, the founder and CEO of the then-fledgling apparel brand took it to a supermarket in West Harlem. \"[I] paced back and forth for 30 minutes in a walk-in freezer\" to evaluate its lining for warmth, recalls Berkowitz, 38. \"It's New York, so no one stops you, no one asks you. My face was cold by the end, but my body was totally warm. I remember thinking, 'OK, we're on to something.'\"At the time, Berkowitz was a commodities trader hoping to launch his own business. Today, Norwegian Wool's coats adorn the shoulders of billionaires, actors, politicians and financiers — at campaign events, during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in a Season 3 episode of HBO's \"Succession.\" The apparel brand was profitable in 2024, and has been for seven out of the last eight years, Berkowitz says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossBerkowitz declined to share other financials, citing competitive pressure — but says his company's products are now sold in more than 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and his appointment-only New York showroom.The appeal of Norwegian Wool coats is part form, part function. Financiers are expected to dress a certain way, but the classic wool Italian coats most of them wear aren't designed for sub-40-degree weather, says Berkowitz.\"If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's bestselling mid-length Euro Coats currently range from $1,545 to $2,945 each, depending on the type of wool used. The brand sells other lengths and styles, including blazers, sport coats, rain and ski jackets, and a variety of winter coat options and accessories for men and women. Roughly 40 billionaires have purchased Norwegian Wool coats, Berkowitz estimates.A luxury startup with modest rootsBerkowitz had the idea for Norwegian Wool while shivering on a subway platform with a friend in 2013, he says. \"I told him, 'I need a coat that looks good, that I could wear to work, that will actually keep me warm,'\" Berkowitz remembers. \"He put his arm on my shoulders, like, 'Dude, when you find it, get me one, too.'\"After doing some research, Berkowitz identified a simple culprit, he says: Many fashionable coats are designed in parts of Italy where the air rarely freezes. The average January temperature in Florence, for example, is roughly 40 degrees Fahrenheit — compared to 30 degrees in New York and 25 degrees in Chicago.Companies based in Canada and Scandinavia make warmer coats for harsher winters, but as one designer told him, the two industries \"don't talk to each other,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's showroom, located in New York's Midtown neighborhoodNorwegian WoolBerkowitz spent months flying to Italy and back to meet and woo factory owners, who'd ship prototypes to his apartment. He ultimately spent $250,000 — $50,000 of his own money and a $200,000 investment from the former CFO of his company, who'd heard about Berkowitz's efforts from a colleague — to sample the prototypes and order an initial run of 200 coats, he says.On nights, weekends and vacation days, Berkowitz carted those coats — one on his body and two in a small suitcase — to family-owned luxury stores across the U.S., he says. He often pitched directly to sales associates, who knew their clients' shared dilemma of wanting to feel warm while looking nice in a luxury coat, he says.He sold all 200 coats in three months and resigned from his day job in early 2015, he says.\"I didn't sleep much that year,\" says Berkowitz, adding that by day, he tried to hide his efforts to avoid jeopardizing his job. According to his former boss Alan Kestenbaum, now the CEO of New York-based holding company Bedrock Industries, he only ever came across as a \"street smart\" and eager employee who was \"the first to arrive and the last to leave.\"Like 'dipping your hand into warm butter'In 2017, Berkowitz landed his first partnership to sell coats at a major department store. The following year, Norwegian Wool participated in two fundraising rounds, both seven-figure deals with private investors, Berkowitz says. He remains the company's majority owner, he notes.Norwegian Wool coats are generally more expensive than Canada Goose parkas, and less pricey than cashmere coats from established Italian luxury brands like Loro Piana. But the quality of its materials is high, says \"Succession\" costume director Jon Schwartz: Norwegian Wool's cashmere feels like \"dipping your hand into warm butter.\"Berkowitz's dream for Norwegian Wool is a reputation akin to Range Rover cars — known worldwide for a blend of style and functionality, he says. He plans to add more product lines, invest in marketing and host pop-up retail events to improve the brand's visibility, he adds. Already, he's overheard Norwegian Wool come up in organic conversations, even when nobody realizes the brand's founder is in earshot, he says.If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done.Michael BerkowitzFounder and CEO, Norwegian WoolAnd as someone squarely within Norwegian Wool's target demographic — businesspeople who want to make an impression with their appearance during cold winters, he says — he still tests many of the company's prototypes himself.Berkowitz outfitted himself and his friends with not-yet-released parkas for a February ski trip in the Alps. He brought a sample of a recently released bamboo blazer to Paris in September, tossing it on top of his rolling suitcase and into the plane's overhead bin to test it for wrinkling and pilling, he says.\"I test things out going to my office in Midtown or in vacation to the Alps,\" says Berkowitz. \"It doesn't matter where it is, as much as how I'm wearing it. It has to be representative of how our customers would wear it.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

Gabby Jones | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesClose to half of Kalshi's user base experienced glitches and delays on Saturday during college football games, a major source of trades, as some said they were temporarily unable to process orders.In a message sent to a user obtained by CNBC, the predictions market service's website apologized for any inconvenience and said it was \"looking into\" the issues traders were experiencing. \"The Exchange is experiencing temporary delays,\" the message read. \"Balances and positions may not be accurately reflected at this time.\" One user shared a screen recording and screenshots with CNBC that showed they were unable to see their balance or bets while the issues persisted.A number of users on X reported the website was down when they were trying to place bets on college football games, with some saying they had open orders that wouldn't process. When CNBC visited the website, it wouldn't load, showing only a green K with a spinning circle around it for more than 20 minutes. The platform later loaded.\"Earlier today, Kalshi experienced minor glitches that temporarily affected some user experiences. No exchange outage occurred, no funds were affected, and the issues are now resolved,\" the company said in a statement.Earlier, a spokesperson denied there was an outage and said the exchange \"never stopped functioning properly.\" He added that there has been no impact on clearing, advanced trading, or institutional trading.\"There were some glitches and delays on our web and app product, which affected less than half of our user base,\" the spokesperson said. A little over a week ago, Kalshi announced a $300 million Series D funding round that valued the company at $5 billion, more than double its $2 billion valuation in June after its Series C round. The round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Sequoia Capital, with participation from Paradigm. Additional backers included Coinbase Ventures, General Catalyst, Spark Capital and CapitalG. The company, founded in 2018, rose to prominence by offering bettors the ability to trade on a wide range of real-world events, from football games to who President Donald Trump could pardon this year.WATCH: Kalshi CEO on $2B valuation: We’re one of the fastest growing companies in Americawatch now",

    "description": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults",
    "body": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge.To help parents facilitate that technological delay, Twenge recommends starting to teach kids how to use those technologies in safe and healthy ways at least six years in advance. Starting early helps prepare children to have healthier relationships with online technologies, aiding their development into well-adjusted, successful adults, she says.\"Ideally, it's great to have these rules in mind by the time your kids are in late elementary school, say, to be prepared. Because kids are getting these devices younger and younger,\" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" published on September 2.In her book, Twenge recommended against social media for kids until age 16, and wrote that children shouldn't have a smartphone unless they also have a driver's license and are expected to \"get around independently.\" Her rationale: Those technologies are contributing to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, such as anxiety and depression, she wrote.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossThose statements made headlines, particularly because many U.S. parents give their kids smartphones and social media access much earlier. In one recent Pew Research Center survey, more than half of U.S. parents said their kids between the ages of 11 and 12 already had their own smartphones.If you talk with your children about how to use internet technology responsibly before they turn 10, or younger if they already regularly use internet-connected devices like laptops, you can help them understand and internalize the potential downsides of excessive smartphone and social media usage, she says.You might, for example, discuss the types of personal information you shouldn't share with anyone online, from nude pictures to personal information like a home address or Social Security Number. You could talk about the value of privacy — reminding your kids to never assume a text or Snapchat message will remain private, and to not post any information or opinions online that they wouldn't be comfortable having announced over the loudspeaker at their school.Twenge also advises teaching children that \"your time is a precious resource,\" and that they might ultimately regret spending much of their youth absorbed in a device instead of engaging with friends and family in person, she says.The idea is to hopefully set them up to have a healthier relationship with those technologies as they age, says Twenge. But these conversations alone won't guarantee success, she says — because you need to do something else, too.Initiate healthy dialogue, 'then put the parental controls in place'Twenge's other top piece of advice: Set firm rules around how your kids can use devices and the internet, once you're comfortable with them doing so.One of the rules in Twenge's book bans smartphones during the school day and overnight in kids' bedrooms. Another of her rules states that that if parents want to give their child a device, their first phone should be a \"basic\" one — a phone that isn't connected to the internet, but does allow them to make calls and send texts to their friends and family.You could also use parental controls to guide kids' initial smartphone experiences, like setting daily time limits for usage to ensure kids aren't getting sucked into social media for hours at a time, or blocking adult-themed websites and apps.\"Teach them that moderation is key — and then put the parental controls in place to make sure you're not wasting your breath,\" Twenge wrote.Whatever you do, communicate your rules directly to your children, she says.\"We're going to have that conversation [and] be very clear about what controls we're putting on that phone,\" says Twenge. \"Even when she gets that smartphone, [for] one example, we're going to block app downloads, so then if she wants to put additional apps on it, it's a discussion, rather than her just doing it unilaterally, where we don't even know what she has on it.\"If your kids already have smartphones or social media, and you're starting to regret that decision, don't feel like it's ever too late to reverse those choices, Twenge notes. Just be honest and transparent about why they're making that decision, she says: \"Look, I made a mistake. I've learned more and we're going to do it differently going forward...\"Even if your teen's initial reaction is extreme — \"You might get some slammed doors,\" she notes — stay firm and try and put everything in perspective, she suggests. \"Tell them, 'Hey, you're still going to be able to text your friends. You're still going to be able to call me. And it's this or no fun at all.' That helps put it in context.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

Also adding to its charm are an evolving dining scene, growth in family-friendly offerings, community events and cultural activities, she tells CNBC Make It.Here are the top 10 hotspots for travelers in the coming year and how much search interest has risen from 2024:Big Sky, Montana, USA: 92% increaseOkinawa, Japan: 71% increaseSardinia, Italy: 63% increasePhu Quoc, Vietnam: 53% increaseSavoie, France: 51% increaseFort Walton Beach, Florida, USA: 45% increaseUcluelet, Canada: 44% increaseCotswolds, U.K.: 39% increaseSan Miguel de Allende, Mexico: 30% increaseHobart, Australia: 25% increaseOkinawa, a chain of islands with a subtropical climate in southern Japan, is the No. 2 trending destination for 2026, per Expedia searches.Travel to Japan surged in recent years thanks to a weak yen and lifted Covid restrictions, but some cities like Kyoto have introduced so-called tourist taxes to curb overcrowding. Meanwhile, Expedia recognized Okinawa for meeting its \"Smart Travel Health Check\" framework, aligned with World Travel and Tourism Council principles, for the region's efforts to offer cultural and natural experiences without the overcrowding seen in many major global cities.\"Expedia doesn't feel like it should or could be the arbiter of where travelers should visit or should want to visit, but we do play a role in informing travelers of what's happening in the places that they're making plans to travel to,\" Fish says about recognizing places that support sustainable travel practices.Kabira Bay, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan. The bay forms part of the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park.Sean Pavone | Istock | Getty Images\"What we see in Okinawa is that they are taking proactive environmental measures like coral reef restoration, they're moving towards a decarbonized economy by using renewable energy sources,\" Fish says. \"They're celebrating local heritage and making sure visitors have educational opportunities.\"Rounding out the top three is Sardinia, another rising destination beyond hotspots like Rome, Florence or Venice. The island is the Mediterranean's second-largest after Sicily and is sometimes referred to as \"the Maldives of Europe\" because of its beaches.Parts of the region are considered a \"Blue Zone,\" an area of the world where people tend to live exceptionally long lives, thanks to healthy lifestyle habits, access to fresh food, and focuses on strong social ties and spirituality.\"Sardinia is going to take a little bit more effort to get to than the destinations that we are so familiar with, like Rome and Florence,\" Fish says, but travelers are finding it worthwhile to enjoy the island's beaches, food and diverse landscapes.\"There are beautiful coastlines, but then there's a mountainous interior, and then those charming towns,\" she says. \"That's really the trifecta of what travelers are looking for.\"Photo taken in Bosa, Oristano, Sardinia, Italy.Ellen Van Bodegom | Moment | Getty Images",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "watch nowElectricity companies across the U.S. are struggling to figure out how much demand will actually materialize from the artificial intelligence boom, as the stock market speculates that vast sums of money will be spent on infrastructure to support a big data center buildout.\"There is a question about whether or not all of the projections, if they're real,\" Willie Phillips, who served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from 2023 until April 2025, told CNBC. \"There are some regions who have projected huge increases, and they have readjusted those back.\"The AI companies are rolling out ambitious plans to build server farms that in some cases would consume as much electricity as entire cities. But the tech industry is shopping the same big projects around to multiple utilities as they look for the quickest access to power.\"We're starting to see similar projects that look exactly to have the same footprint being requested in different regions across the country,\" GridUnity CEO Brian Fitzsimons told CNBC. GridUnity uses software to give utilities and transmission operators a clearer picture of where power projects are requesting connections across the patchwork U.S. electric grid.This data center shopping is making it difficult for utilities to determine how much power generation they will need to ensure the reliability of the electric grid. Electricity prices, meanwhile, are rising for consumers because power supply is already struggling to keep pace with demand.FERC Chairman David Rosner warned in September that the difference of a few percentage points in electricity load forecasts \"can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills.\"\"Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don't forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,\" Rosner said.Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez warned of the problem on the nuclear power operator's May earnings call: \"I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here.\"AI bubble fearsThe stock market, however, is not really pumping the brakes. The steady pace of big data center announcements is fueling one of the biggest rallies in power company stocks in two decades.The utility sector has gained about 21% this year after rallying more than 19% in 2024. The companies that supply the U.S. with electricity have gained nearly $500 billion in value over that two-year period. The last time utilities advanced more than 40% in consecutive years was in 2003 and 2004.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in August that the stock market is facing an AI bubble, cautioning investors that they were getting \"overexcited.\"While the exact magnitude of the coming demand is uncertain, experts generally agree that the U.S. is facing a historic increase in electricity consumption after a long period of flat growth. Existing data centers point to what is coming, Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, said.watch now\"We can see it. Data centers exist,\" he said. \"They're operating day in and day out, using a lot of electricity. It used to be the case a 50 megawatt data center was pretty big. Now, it's very common to have data centers that are 20 times that size — that are a gigawatt.\"Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm, estimates 120 gigawatts of additional electricity demand by 2030. This includes 60 gigawatts from data centers based on forecasts from the utilities. To put that in perspective, 60 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the 2024 peak hourly power demand of Italy, the world's eighth-largest economy.\"This is not a bubble,\" Fitzsimons said. \"It's going to transform our nation completely. It's going to continue to grow. We need a 50-year energy policy.\"But the utilities need to get firm financial commitments from the data centers, Gramlich said.\"That is going to help us rationalize all these requests and get a better handle on the total estimate,\" he said. \"But the industry's got to plan based on the best information we have at the moment.\"The uncertainty about demand forecasts has raised concerns that utilities could spend billions of dollars on infrastructure that is not needed in the end. The utilities spent $178 billion on grid upgrades last year and are forecasting $1.1 trillion in capital investments through 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute.Fitzsimons said the risk of the utilities overbuilding is lower than it was two decades ago due to constraints in the market.\"They're in a very different environment where we have massive supply chain problems,\" Fitzsimons said. \"We have inflation running off the hook for quite a long time now. They can't afford to overbuild. It's going to come down to better planning.\"Infrastructure constraintsA month after warning of a bubble, Altman struck a deal with Nvidia in which OpenAI would build 10 gigawatts of data centers with the chipmaker's graphics processing units. The plan requires as much electricity as New York City during the energy intensive summer days, raising questions about whether they can actually secure the power needed.It may be possible to secure that much electricity but the AI industry is facing constraints as their plans grow larger, Gramlich said. The companies are competing for scarce infrastructure, he said, which is increasing prices for essential electrical equipment like transformers, switches and breakers.\"We really don't have the electrical infrastructure to meet the aggressive targets,\" the analyst said. \"We don't have enough generation or transmission infrastructure to meet even the modest midpoint targets.\"The question is how fast new generation can be built, he said. Natural gas turbines are largely sold out through the end of the decade. The tech industry is investing in advanced nuclear power, but these technologies are not expected to reach commercial scale until the 2030s at the earliest.Renewable energy, meanwhile, can be deployed at the quickest speed, particularly solar and battery storage. More than 90% of the power projects waiting for a grid connection right now are solar, battery storage or wind, according to August data from energy consulting firm Enverus.\"For the past 10 years, our interconnection cues have been filled with a massive percentage of renewables,\" Fitzsimons said. \"The renewables are the fastest way to build out new capacity. There's no doubt in that because of the supply chain issues we have around natural gas turbines.\"But President Donald Trump opposes solar and wind while promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear power, raising uncertainty about whether enough new generation can be built. Utilities will turn data centers away if they do not have enough power available, Gramlich said.\"If they literally do not have the power to serve a customer, they're not going to sacrifice reliability,\" Gramlich said. \"That's their core job.\"Some AI companies believe they have found a solution — just build the power at the data center off the grid, called \"behind the meter\" in industry lingo.\"We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview on Oct. 8. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" he said.",

    "body": "A demo setup of racks of AI servers connected with Credo cables, displayed at the Open Compute Summit in San Jose, California.CredoIn July, Elon Musk posted photos from inside an xAI data center called Colossus 2, which the artificial intelligence startup aims to turn into a massive supercomputing facility in Memphis, Tennessee.Musk's pictures, posted to his X feed, didn't show off the pricey Nvidia racks that are filled with powerful graphics processing units. Rather, he focused on the wires behind the servers, including one image with thousands of neatly organized purple cables connecting the computers together.Those purple cables are the signature offering of Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company whose name rarely gets mentioned alongside the leaders of the AI boom.But Wall Street has taken notice.Credo shares have more than doubled this year to $143.61 after soaring 245% in 2024. The company's market cap, which was about $1.4 billion at the time of its IPO in 2022, now sits at close to $25 billion. Credo is angling to position itself as a key supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion, and is benefiting as the money flows downstream.The stock jumped 5% on Friday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $165 stock price. They said the active electrical cable (AEC) market, which Credo pioneered, is on pace to hit $4 billion by 2028, as all the major hyperscalers invest in data center buildouts.\"The industry outlook is supported by increasing deployments from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI as well as broadening adoption, including Meta and more,\" the analysts wrote. They predict annualized revenue growth for Credo of at least 50% through 2028.watch nowRevenue in fiscal 2025, which ended in early May, more than doubled to $436.8 million. The company also turned profitable, recording net income of $52.2 million after losing $28.4 million the prior year. Analysts are expecting sales to more than double again in fiscal 2026 to almost $1 billion, according to LSEG.Credo's purple AECs cost between $300 and $500 each, depending on bulk discounts and other negotiations, according to an estimate from the 650 Group, an industry researcher. They are sturdy, moderately thick copper cables wrapped in a braided covering with big connectors containing chips on each side.Much of the excitement around Credo is driven by the AI boom, which to this point has been driven by a handful of hyperscalers that are rapidly building data centers for future expected workloads. Analysts expect $1 trillion in spending on AI data centers by 2030, but any pullback from the major cloud providers or scaling back in OpenAI's plans could hurt many suppliers, including Credo.For now, projections are way up and to the right.Expanding opportunityPrevious servers typically had one or two processors on a motherboard. Individual servers today can have up to eight, and the most powerful AI models require potentially millions of GPUs all working together as one.Each GPU needs its own connection to the switch, the term for a computer that routes data around the cluster, often mounted on the top of a server rack.Nvidia's latest products slot several of these boards together to comprise a system with 72 GPUs. Next year's fastest racks will have twice as many, and the following year, a Kyber rack will have 572 GPUs, Nvidia says.\"In the past, Credo's opportunity was one cable per server, but now Credo's opportunity is nine cables per server,\" said Alan Weckel, an analyst at 650 Group. He estimates that Credo has 88% of the market for AECs, which are also made by Astera Labs and Marvell.Many GPUs are connected by fiber optic cables powered by components made by companies like Broadcom and Coherent. AECs offer an alternative to fiber optic cables. They have chips called digital signal processors on both sides that use sophisticated algorithms to pull data out of the cable, enabling much longer lengths than traditional copper cables. Credo's longest AEC is seven meters long.Credo CEO Bill Brennan, who joined the company in 2013, told CNBC that hyperscalers are choosing his company's cables because they're more reliable than fiber optic cables. He said customers are trying to avoid what's called a \"link flap,\" where one part of an AI cluster goes offline because the optical cable connecting them fails, costing hours of pricey GPU time.\"It can literally shut down an entire data center,\" Brennan said.He said Credo is increasingly working with hyperscalers in the early stages of planning large AI clusters, especially as some designs become denser, allowing more servers to be connected by shorter cables.\"When you connect with these hyperscalers, the numbers are very large,\" Brennan said.Credo's AEC leadership team, Hal Hawthorne, Don Barnetson, Ameet Suri, and Ryan Cai.Corey Bentley, CredoThe company doesn't name its hyperscaler clients, but analysts have cited Amazon and Microsoft as customers. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman posted an image on LinkedIn of the company's Trainium AI chip racks on Friday that appeared to show Credo's purple cables.Credo says it expects three or four customers to make up more than 10% of revenue each in the coming quarters, including two new hyperscale customers this year.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.At a conference for data center professionals in San Jose this week, Credo presented alongside a representative from Oracle Cloud. An example rack of Nvidia GPUs designed by Meta displayed at the show prominently featured Credo's purple cables.\"Every time you see a new announcement of a gigawatt data center, you can rest assured that we view that as an opportunity,\" Brennan told investors on an earnings call in September.It's a market that everyone in AI networking is targeting.Analysts at TD Cowen estimated earlier this month that the market for AI networking chips could be worth $75 billion per year by 2030. Major players include Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which both have their own networking businesses and have the power to dictate which technologies are part of their broader systems.'Insatiable demand'Credo was founded in 2008 by a group of ex-Marvell engineers, who developed chips for a relatively arcane technology called SerDes, which is used for high-speed chip-to-chip connections.Brennan's job, when he joined in 2013, was to commercialize the technology. The company raised its first round of venture funding in 2015 from investors including Walden International, which was run by Lip-Bu Tan, now Intel's CEO.Christina Locopo | CNBCThe AEC business didn't take off until the AI boom in the early 2020s, because data centers didn't yet need its technology, Brennan said.However, there was early excitement in the air when Musk's car company came knocking in 2017. Tesla wanted help with its Dojo AI supercomputer and needed chips with more bandwidth than what was available at the time.Now, Credo is hoping to use its foothold with its active copper cables to branch out into additional product lines, including intra-rack connections, or what's called \"scale-up\" networking. The company announced new transceivers and software for optical cables this week.\"You've got this market pull like we've never had before,\" Brennan said. \"If you could deliver the next generation right now, it would be consumed. Generation after that, it would be consumed. You've got this insatiable demand from the AI cluster world.\"WATCH: OpenAI in Abilene, Texaswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's extended rally, which has been driven by the company's increasingly central position in the artificial intelligence boom, hit pause on Friday, with the stock tumbling 7%, its worst day since January.The slide came a day after the software company revealed a long-term outlook, boosted by AI, at an analysts' meeting that was part of the Oracle AI World conference in Las Vegas.Oracle said on Thursday that it expects $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. The company now sees $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2030, which represents annualized sales growth of over 31%.The initial reaction was positive. Oracle shares rose 3.1% on Thursday, continuing a rally that's boosted the company's market cap by more than 160% in two years.But a hint of skepticism emerged on Friday, with some analysts questioning Oracle's ability to reach its lofty targets.\"It feels like the stock may take a bit of a breather here as investors digest those numbers and try to get comfort around the achievability of long-term numbers,\" Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's Seema Mody in an email.

It recently announced a five-year deal with OpenAI, worth more than $300 billion, to provide access to AI chips. Following its earnings report in September, the stock had its best day since 1992 as the company said it had $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.On Thursday, Oracle confirmed that it had a cloud deal with Meta, and said it signed up $65 billion in cloud infrastructure commitments in the current quarter. Oracle also said that its adjusted gross margins on AI infrastructure would be between 30% and 40%, higher than some analysts had expected.Karl Keirstead, an analyst at UBS, raised his price target to $380 from $360 in a note on Friday, and said the stock price doesn't reflect the entire upside of the company's AI-powered acceleration. The shares closed on Friday at $291.31.While he recommends buying the stock, Keirstead noted several things that \"more cautious voices\" will look at in his \"bear case\" scenario. They include the risk of concentrating business with OpenAI and \"various unforeseen go-live bottlenecks\" that could come with such an aggressive buildout, he wrote.Oracle's tone remains extremely optimistic. Clay Magouyrk, who was named one of Oracle's two CEOs last month, said at the conference that this quarter's commitments have come \"across seven different contracts from four different customers.\"\"None of those customers are OpenAI,\" Magouyrk said. \"I know some people are questioning sometimes, 'Hey, is it just OpenAI?' The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.\"WATCH: Oracle's cloud could catch upwatch now",

    "body": "If you or your child are hoping to attend college anytime soon, cost is likely top of mind. Top schools continue to increase tuition while many young adults fall deeper and deeper into debt. By the second quarter of this year, outstanding U.S. student loan debt topped $1.8 trillion, according to the Education Data Initiative.To keep costs down, prospective students could ideally win several scholarships. But that can be easier said than done.However, Carlynn Greene has done it — and she suspects you can too.Greene won 30 scholarships to attend both undergraduate and graduate school at the University of North Texas, graduating with no debt and degrees in broadcast journalism and public relations, advertising and applied communication.She's put those skills to use, working as a full-time content creator and the founder of Scholarship Guru, through which she's helped clients secure millions of dollars in scholarship awards.\"There are a lot of mistakes people make when it comes to scholarships,\" Greene says. Among the biggest, she says, is failing to put your best foot forward to in your essay.\"I always tell my students that you want to try and approach it as if you were marketing yourself, because a lot of the principles that we learn from marketing can be applied to scholarships,\" she says. \"Because you're trying to convince someone as to why they should invest in your education over someone else that's competing against you.\"Here's what Greene sees as the most common mistakes applicants run into when applying for scholarships — and how you can avoid them.1. Focusing on national scholarshipsIt's going to be hard for anyone — no matter how strong their essay — to stand out amid an enormous applicant pool, Greene says.\"Nine times out of 10, when people are starting out, they're applying for the ones that have very broad eligibility,\" she says. And while these national scholarships can come with five- or six-figure rewards, \"you are much more likely to win scholarships that are local, state level and also ones that I like to call intersectionality scholarships.\"By that, she means awards with multiple criteria that may describe you, including race, gender, geographic location and area of study. \"That will narrow down the competition pool,\" she says.2. Not treating yourself like a hot commodityGreene recommends imbuing your application materials with concepts from the world of marketing: scarcity and urgency. In essence, how are you or your academic goals unique — and why should you receive funding now?A medical student, for instance, may want to highlight that they plan to specialize in treating a rare and deadly disease, Greene says.\"If you find relevant data, like from a news article or research article that points this out and highlights it, that would communicate to the audience, the judges, that investing in your education makes more sense, as opposed to someone who perhaps is going into, let's say, plastic surgery,\" she says.3. Only applying to a handful of scholarshipsIt can be easy to get discouraged if you fail to win scholarships you were hoping for, but Greene says it can be a numbers game, even for excellent applicants.\"I won 30 scholarships, but I applied for a little over 100,\" she says. \"I've had another student, she won 20 scholarships. She applied for a little over 200. So it just depends.\"In addition to her website, Greene recommends using online tools such as Bold.org and Going Merry to find scholarships that meet your criteria and that you can apply for in bulk.Overall, for an average student, Greene recommends applying for anywhere from 100 to 200 scholarships.\"It can seem overwhelming, but when you compare it to even applications in the job market now, a lot of people are applying for hundreds of jobs,\" she says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samantha Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"",

    "body": "In 2011, I walked away from a six-figure law career and retired at age 41. I thought I was prepared financially. But emotionally? Not so much.After decades of working, I was used to the sense of purpose that came with a career, and I assumed I'd have to give that up once I stopped working. My biggest fear took the form of one major uncertainty: What would I do with all that unstructured time?Fast forward 14 years later, and my days are anything but idle. My wife and I now live in Portugal, the No. 1 country Americans want to move to. I spend my free time enjoying local food with friends and hiking the wildflower-dotted coastal trails. Retiring early is one of the best decisions I've ever made ... but I remember how overwhelming it felt at the start.Here's what I've learned so far in early retirement, and why I don't regret it.1. Uncertainty is an opportunity, not an obstacleI followed a predictable path for most of my adult life: law school, summer associate gigs, and eventually a stable legal career. Then came the 2008 financial crisis. The firm I worked for collapsed — and with it, my sense of direction. I couldn't picture myself doing anything other than practicing law.I could've stayed in the industry. But instead, I chose the unknown. Most people think early retirement is about not working anymore. But it's about redefining your identity without a roadmap. That required a mindset shift: I had to become an explorer.Ocean fog envelopes Sintra forest, within Portugal's Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, near Lisbon.Alex TriasThat mindset brought us to Portugal, a country where we didn't speak the language, didn't know anyone, and had no idea what to expect day-to-day. It was disorienting at first. But the uncertainty became our motivation to grow, learn, and build a fulfilling life from scratch.If you're delaying retirement because you don't know what comes next, that might be exactly why it's worth doing. Uncertainty could be your opportunity to travel down paths you've never imagined.2. You can still get ahead financially, even without a paycheckWhen we first retired, my wife and I assumed we'd gradually draw down our savings over time and hope it would last. But something surprising happened: Our net worth kept growing.A major reason is that living in Portugal drastically reduced our expenses. Here's what we save annually compared to our old life in Washington, D.C.:$15,000 on state income taxes$25,000 on health insurance and deductibles$14,000 on property taxes$20,000 on food, entertainment, and daily costsIn total, we estimate that we save about $5,000 per month just by living abroad.We follow the same financial strategy we did while working: We live below our means, reinvest the difference, and let compounding do the work. The only difference is that now, instead of salaries, our income comes from investments.Retirement doesn't have to be the end of building wealth. It can even be the beginning of a more sustainable, intentional version of it.3. Finding purpose in retirement is just as important as finding it in your careerWhether you're working or not, most of us want the same thing: to feel like we matter and are making a contribution.Coastal event collides against the rocks at Guincho beach, located on Portugal's Estoril coast.Alex TriasWhen we first retired, we had a built-in sense of purpose as parents to a young child. We joined school activities, studied the local language, and built a new life in Lisbon.But when our daughter went off to college, we were back to square one. Our schedules emptied out, and we faced the same question we did in 2011: What do we do with all this time?Before diving into hobbies or commitments, we made a plan. We identified six core priorities that bring meaning to our lives:Building and strengthening friendshipsPersonal care and physical healthQuality time as a coupleTravelVolunteer work and giving backLearning new skillsOnce we had those priorities in place, it became easier to build a routine that felt fulfilling.Today, my wife volunteers at our tennis club, takes pottery and Dutch lessons, and plays sports. I'm focused on writing, freelance retirement coaching, and helping a local nonprofit as a consultant. We host dinner parties, explore new recipes, and take short trips around Europe.With the right mindset, early retirement can be the perfect new starting point. You just have to be willing to embrace it.Alex Trias is a retired attorney. He and his wife have been living in Portugal since 2015.

    "body": "watch nowDespite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there's little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings.Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans.However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident.\"When we dig deeper here and look to see if there's a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence,\" Pinto said. \"Now that's what we're seeing today. That could always change. But if we look at the asset quality numbers that we've seen over the last several quarters, we're seeing very little deterioration at all.\"Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands.Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank's earnings conference call that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"\"One cockroach does not a trend make,\" Pinto said.In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. By comparison, during the 2008 financial crisis, defaults in high-yield debt were in low double digits.At the same time, the U.S. economy has proven stronger than thought, Pinto added, despite persistent worries about labor market weakness and the impact that President Donald Trump's tariffs might have on inflation and consumer demand.Pinto said he is at a conference this week with about 2,000 bankers \"and one of the words that I keep hearing is resilience.\"\"With respect to GDP growth, we're doing much better than many people thought just six months ago,\" he said. \"So again, the credit conditions, looking at GDP growth as well as an expected decline in interest rates, we feel the credit quality is in a pretty good place today and potentially may improve.\"Market sentiment appeared to improve Friday after a sell-off Thursday.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, which tracks the mid-market leaders, tumbled 6.2% Thursday but rose 2% in premarket trading Friday.",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Buffett's master class on the problem with goldThe price of gold slipped on Friday after hitting a record high above $4,300 an ounce earlier this week.It's still up more than 50% this year and has almost doubled since early last year.CNBC Pro's Fred Imbert notes gold is easily beating the S&P 500 this year, and turning in its best performance since 2008's financial crisis.He adds, \"What makes this time around so much more notable is that all the other instances of gold outperformance happened in bear markets for stocks or during major economic crises.\"Gold's incredible gains, and the modern ease of investing in the metal using ETFs, which may also be fueling some of those gains, have some strategists on Wall Street now saying that for many investors, the precious metal should play a role in a standard diversified portfolio.On Friday, CNBC.com reported that the traditional allocation of 60% stocks, 40% bonds is on its way out for many investors.In its place: a 60/20/20 split, with the bond bucket cut to 20% to make room for 20% in gold and bitcoin.Why?\"Stocks and bonds are moving in the same direction too often,\" the strategists say, \"while inflation, geopolitical risk, and government spending and high debt loads mean bonds no longer offer the protection they once did.\"watch nowWe haven't heard lately from 95-year-old Warren Buffett on the subject, but presumably he's avoiding the latest gold whirlwind.Over time, Buffett has always said gold is inferior as a long-term investment.At the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, he explained why, in responding to a question from a shareholder asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin:ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: The commodity market, and particularly gold, have appreciated astronomically over the last few years...Please explain why you have not invested more heavily in commodities...WARREN BUFFETT: [There are] three major categories of investment. And you ought to think very hard about which category you want to be in before you start thinking about the choices available within that category.Now, the first category is anything denominated in a currency. It could be bonds, it could be deposits in a bank, it can be a money market fund, it can be cash in your pocket.And the — if you will reach in your pocket — I don't like to do this, but — and pull out your wallet —You're watching an historic event. (Laughter)If you look at this — and, I might point out, this is a one [dollar bill]. Charlie [Munger, Buffett's long-time late partner] carries a [hundred] —On the back of it, it says, \"In God We Trust.\" And that's really false advertising.The -- if Elizabeth Warren were here, she would say, quite properly, it should say, \"In Government We Trust,\" because God isn't going to do anything about that dollar bill, you know, if government does the wrong things, in terms of keeping it as valuable as it was when you parted with it to buy a bond or put it in a bank.Any currency-related investment is a bet on how government now, and in the future, will behave...Almost all currencies have declined in value over time. I mean, it may be built into almost any economic system that it will be easier to work with a value of currency that declines in value than a currency that appreciates in value, and the Japanese might reaffirm that here with their experience.So as a class, currency-related investments, whether they are in the UK, or the United States, or anyplace else — unless we're getting paid extremely well for having them — we do not think make much sense.The second category of investments regard items that you buy that don't produce anything but that you hope someone will pay you more for later on.And the classic case of that is gold.FILE PHOTO: 24 karat gold bars are seen at the United States West Point Mint facility in West Point, New York June 5, 2013.    Shannon Stapleton | ReutersAnd I've used this illustration before, but if you take all of the gold in the world — don't get too excited now — and put it into a cube, it will be a cube that's about 67 feet on a side. That would be 165,000 or 170,000 metric tons.So, you could have a cube — if you owned all the gold in the world — you could have a cube that would be 67 or 68 feet on a side.And you could get a ladder, and you could climb up on top of it, and you could say, you know, I'm sitting on top of the world, and think you're king of the world.You could, you know, you could fondle it, you could polish it, you could do all these things with it. Stare at it. But it isn't going to do anything.All you are doing when you buy that is that you're hoping that somebody else a year from now, or five years from now, will pay you more to own something that, again, can't do anything, but you're hoping that the person then thinks that somebody else will buy something five years later from him.In other words, you're betting on not just how scared people are now of paper money, you're betting on how much they think a year from now people will be scared two years from then on...Steverts | Istock | Getty ImagesThe third category of asset is something that you value based on its — that it will produce, what it will deliver.You buy a farm because you expect a certain amount of corn or soybeans or cotton or whatever it may be, to come your way every year.And you decide how much you pay based on how much you think the asset itself will deliver over time. And those are the assets that appeal to me and Charlie.Now, there's some logical follow-on to that. If you buy that farm, and you really think about how many bushels of corn, how much bushels of soybeans will it produce, how much do I have to pay the tenant farmer, how much do I have to pay in taxes and so on, you can make a rational calculation, and the success of that investment will be determined in your own mind by whether it meets your expectations as to what it delivers.Logically, you should not care whether you get a quote on that farm a day later, or a week later, or a month later, or a year later.We feel the same way about businesses.When we buy ISCAR [an Israeli precision metalworking company], or we buy Lubrizol, or whatever, we don't run around getting a quote on it every week and say, you know, 'Is it up or down?' or anything like that. We look to the business.We feel the same way about securities. When we buy a marketable security, we don't care if the stock exchange closes for a few years.So, when we look at Berkshire, we are looking at what we think can be delivered from the productive assets that we own, and how we can utilize that capital in acquiring more productive assets.At that same meeting, Buffett acknowledged that \"rising prices create their own excitement.\"While \"people like to get in on things that have been rising in price,\" over time, \"that has not been the way to get rich.\"For Charlie Munger, it is \"peculiar to buy an asset which only will go really up if the world really goes to hell. It doesn't strike me as an entirely rational thing to do.\"Duracell 'Coppertops' hope to ease EV anxiety in the UKBerkshire Hathaway's Duracell subsidiary is bringing its famous \"Coppertop\" battery brand to EV charging stations in the United Kingdom.According to a news release, it has granted a license to Elektra Charge to set up and run a Duracell E-Charge network featuring chargers that resemble its 9-volt batteries.The stations will be developed and funded by The EV Network (EVN), which calls itself Britain's \"leading charging infrastructure developer.\"The Times of London quotes Mark Bloxham, EVN's chief development officer, as saying the Duracell brand will give \"familiarity and trust immediately to the consumer\" when switching to an electric car.EVN's CEO Reza Shaybani tells the Times, \"When you're a little child, with your toy car, you use a Duracell battery.

    "body": "George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for the sentencing in his criminal corruption charges at Central Islip Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, U.S., April 25, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.Santos \"was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison this year after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He began serving his sentence in late July.The 37-year-old New York representative served in the House for less than a year before he was expelled from Congress under a cloud of scandal in December 2023.Even before he was sworn in, Santos admitted lying about key details of his life on the campaign trail. While in Congress, he was charged by the Department of Justice with an array of federal crimes, including fraud, theft, money laundering and making false statements.Trump's decision to commute Santos' sentence came after multiple friends and allies of the imprisoned ex-politician made appeals for his clemency, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday evening.Trump had also recently read Santos' writings from prison describing his living conditions, the official told NBC.In a flattery-filled letter published Monday in local Long Island news outlet The South Shore Press, Santos directly asked Trump for clemency.\"You have always been a man of second chances, a leader who believes in redemption and renewal,\" Santos wrote. \"I am asking you now, from the depths of my heart, to extend that same belief to me.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who weathered heavy criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for saying he had \"served in Vietnam\" when he had never been deployed there.Trump had said earlier in October that Blumenthal \"should be investigated, and Justice should be sought.\" The attack came hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a combative and politically charged Senate hearing, directly accused Blumenthal of lying about his military record.Blumenthal said in 2010 that he had misspoken about his service on multiple occasions. On CNN last week, the senator said Trump's accusations are \"completely deceptive and distorted.\"Trump did not serve in the military after receiving five draft deferments during the Vietnam War.Trump wrote Friday that Blumenthal's record \"is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump wrote.\"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"Santos' attorney confirmed Santos was released from Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey at 11 a.m. ET on Saturday.",

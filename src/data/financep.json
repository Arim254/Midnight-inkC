    "body": "Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon delivers a keynote speech at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersQualcomm reported fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.00 adjusted vs. $2.88 expectedRevenue: $11.27 billion vs. $10.79 billion expectedRevenue rose 10% from $10.24 billion a year earlier, Qualcomm said in a statement. Due to an income tax expense, the company recorded a net loss of $3.12 billion, or $2.89 a share, after reporting net income a year earlier of $2.92 billion, or $2.59 per share.For the fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm said it expects revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.6 billion, or $12.2 billion at the middle of the range. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of $11.62 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted EPS will be $3.30 to $3.50, the company said, while analysts expected earnings of $3.31 per share.The company has long been a dominant provider of mobile phone chips, including the central processor and modem for high-end devices made by Samsung and modems for Apple iPhones.Qualcomm expects to lose Apple as a customer for its modem business in the coming years, and has been working to diversify by making chips for other devices such as Windows PCs and virtual-reality headsets and smart glasses from Meta.But the biggest opportunity is in artificial intelligence, where Nvidia has run away with the processor market and Advanced Micro Devices is trying to play catchup.Last week, Qualcomm announced that it will release new AI accelerator chips, a disclosure that boosted the stock 11%. Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.Nvidia and AMD offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.Qualcomm shares are up 17% for the year as of Wednesday's close, trailing the Nasdaq's 22% gain. Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, are up 45% and 112%, respectively.Revenue in Qualcomm's handsets business rose 14% to $6.96 billion in the latest quarter. Sales in the automotive unit increased 17% to $1.05 billion. Qualcomm reports its Meta revenue under its Internet of Things (IoT) division, which had $1.81 billion in sales during the quarter, up 7% from a year earlier. All three of those segments topped estimates, according to StreetAccount. Qualcomm's licensing business saw revenue slide 7% from a year ago to $1.41 billion, also beating analyst expectations.

    "description": "Dr. Sidrah Nisar was both excited and overwhelmed to land a $125,000 salary right out of veterinary school in 2019.\"I had more money than I could hand",
    "body": "Dr. Sidrah Nisar was both excited and overwhelmed to land a $125,000 salary right out of veterinary school in 2019.\"I had more money than I could handle,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Little did she know, she would soon be more than doubling that annual income by switching from full-time positions to contract work as a relief vet. Nisar's sister, who's also a vet, introduced her to an app called Roo that connects vets to clinics in need of coverage. Nisar started picking up shifts through Roo in May 2023 and left her full-time job in September of that year.\"I love being a relief veterinarian because I get to meet new people, talk to new people, learn new things every time I go into a new hospital,\" she says.In her full-time positions, Nisar worked 40 to 50 hours a week. Now, she works 50 to 60 hours a week, but on a schedule she can dictate, and with higher hourly rates. In 2024, Nisar earned $366,000 from shifts she picked up on Roo. She earned an additional $18,000 as a brand ambassador for Roo, plus another $2,000 from vet shifts she picked up outside of Roo to bring her total income for the year up to $386,000.Vets on Roo earn nearly twice as much per hour as the average full-time vet, and on average make $1,266 per day, the company says. Working full-time hours at that rate would easily help vets make more than the median $125,510 a year veterinarians nationwide earn, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Still, contract positions like the relief vet work Nisar does aren't for everyone. Here are three of the main differences to consider.1. Pay consistencyWhile a full-time position may come with rigid time-off policies or daily schedules, it also comes with a regular paycheck. Losing that guaranteed pay is \"the one setback of being a relief veterinarian,\" Nisar says.\"With being a relief vet, you kind of always have to be hustling and looking for work.\"Nisar credits the Roo app with making it easier to find shifts that work for her, but acknowledges the possibility that there could be a time when she struggles to find enough shifts to meet her financial obligations. For now, Roo has a lot of hospitals available in Nisar's area, \"so that's never a significant worry of mine,\" she says. 2. Work-life balanceWhen she worked full-time in animal hospitals, Nisar says she was \"consistently just thinking about my job when I wasn't at work.\"That quickly changed when she switched to relief work. Since she works at a number of different hospitals and may not return to some, Nisar is better able to separate what's happening at work from her personal life.\"My work-life balance has definitely changed since becoming a relief veterinarian,\" she says. \"I definitely am able to leave work at work and I don't bring it home with me versus being a full time vet.\"Like any workplace, drama and interpersonal conflicts can arise at animal hospitals where employees see each other every day and develop close relationships, for better or worse. As a relief vet, Nisar is largely able to stay out of any issues that can come up, or can choose not to return to hospitals where she doesn't enjoy working with the staff. \"[It's] significantly less stress,\" she says. \"When you're doing relief [shifts] you go in, you do your work, and then you leave.\"3. Mentorship opportunitiesWhile Nisar is happier doing relief work than she was in full-time positions, she doesn't recommend it for veterinarians just getting out of school because they still have a lot to learn that likely won't come as easily if they're bouncing from clinic to clinic.\"Doing that full time job and learning from your mentor is very, very important,\" she says. \"My advice to new vets is to do your full-time job first and having a mentor there and then stepping into relief [work] if that's something that you feel that would suit you best.\"And for experienced vets, Nisar says relief work still isn't right for everyone and you \"have to have a certain personality\" to be successful. \"You are going into a brand new clinic most of the time and you're meeting new people,\" she says. \"You have to be patient. You have to be flexible because you're doing what they want you to do. You're there to help them.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford hold a press conference at the U.S. Department of Transportation Headquarters on Nov. 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday afternoon that he will be reducing flight capacity by 10% at 40 major airports starting on Friday morning, affecting roughly 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.It was not immediately clear which airports would be affected.\"This is proactive,\" Duffy said in a news conference.Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said additional measures could be taken after the initial reduction.\"As we slice the data more granularly, we are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel, if we allow it to go unchecked, will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said on Wednesday.Bedford added that the administration will be meeting with the airline community to decide how to move forward on implementing the reduction, which he said has never happened before during his time in the industry.The government shutdown, which entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, is now the longest in U.S. history.Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time. \"We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,\" Duffy added.The move comes as air traffic controllers have missed their paychecks due to the government shutdown. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are among the essential government employees who are required to work during the shutdown.The closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Insufficient staffing at some FAA facilities has disrupted some flights since Oct. 1.Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he could \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown drags on.On Wednesday morning, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that it could take \"weeks to recover\" from the impacts of the government shutdown on air traffic controllers.",

    "body": "The Vogtle nuclear power plant is located in Burke County, near Waynesboro, Georgia in USA. Each of the two existing units have a Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR), with a General Electric turbine and electric generator, producing approximately 2,400 MW of electricity. Two Westinghouse made AP 1000 reactors are under construction here.Pallava Bagla | Corbis News | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars on Westinghouse nuclear plants could transform it into an independent, publicly traded company with the U.S. government as a major shareholder.The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.\"There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,\" Isaac said. \"Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.\"Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.\"We're going to keep all options on the table,\" Isaac said. \"This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.\"U.S. government financingThe government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from \"other jurisdictions\" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" the executive said.Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. The U.S. government is serving that role, the executive said.\"What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing,\" he said.",

    "body": "Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Lucid Group missed Wall Street's expectations for a second consecutive quarter as the all-electric vehicle maker continues to address problems with the launch of its new flagship Gravity SUV.The company, for a second consecutive quarter, also cut the high end of its annual production guidance to around 18,000 vehicles from a previous forecast of between 18,000 and 20,000 units. Its original target for this year was 20,000 units. It also reduced the low end target of its capital expenditures by $100 million to between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $2.65 adjusted vs. a loss of $2.27 expectedRevenue: $336.6 million vs. $379.1 million expectedLucid reported a net loss for the quarter of $978.4 million, or $3.31 per share, compared with a net loss of $992.5 million, or $4.09 per share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items including restructuring, the company lost $2.65 a share.The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was a loss of $717.7 million vs. an expected loss of $597.4 million, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. That loss widened year-over-over by 17%. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier.In addition to releasing its third-quarter results, Lucid said it has agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the company's largest shareholder.The company reported total liquidity of $5.5 billion to end the quarter, including the undrawn credit line. Its cash and cash equivalents were roughly flat from the end of last year at $1.6 billion, with a total financial runway into the first half of 2027, the company said.Lucid also said it continues to evaluate finance and liquidity options outside of the PIF as it launches its Gravity SUV and develops an upcoming midsize vehicle, which isn't expected to start production until at least late next year.An autonomous robotaxi from Uber's partnership with Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro.Courtesy: Nick Twork | LucidRegarding Gravity, Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said the company \"remains intensely focused on ramping up production and addressing the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the entire industry.\"During the company's last quarterly results in August, Winterhoff admitted there were problems with Gravity, saying the company planned to significantly increase production during the second half of the year.Winterhoff told investors Wednesday that the company continues to believe it can achieve a significant increase in Gravity deliveries during the fourth quarter, despite the supply chain issues and an industrywide slowdown in EV demand. Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said Gravity production increased quarter-to-quarter but remains at an unmeaningful level.The earnings results come roughly a month after Lucid reported third-quarter vehicle deliveries of 4,078 units, which increased from a year earlier but also fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations.Lucid has made several partnership announcements this year. In July, it signed a $300 million deal with Uber that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs over the next six years that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro. More recently, it announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia for autonomous vehicle technologies.Lucid's results are in stark contrast to fellow pure EV company Rivian Automotive, which on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and drove the stock price up during intraday trading Wednesday.Shares of Rivian — following near-record gains Wednesday — are up roughly 16% in 2025, while Lucid remains off more than 40%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split this summer.",

    "body": "Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 4, 2022. Mike Blake | ReutersDigital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion.The fundraise comes after a slew of acquisitions and as the company expands its product base beyond just payments.Crypto and digital asset companies are trying to take advantage of what is seen by the industry as a more favorable environment in the U.S. after the election of President Donald Trump and the passing of a landmark stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act.Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace.'Record year of growth'\"The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products,\" Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its \"record year of growth.\"Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company.\"We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future\" Long said.Ripple has looked to position itself as a fintech firm bringing crypto and digital assets technology to institutional clients.When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly.Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions.Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail.Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management.Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas.\"We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things,\" Long said.While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now.\"We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature,\" Long said.\"We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. We will continue to remain private.\"Ripple's funding comes as cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. This week, bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, with billions of dollars being wiped off the overall market.",

An internal portal for Microsoft's 200,000-plus workers now includes an option to request a \"Trusted Technology Review,\" Brad Smith, the company's president, wrote in a memo that was disclosed in a securities filing on Wednesday. It's designed for bringing up misgivings about the ways Microsoft builds and uses technology, he said. \"Our standard non-retaliation policy applies, and you can raise concerns anonymously,\" Smith wrote.The move comes weeks after Microsoft stopped providing some services to an Israeli defense unit. In August, The Guardian said the Israeli Defense Forces' Unit 8200 had built a system in Microsoft's Azure cloud for tracking Palestinians' phone calls as part of the country's invasion of Gaza, leading Microsoft to investigate the newspaper's assertions.Employees protested the company's work with Israel, leading to firings and resignations.Microsoft's business has been on a tear, with its stock reaching a record last week, as OpenAI and other companies have deepened their reliance on Azure for running artificial intelligence models. Yet there's been internal stress due to layoffs, return-to-office mandates and controversy surrounding Microsoft's contracts. A media report in July also described the U.S. Defense Department's dependence on Microsoft engineers located in China.Microsoft, which celebrated its 50th birthday in April, now sees opportunities to boost its governance.\"We are working to strengthen our existing pre-contract review process for evaluating engagements that require additional human rights due diligence,\" Smith wrote.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

Stephen Cohen | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least 11 people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday afternoon, including a young child.\"Right now these families need prayers, love and support,\" he said. \"Let's wrap our arms around them during this unimaginable time.\"Beshear said he expects the fatality count could possibly reach 12 by the end of the day and signaled the team is moving from rescue to recovery mode. Earlier on Wednesday, he said the plane hit two of the \"lesser populated\" businesses in the area.Beshear also urged residents and businesses around the crash site to not drink water and declared a state of emergency for Kentucky.\"It allows us to move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard,\" Beshear said. \"It allows state resources to be used also.\"UPS said in a statement that there were three crew members on the plane. Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to the crash site Wednesday to start investigating the incident. NTSB member Todd Inman said the investigation found that a plume of fire occurred in the plane's left wing during takeoff, causing the left engine to detach from the wing. He added that investigators have located the black box, or the cockpit voice recorder, at the crash site, though it suffered some heat damage.The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. It had about 38,000 gallons of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, officials said.Inman said it was too early to determine a probable cause of the crash and said there would more information as the investigation continues. He also said he expects the team to stay for at least week.Smoke rises from the site of a UPS cargo plane crash near the UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 4, 2025. Leandro Lozada | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Louisville Metro Police Department implemented a shelter-in-place order near the crash site Tuesday. Several businesses close to the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would cause an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The airport was closed Tuesday following the crash, and all departing flights for the evening were canceled. It reopened one runway Wednesday morning, and the airport encouraged travelers to monitor their flight status for delays or cancellations.UPS has its headquarters in Atlanta but the Louisville airport is home to its UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

Beauty | APHailey Bieber's cosmetics line Rhode is expected to increase E.l.f. Beauty's annual sales by $200 million this fiscal year, but its new parent company's full-year guidance still fell below expectations, leading its stock to plunge 29% Wednesday.E.l.f., which declined to release full-year guidance last quarter, is expecting full-year revenue to be between $1.55 billion and $1.57 billion, implying 18% to 20% sales growth. That's far below the $1.65 billion analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tarang Amin said Rhode, which the company acquired earlier this year in a blockbuster $1 billion deal, is expected to increase its annual sales by $200 million this fiscal year and by $300 million on an annual run rate basis.Rhode's expected contribution to sales represents about 13% of its revenue forecast, highlighting just how important the deal is to E.l.f's future as its outsized growth continues to moderate. It shows that E.l.f. needs Rhode to help it grow in the quarters ahead and without the acquisition, its potential for higher revenue could have been far slimmer.On the profitability side, E.l.f. expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.80 and $2.85, far below expectations of $3.58, according to LSEG. In addition to guidance, E.l.f. missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings in its fiscal second quarter results.Here's how the beauty company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 57 cents expectedRevenue: $344 million vs. $366 million expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $3 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with $19 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges, E.l.f. saw earnings of 68 cents per share. Sales rose to $344 million, up about 14% from $301 million a year earlier. Amin blamed the misses on revenue and guidance on the fact the company didn't release guidance last quarter, which he said can impact consensus estimates. \"We actually believe both the sales that we delivered, as well as the guidance on net sales, are quite strong,\" he said. E.l.f., which primarily sources its makeup from China, has seen its profitability crushed by President Donald Trump's new tariffs. During the quarter, its net income fell by a staggering 84% while the company said its gross margin fell by 1.65 percentage points, primarily driven by higher tariff costs. Amin said the second quarter is expected to see the greatest hit from tariffs and the impact is expected to moderate sequentially from there. \"In response to tariffs, we took our prices up $1, that was effective Aug. 1 so you're seeing tariff impact without pricing in this quarter,\" Amin said. \"In the second half of the year, gross margin will actually improve sequentially. In the absence of major product launches from its namesake brand, which Amin said are currently in the works, Rhode is E.l.f.'s primary growth driver and for now, the business is growing by about 40% year over year, he said.It launched in Sephora stores nationwide in September and was the biggest brand launch the retailer has seen in North America in its history, Amin said.\"It was two and a half times bigger than the number two, [Sephora's] second biggest launch ever, so it's performed extremely well,\" Amin said. \"We continue to see incredible potential for growth, not only in North America where we just launched and in the UK where we're about to launch, but also internationally. ... We definitely see global potential for that brand and see it being much bigger than it is today.\" ",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance has already informed Warner Bros. Discovery it believes its $23.50 per share acquisition offer is in the best interest of shareholders. Now it has to plan on what to do if the WBD board disagrees.WBD is openly for sale and intends to publicly announce its plans toward the middle or end of December, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The legacy media giant, run by Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav, is deciding whether to split the company in two, sell some assets or sell the entire company.Paramount has sent WBD's board multiple letters explaining why its offer is more valuable to shareholders than splitting the company, signaling negotiations could turn more aggressive if WBD chooses other options. CNBC has reviewed copies of two of the letters.A portion of a Paramount letter dated Oct. 13 specifically details the company's argument that its latest offer of $23.50 per share \"delivers superior value\" for WBD shareholders compared with any reasonable plan to break up the company.Roughly a week after receiving that letter, WBD said it would begin \"a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.\"The sale process was formally launched after WBD's announcement in June that it would split into two companies — a streaming and studios company to be called Warner Bros., which would include WBD movie properties and streaming service HBO Max, and a global networks company called Discovery Global, which would house CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, among other businesses. Both companies would trade publicly on their own.The strategic options aren't mutually exclusive. Given an expected yearlong (or more) regulatory approval process, splitting the company into two and then selling one or both parts would be the most tax-efficient way to sell, according to the people familiar with the matter. The split, expected to be completed by April, is a tax-free transaction.Comcast and Netflix have shown interest in acquiring the studio and streaming assets, CNBC has previously reported. If Warner Bros. Discovery decides its best value-creation path is to sell Warner Bros., it plans to make that announcement in December, before the split takes place, said the people familiar.Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said last week during the company's earnings report that such an acquisition would be complementary to its post-Versant-spin NBCUniversal business.Warner Bros. Discovery is scheduled to announce third-quarter earnings Thursday morning.Paramount's hostile decisionWarner Bros. Discovery has rejected three different offers from Paramount for a full takeover of the company. The last, for $23.50 a share, was comprised of 80% cash and 20% equity, CNBC reported last month.Paramount executives are willing to wait to see if Warner Bros. Discovery's board decides to engage in friendly sale discussions, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.But, if WBD stalls in its decision or decides to move in a different direction, Paramount has discussed taking an offer directly to shareholders and formalizing a hostile bid for the company, the people said.Warner Bros. Discovery asked Paramount to sign a nondisclosure agreement that includes a standstill provision that would prevent Paramount from launching a hostile tender offer in return for access to its data room, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount hasn't signed the NDA to keep its options open, one person said.Spokespeople for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount declined to comment.If Paramount appeals directly to shareholders, it will argue that its offer is superior relative to Warner Bros. Discovery's closing price on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. Warner Bros. Discovery closed at $12.54 per share on Sept. 10. A $23.50 per share offer is 87% higher than the so-called unaffected share price.Warner Bros. Discovery will have to persuade its shareholders that splitting the company or merging one of its units with another entity, such as NBCUniversal, is more shareholder friendly than an outright sale.Paramount has already laid out the math to Warner Bros. Discovery in the Oct. 13 letter obtained by CNBC. Here's the argument from the letter, addressed to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors and signed by Paramount Skydance Chairman and CEO David Ellison:\"We understand that you and your leadership team are optimistic about potential value creation from your planned break-up. However, a more objective analysis yields results meaningfully below the consideration to WBD shareholders in our proposal. We have analyzed the value of the planned break-up to WBD shareholders at the end of 2028 based on optimistic assumptions, including:Warner Bros. outperforming consensus EBITDA by ~$500 million (10%) and trading at the same multiple as Disney, despite the iconic global company that Disney represents across its businessesDiscovery Global achieving consensus EBITDA, despite meaningful headwinds, and trading at the media of analyst research \"sum-of-the-parts\" multiples for the businessAn illustrative 25-40% M&A premium applied to Warner Bros.Based on these assumptions, the planned break-up would generate a present value to WBD shareholders of less than $15 per share on a trading basis, or ~$18 to ~$20 per share including a robust, yet highly uncertain, M&A premium for Warner Bros.\"Paramount's assumptions aren't necessarily in line with WBD's or third-party equity analysts including Bank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich, who estimates a takeover $26-per-share value for Warner Bros. and a $4-per-share value for Discovery Global, according to an Oct. 21 note to clients. Regulatory uncertaintyParamount can also argue its deal for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery is well positioned to gain regulatory approval, given President Donald Trump's recent kind words about Ellison and his father, Larry, who is one of the world's richest people and who could contribute tens of billions of his personal money to help finance a transaction.\"I think you have a great, new leader,\" Trump said of David Ellison during a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview last week. \"I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership. I think it's the greatest thing that's happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.\"In stark contrast, Trump has repeatedly bashed Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, including calling him a \"lowlife\" and a \"slimeball.\"Some analysts have speculated Comcast could try to structure a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery where it would spin NBCUniversal and merge it with the studio and streaming assets.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.It's unclear if shareholders will be bullish on the future prospects of either Discovery Global or Warner Bros. as stand-alone entities.Discovery Global's collection of linear cable networks, such as TNT, TBS and CNN, faces declining advertising rates on top of annual cable subscriptions that are falling by the millions.Warner Bros.' HBO Max and the Warner Bros. movie studio may command a sizable M&A premium in a sale if Comcast, Paramount and Netflix are all potential buyers, but the price would have to be high enough to convince WBD shareholders that it's a better option than selling the entire company.Still, even if Paramount does decide to take an offer directly to shareholders, tender offers aren't guarantee to succeed.A threshold of just 20% of Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders who have held the stock for at least a year is needed to call a special meeting to potentially fight off a hostile bid, according to a company filing. Those long-term Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders may argue current management and the board are the best stewards of the company.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "watch nowBillionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht had some harsh words for the newly elected mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani. Sternlicht is Chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, which has both commercial and residential holdings and joint ventures in the city, as well as its own offices in Midtown Manhattan.Sternlicht blamed overly expensive development and management costs on unions and said he only expected it to get worse in the Mamdani administration.\"Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it's super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that's one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they're so difficult to add supply of housing to,\" said Sternlicht in an interview with CNBC Property Play, which will be released in full next week.\"And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don't have to pay. Well, you can't kick them out if they don't pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn't paying, and they don't pay, and the next guy doesn't pay, and then you're basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Mamdani's central housing platform focused on freezing rents, but Sternlicht, who said he did not speak with the mayor-elect before the election nor did he contribute to his opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, disagreed with his strategy.\"The core issues are not what he's focusing on. We need to increase housing. That's not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can't add economically.\"Sternlicht also expressed concern about public safety in the city.\"That's the number one thing. If people feel like their kids aren't safe on the streets, they will pull them out of school and they will leave. And if he defunds the police or he doesn't give them the honor and prestige they deserve, I think the city's in for a really tough time,\" said Sternlicht.He did say that he believes New York will survive, but will probably get a lot worse before it gets better. He said Starwood Capital is already considering vacating its New York offices, especially given what he called anger at success in the city, which was part of Mamdani's rise to power.\"Maybe he'll have, he'll learn from history. Maybe the million people that voted him won't realize that socialism has never worked anywhere on the planet Earth, ever,\" said Sternlicht.\"People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That's probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let's just tax everyone who's been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,\" Sternlicht added.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks at the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on November 5, 2025.Chandan Khanna | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday attacked New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani in a boastful speech doubling down on his policy agenda after Democrats won a slew of key elections across the country.\"If you want to see what congressional Democrats wish to do to America, just look at the result of yesterday's election in New York, where their party installed a communist as the mayor of the largest city in the nation,\" Trump said during the speech in Miami.Mamdani is a self-described democratic socialist who has rejected frequent accusations from Trump and other Republicans that he is a communist.The Democratic nominee on Tuesday night trounced his main opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who had been endorsed by Trump.Trump told the Miami crowd on Wednesday afternoon, \"We lost a little bit of sovereignty last night in New York, but we'll take care of it. Don't worry about it.\"Near the end of the speech, Trump said he may try to work with Mamdani, though he has previously threatened to cut funding to New York City if its voters elected the Democrat.\"Now let's see how a communist does in New York. We're going to see how that works out. We'll help him. We want New York to be successful. We'll help him a little bit, maybe,\" Trump said in Miami.'I don't think it was good for Republicans'Hours earlier, Trump conceded that the Democrats' electoral sweep up and down the ballot on Tuesday night spelled bad news for his Republican Party.\"Last night, it was, you know, not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas, but I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" Trump said during a breakfast meeting with GOP senators at the White House on Wednesday morning.\"I'm not sure it was good for anybody,\" Trump said. \"But we had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot, and we're going to talk about that.\"Trump added: \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor.\"\"And they say that I wasn't on the ballot, was the, the biggest factor,\" he said.Trump's reference to the government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, suggests he believes that the stalemate in the Senate is a political liability for the GOP.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsRecent polls show more Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, which has caused mass furloughs of government workers and threatened the funding for a slew of federal services.Trump stressed at the breakfast meeting, \"We must get the government back open soon, and really immediately.\"He went on to urge Republicans to terminate the Senate filibuster in order to end the shutdown and force through his policy agenda.Mamdani's victory was one of many Democratic electoral wins in the first off-year election cycle since Trump began his second term as president.Democratic candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill delivered resounding wins in their respective gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, with both projected to notch double-digit margins of victory.Jay Jones, the Democrat running for Virginia attorney general, defeated his incumbent rival, overcoming a major scandal involving texts he sent in 2022 musing about violence against a Republican political foe.After reporters and news cameras were ushered out of the breakfast Wednesday morning, Trump said that the electoral drubbing showed Republicans are \"getting killed\" and that the shutdown has been \"worse for us than for them,\" Punchbowl News reported.In his Miami speech hours later, Trump slammed the \"reckless Democrat shutdown.\"Publicly, some Republican leaders have brushed off the election results.\"What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue. We all saw that coming,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday morning. \"And no one should read too much into last night's election results. Off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.\"Vice President JD Vance in an X post said he believes \"it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states.\"But Republicans \"have to do better at turning out voters,\" Vance wrote. And they must \"focus on the home front,\" he added, emphasizing the issue of affordability, a key refrain for Mamdani and other Democratic candidates.Trump's initial reaction to the electoral results, which came as the votes were still trickling in Tuesday night, was to claim that his party underperformed because he wasn't on the ballot, and because of the shutdown.\"'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,' according to Pollsters,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. He did not provide a link to those polls.Trump, in follow-up posts, reiterated his recent demand that top Republicans move to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, rather than a simple majority.\"REPUBLICANS, TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER! GET BACK TO PASSING LEGISLATION AND VOTER REFORM!\" he wrote.Republican leaders have long opposed taking that step, known as the \"nuclear option,\" for fear that a future Democratic congressional majority would wield that power aggressively.But Trump wants them to nuke the filibuster in order to quickly reopen the government and enact more of his policy agenda, including passing sweeping changes to federal voting laws.He emphasized that view at the breakfast Wednesday morning.\"If you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation,\" he said.",

    "body": "Supreme Court justices on Wednesday expressed skepticism about the legality of aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump against most of the world's nations.Conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's method for enacting the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax.Lower federal courts ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority he cited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico.Sauer, who is defending the tariff policy as grounded in the power to regulate foreign commerce, said \"these are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue-raising tariffs.\"\"The fact that they raise revenue was only incidental,\" Sauer said, shortly after oral arguments in the case began.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's three liberal members, told Sauer, \"You say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are.\"\"They're generating money from American citizens, revenue,\" Sotomayor said.She later noted that no president other than Trump has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs since it became law in 1977.Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of six conservatives on the court, pressed Sauer on the fact that Trump unilaterally imposed the tariffs by citing purported international emergencies of trade imbalances and the flow of fentanyl into the United States, without Congress authorizing them.\"What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to take these powers back?\" Gorsuch asked.\"So Congress as a practical matter can't get this power back once it's handed it over to the president,\" Gorsuch said. \"It's a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's elected representatives.\"Other conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito — also pressed Sauer.The tariffs start at a baseline of 10% on many nations and spike to as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil.The tariffs, if allowed to stand, would result in $3 trillion in extra revenue for the United States by 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.That group last week said the federal government collected $151 billion from customs duties in the second half of fiscal year 2025, \"a nearly 300% increase over the same period in\" fiscal year 2024.Rick Woldenberg, CEO of educational toy company Learning Resources, which is involved in a case against U.S. President Donald Trump, stands outside the U.S. Supreme Court, as its justices are set to hear oral arguments on Trump's bid to preserve sweeping tariffs after lower courts ruled that he overstepped his authority, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 5, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersNeal Katyal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, opened his argument by saying, \"Tariffs are taxes,\" picking up the theme that multiple justices had raised with Sauer.\"Our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone.\"\"We don't think IEEPA allows this junking of the worldwide tariff architecture,\" Katyal later said.When Roberts asked him if tariffs implicated the power of the president to conduct foreign policy for the United States, as Sauer had argued, Katyal replied, \"We agree that tariffs have foreign policy implications.\"But he added that the Founding Fathers had delegated the power to tax to Congress in the Constitution.Katyal also pointed out that despite the argument that the reciprocal tariffs are being used to address trade deficits, Trump imposed a tariff of 39% on imports from Switzerland, an ally of the U.S., even though the U.S. runs a trade surplus with that nation.No other president has ever done something like that, he said.The Supreme Court, which heard more than 2½ hours of arguments, will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday.It is not clear when the court will release its ruling, but the Trump administration has asked for the decision to be expedited.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a court filing in September, said the U.S. might have to refund $750 billion or more if the Supreme Court ruled the tariffs are illegal and if it waited until next summer to issue that ruling.Bessent attended Wednesday's hearing.In a post on X later, Bessent wrote, that Sauer, the solictor general, \"presented strong, persuasive arguments on the necessity of using IEEPA tariff authority to confront the emergencies President Trump has declared.\"\"More importantly, the plaintiffs' attorneys, Neal Katyal and Benjamin Gutman, espoused arguments that reflected foundational misunderstandings and misrepresentations about the Trump Administration's trade goals,\" Bessent said.\"Showing their dramatic lack of economic understanding, Messrs. Katyal and Gutman argued that a President does have the authority to impose an embargo or quotas on other countries because those actions do not affect government revenues,\" Bessent wrote. \"Of course, they do. What embarrassing statements to make in front of SCOTUS.\"The case is seen as a key legal test for Trump, who has won some favorable rulings from the Supreme Court for other policies during his second term in the White House.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn a statement after the hearing, Victor Owen Schwartz, whose company V.O.S. Selections is one of the plaintiffs challenging the tariffs, said: \"For nearly 40 years, my family has built this business from the ground up. Today, reckless tariffs threaten everything we've achieved.\"\"Let's be clear: these tariffs aren't paid by foreign governments or companies,\" said Schwartz, whose company imports wines and spirits. \"It's American businesses like mine, and American consumers, that are footing the bill for the billions of dollars collected monthly by our government.\"\"Unlike past tariffs set by Congress that we could plan around, these new tariffs are arbitrary,\" he said. \"They're unpredictable. And they're bad business.\"Trump insists the tariffs are crucial to protecting the American economy and citizens. He says they serve as a sharp prod to companies to make their products in the United States.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, \"Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country.\"\"With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security,\" Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.\"Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,\" he said.\"A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.\"Critics of tariffs say their financial hit is borne not by foreign manufacturers but by U.S. importers who pay them and then largely pass on the added costs to American consumers.Trump previously said he was considering attending the oral arguments, which would have been an apparent first for a sitting president.On Sunday, he said on Truth SociaI, \"I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.\"It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Clara Shih, who's now head of business AI at Meta., speaks during the 2024 Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHubSpot announced on Wednesday that Clara Shih, Meta's head of business AI, has been added to the software company's Board of Directors.Shih joined Meta last year to lead its artificial intelligence product team, which develops AI tools for businesses, like its digital assistant dubbed Business AI, which debuted last month. She was previously CEO of Salesforce AI. While parts of the tech universe are seeing a big bump from the AI boom, HubSpot is in a corner of the market that's getting hit as investors worry about the impact of AI on future business. The company's stock is down 34% this year, compared to the Nasdaq's 22% gain, and analysts expect revenue growth to slow this year and again in 2026, according to LSEG. Like other cloud software companies, HubSpot is trying to infuse AI into the business, and convince Wall Street that the technology is poised to be a catalyst for efficiency and expansion. \"Clara is a remarkable leader who deeply understands both the transformative potential of AI and the realities of how go-to-market teams operate,\" HubSpot CEO Yamini Rangan said in Wednesday's release. \"Her experience building and scaling AI products, from foundational model platforms to customer-facing applications, will be invaluable as HubSpot continues to embed AI across our customer platform.\"Prior to serving as CEO of Salesforce AI starting in 2023, Shih ran the the company's Service Cloud unit. There she expanded generative AI capabilities with the launch of Einstein GPT and Agentforce, an AI agent developer platform.Before that, Shih co-founded Hearsay Social in 2009, serving as CEO until transitioning to the role of executive chairperson in 2020.\"HubSpot has a unique opportunity to help millions of scaling businesses harness the power of AI to drive growth,\" Shih said in the release. In February, HubSpot rolled out its own AI tool designed to help companies analyze brand awareness across AI search engines. The company said last week that it's acquiring XFunnel, a platform that helps businesses optimize their presence on AI search engines.WATCH: HubSpot CEO talks new AI agent toolswatch now",

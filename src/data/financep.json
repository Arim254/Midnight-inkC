Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump underwent an MRI in October to evaluate his cardiovascular and abdominal health, and the resulting images were \"perfectly normal,\" the White House physician said Monday.The results of Trump's magnetic resonance imaging were released a day after the 79-year-old president told reporters that he had \"no idea\" which part of his body was scanned, and three days after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded to Trump calling him \"seriously r-----ed\" by saying, \"release the MRI results.\"\"Has anyone in the history of the world ever had an MRI assigned to them and have no idea what it was for, as he says?\" Walz said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, said Monday that the advanced imaging at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was part of a \"comprehensive executive physical, and was ordered because men in his age group \"benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.\" Barbabella described the imaging as routine and preventative, meant to identify potential issues early and confirm overall function. Barbabella also said the cardiovascular imaging showed no signs of arterial narrowing, impaired blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels.Barbabella found that the heart chambers were normal in size, the vessel walls appeared smooth and healthy, and there was no indication of inflammation or clotting. The doctor also reported that all major organs appeared healthy and well-perfused, with no acute or chronic concerns detected.Barbabella described the president's cardiovascular system as being in \"excellent health.\" The White House did not release images of the tests.Until Monday, the White House had only described Trump's Walter Reed visit as a \"follow-up evaluation\" that included \"advanced imaging,\" without saying why the procedure was done.",

Giuseppe Cacace | Afp | Getty ImagesBoeing is continuing to express optimism about its business as the company wraps up the year and looks at 2026.Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said Tuesday at a UBS conference that the company expects deliveries for both its 737 jets and 787 jets to be up next year.\"When you now fast forward to 2026, we're going to be increasing our deliveries,\" Malave said. Boeing stock rose more than 7% in early trading Tuesday after Malave's comments.He added that he expects the certification for the 737-10 aircraft, which is years behind schedule, to come later in 2026. The bolstered deliveries will be \"a big driver\" of cash flow as well, Malave said, with positive free cash flow expected to be in the billions in the \"low single digits.\" Boeing hasn't turned an annual profit since 2018.Malave also said the company expects that cash margins will get a \"pretty significant boost\" through 2030 due to the higher productivity.Boeing has been seeing an upward trend after a period of increased scrutiny following the blowout of a door plug on a flight in January 2024. In July, CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company was beginning to see changes in its business, including slashing its quarterly losses. Boeing saw a strong delivery pace in October, putting it on track for its highest annual delivery total since 2018. The company said its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years in October. Those deliveries follow a lifting of restrictions by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing the company to sign off on some of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner planes before they reach customers.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesElon Musk has again sounded the alarm on the dangers of AI and listed what he considers as the three most important ingredients to ensure a positive future with the technology. The billionaire CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X and The Boring Company, appeared on a podcast with Indian billionaire Nikhil Kamath on Sunday.\"It's not that we're guaranteed to have a positive future with AI,\" Musk said on the podcast. \"There's some danger when you create a powerful technology, that a powerful technology can be potentially destructive.\" Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI alongside Sam Altman, but left its board in 2018 and publicly criticized the company for ditching its founding mission as a non-profit to develop AI safely after it launched ChatGPT in 2022. Musk's xAI developed its own chatbot, Grok, in 2023. Musk has previously warned that \"one of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI,\" and stressed that rapid advancements are leading AI to become a bigger risk to society than cars or planes or medicines.On the podcast, the tech billionaire emphasized the importance of ensuring AI technologies pursue truth instead of repeating inaccuracies. \"That can be very dangerous,\" Musk told Kamath, who is also the co-founder of retail stockbroker Zerodha.\"Truth and beauty and curiosity. I think those are the three most important things for AI,\" he said. He said that, without strictly adhering to truths, AI will learn information from online sources where it \"will absorb a lot of lies and then have trouble reasoning because these lies are incompatible with reality.\" He added: \"You can make an AI go insane if you force it to believe things that aren't true because it will lead to conclusions that are also bad.\"\"Hallucination\" — responses that are incorrect or misleading — is a major challenge facing AI. Earlier this year, an AI feature launched by Apple on its iPhones generated fake news alerts.These included a false summary from the BBC News app notifications on a story about the PDC World Darts Championship semi-final, where it wrongly claimed that the British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship. Littler did not win the tournament's final until the next day. Apple told the BBC at the time that it was working on an update to resolve the problem which clarifies when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text shown in the notifications. Musk added that \"some appreciation of beauty is important\" and that \"you know it when you see it.\" Musk said AI should want to know more about the nature of reality because humanity is more interesting than machines.\"It's more interesting to see the continuation if not the prosperity of humanity than to exterminate humanity,\" he said. Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist and ex-vice president at Google known as a \"Godfather of AI,\" said earlier this year that there's a \"10% to 20% chance\" that AI will \"wipe us out,\" in an episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast. Some of the shorter term risks he cited included hallucinations and the automation of entry level jobs.\"The hope is that if enough smart people do enough research with enough resources, we'll figure out a way to build them so they'll never want to harm us,\" Hinton added.",

    "body": "Nvidia-backed video generation startup Luma AI is joining a growing wave of U.S. tech companies launching operations in the U.K., with major plans for a London expansion revealed on Tuesday.The Palo Alto-headquartered startup will look to hire around 200 employees — making up around 40% of its workforce — at its new London base by early 2027, across research, engineering, partnerships and strategic development. The expansion comes two weeks on from Luma announcing a $900 million funding round led by Saudi Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, which saw it hit a valuation upwards of $4 billion. The startup previously received backing from Nvidia. Luma is building \"world models,\" a class of AI models that are able to learn from video, audio and images, alongside text, and which large language models (LLMs) like those powering OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini use. The startup is currently targeting marketing, advertising, media and entertainment sectors with its video models, which it sells via an application programming interface (API) and as part of a content creation suite.\"With this Series C raise and the upcoming build-out of global compute infrastructure, we have the capital and capacity to bring world-scale AI to creatives everywhere,\" said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. \"Launching across Europe and the Middle East is the logical next step in putting this power directly in the hands of storytellers, agencies and brands globally.\"The U.K. is the starting point of the expansion because of its access to talent, Jain told CNBC.\"London has some of the best people when it comes to research, given the universities here and institutions like DeepMind,\" he said. \"We also consider London to be the entry point to the European market.\"AI generated image created by Luma's Ray3 model (Luma AI)Luma AILuma is the latest in a wave of North American AI labs doubling down on the U.K. and Europe as they look to take advantage of talent pools and revenue opportunities.In November, San Francisco-based Anthropic announced plans to open offices in Paris and Munich, months on from kicking off a hiring spree in London and Dublin. Canadian AI startup Cohere said it would open a Paris office to become its EMEA headquarters in September and OpenAI announced a new office in Munich in February.While world models may not yet be as developed as LLMs, some researchers say they are as, if not more, crucial in the pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).\"These kinds of visual models are about a year to a year-and-a-half behind language models right now,\" said Jain. But world models will become the \"natural interface\" for AI for most day-to-day use in time, he predicted, pointing to the amount of time people spend watching video content each day. Tech giants including Google, Meta and Nvidia are all developing world models for a range of use cases.Luma released its latest model, Ray3, in September, which Jain told CNBC benchmarks higher than OpenAI's Sora and at similar levels to Google's Veo 3.",

Speaking via teleconference, Son and OpenAI chief Sam Altman argued that advancing artificial intelligence would lead to new jobs that are not yet imagined, and the advancement of robotics will help kickstart a \"self-improvement\" loop. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son on Monday downplayed the decision to offload the conglomerate's entire Nvidia stake, saying he \"was crying\" over parting with the shares. Speaking at a forum in Tokyo Monday, Son addressed SoftBank's November disclosure that the firm had sold its holding in the American chip darling for $5.83 billion. According to Son, SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, including a big bet on OpenAI and data center projects. \"I don't want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects, Son said during the FII Priority Asia forum. \"I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.\"Son's comments are consistent with what analysts and other Softbank executives said in November, describing the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster SoftBank Vision Fund's AI war chest. SoftBank has doubled down on its AI plans this year with a series of projects, including work on Stargate Project data centers and the acquisition of U.S. chip designer Ampere Computing.The Japanese giant could also \"potentially\" increase its investment in OpenAI depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said that SoftBank was \"all in\" on OpenAI and predicted the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. So far, that bet has reaped some dividends, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.However, SoftBank's massive AI bets come amid growing fears and jitters in markets about a potential AI bubble. In his Monday talk, Son also pushed back against these concerns, arguing that those who talk about an AI bubble are \"not smart enough.\"He predicted that \"super [artificial] intelligence\" and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment into the technology.",

Trump last month appeared to soften his stance on H1-B visas, saying in an interview to Fox News that foreign labor was needed at times because U.S. did not have \"certain talents.\" \"I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B program,\" Musk said, adding that it would be \"very bad.\" watch nowMusk, whose relationship with the U.S. president appears to be on the mend having soured in May over Trump's spending bill, also raised concerns over the U.S. administration's tariff policy. Once a close aid of Trump, Musk said he tried to dissuade the president from taking the tariff route, but was unsuccessful.\"I think generally free trade is better\" Musk said, adding that tariffs create distortions in markets. If tariffs at an individual level, or within each state of U.S. would be disastrous for the economy, \"then why do you want tariffs between countries?\" he said.The Tesla CEO, who spearheaded the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency that was recently disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, according to Reuters, said \"the president has made it clear he loves tariffs.\"Trump has levied \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with several managing to strike a deal with the U.S. to lower levies.In the podcast with Kamath covering a wide range of topics, Musk also laid out his vision for the future, forecasting that working will be optional in less than 20 years and money as a concept would \"disappear.\"Energy is the true currency, Musk said. \"This is why I said bitcoin is based on energy. You can't legislate energy.\" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a sharp sell-off over the past two months as investor mood sours on digital assets.",

    "body": "John Giannandrea.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's AI chief is stepping down, the company announced Monday in the most visible shake up yet to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence group since launching its Apple Intelligence suite in 2024.John Giannandrea, who held the position since joining the company in 2018, will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft and was previously part of Google's DeepMind AI unit, according to his LinkedIn profile. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He will continue to serve as an advisor until retiring next spring, Apple said.The change comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence, a tech field that has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022.Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026, signaling development challenges. Subramanya will serve as Apple's vice president of AI, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi, the company said.In a statement, Cook said Federighi has already been playing a key role in Apple's AI efforts.\"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams working on Apple's foundation models, research and AI safety. Other teams previously under Giannandrea will move under COO Sabih Khan and services chief Eddy Cue, Apple said.Although Apple shares are up 16% in 2025, they have lagged many other big tech companies as investors say the iPhone maker has fallen behind its peers that are investing billions into AI data centers, chips and frontier models.Apple said in August that it was \"significantly increasing\" the amount it spends on AI, and Cook has said it's a \"profound\" technology. Apple has struck a deal with leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, like Siri.But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It's spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. Apple also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud.Apple this year also saw Jony Ive, its legendary hardware designer who helped late co-founder Steve Jobs invent the iPhone, sell his startup io for $6.4 billion to OpenAI, with the intention of helping the AI lab release its own hardware.Analysts say that Apple has built a loyalty moat among its customers since the iPhone launched in 2007, but AI-driven hardware is on its way, with Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month saying that they've already completed their first prototypes and could reveal them in two years or less.WATCH: Apple will gain more AI functionality over time, says D.A.

    "body": "Attendees pass an Amazon Web Services logo during AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas on Dec. 3, 2024.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesAmazon has found a way to let cloud clients extensively customize generative AI models. The catch is that the system costs $100,000 per year.The Nova Forge offering from Amazon Web Services gives organizations access to Amazon's AI models in various stages of training so they can incorporate their own data earlier in the process. Already, companies can fine-tune large language models after they've been trained. The results with Nova Forge will lean more heavily on the data that customers supply. Nova Forge customers will also have the option to refine open-weight models, but training data and computing infrastructure are not included. Organizations that assemble their own models might end up spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, which means using Nova Forge is more affordable, Amazon said.AWS released its own models under the Nova brand in 2024, but they aren't the first choice for most software developers. A July survey from Menlo Ventures said that by the middle of this year, Amazon-backed Anthropic controlled 32% of the market for enterprise LLMs, followed by OpenAI with 25%, Google with 20% and Meta with 9% — Amazon Nova had a less than 5% share, a Menlo spokesperson said.The Nova models are available through AWS' Bedrock service for running models on Amazon cloud infrastructure, as are Anthropic's Claude 4.5 models.\"We are a frontier lab that has focused on customers,\" Rohit Prasad, Amazon head scientist for artificial general intelligence, told CNBC in an interview. \"Our customers wanted it. We have invented on their behalf to make this happen.\"Nova Forge is also in use by internal Amazon customers, including teams that work on the company's stores and the Alexa AI assistant, Prasad said. Reddit needed an AI model for moderating content that would be sophisticated about the many subjects people discuss on the social network. Engineers found that a Nova model enhanced with Reddit data through Forge performed better than commercially available large-scale models, Prasad said. Booking.com, Nimbus Therapeutics, the Nomura Research Institute and Sony are also building models with Forge, Amazon said.Organizations can request that Amazon engineers help them build their Forge models, but that assistance is not included in the new service's $100,000 annual fee.AWS is also introducing new models for developers at its Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning model whose tests show it performs at least as well as Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI's GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro Preview, Amazon said. Reasoning involves running a series of computations that might take extra time in response to requests to produce better answers. Nova 2 Pro will be available in early access to AWS customers with Forge subscriptions, Prasad said. That means Forge customers and Amazon engineers will be able to try Nova 2 Pro at the same time. Nova 2 Omni is another reasoning model that can process incoming images, speech, text and videos, and it generates images and text. It's the first reasoning model with that range of capability, Amazon said. Amazon hopes that, by delivering a multifaceted model, it can lower the cost and complexity of incorporating AI models into applications.Tens of thousands of organizations are using Nova models each week, Prasad said. AWS has said it has millions of customers. Nova is the second-most popular family of models in Bedrock, Prasad said. The top group of models are from Anthropic.WATCH: Amazon set to kick off AI conference next week: Maxim's Tom Forte on what to expectwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowMongoDB shares ripped 25% higher on Tuesday after the company blew past Wall Street's third-quarter expectations and lifted its forecast as its cloud database platform gained traction with customers. The database software provider posted adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share on $628 million in revenue. That topped the 80 cents adjusted per share and $592 million in revenue expected by analysts polled by LSEG. Revenues grew 19% from last year.MongoDB said its Atlas platform grew 30% from a year ago and accounted for 75% of total revenues for the quarter. The company said it ended the period with more than 60,800 Atlas customers, with revenues  expected to grow 27% for the platform in the current period.\"Q3 was an exceptional quarter that was driven by our continued go-to-market execution and the broad-based demand we are seeing across business,\" said CEO Chirantan \"CJ\" Desai in his first earnings call at the helm of the company.

Citing those tailwinds, MongoDB boosted its guidance for the full year on Atlas growth and tailwinds from ongoing artificial intelligence demand. The company now anticipates revenues between $2.434 billion and $2.439 billion, up from prior guidance of $2.34 billion and $2.36 billion. Analysts at Bernstein lifted their price target on shares to $452, expecting the stock to continue benefiting from accelerating growth as other software companies struggle.  \"We expect strong consumption demand, potential upside from AI, and benefits from an easing interest rate environment to continue driving re-rating upside in the near term,\" they wrote.

    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAmazon's cloud unit on Tuesday announced AI-enabled software designed to help clients better understand and recover from outages. DevOps Agent, as the artificial intelligence tool from Amazon Web Services is called, predicts the cause of technical hiccups using input from third-party tools such as Datadog and Dynatrace. AWS said customers can sign up to use the tool Tuesday in a preview, before Amazon starts charging for the service.The AI outage tool from AWS is intended to help companies more quickly figure out what caused an outage and implement fixes, Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS, told CNBC. It's what site reliability engineers, or SREs, do at many companies that provide online services. SREs try to prevent downtime and jump into action during live incidents. Startups such as Resolve and Traversal have started marketing AI assistants for these experts. Microsoft's Azure cloud group introduced an SRE Agent in May.Rather than waiting for on-call staff members to figure out what happened, the AWS DevOps Agent automatically assigns work to agents that look into different hypotheses, Sivasubramanian said.\"By the time the on-call ops team member dials in, they have an incident report with preliminary investigation of what could be the likely outcome, and then suggest what could be the remediation as well,\" Sivasubramanian told CNBC ahead of AWS' Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tested the AWS DevOps Agent. In under 15 minutes, the software found the root cause of an issue that would have taken a veteran engineer hours, AWS said in a statement.The tool relies on Amazon's in-house AI models and those from other providers, a spokesperson said.AWS has been selling software in addition to raw infrastructure for many years. Amazon was early to start renting out server space and storage to developers since the mid-2000s, and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Oracle have followed.Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, these cloud infrastructure providers have been trying to demonstrate how generative AI models, which are often training in large cloud computing data centers, can speed up work for software developers.Over the summer, Amazon announced Kiro, a so-called vibe coding tool that produces and modifies source code based on user text prompts. In November, Google debuted similar software for individual software developers called Antigravity, and Microsoft sells subscriptions to GitHub Copilot.WATCH: Amazon rolls out AI-powered tools to help big AWS customers update old softwarewatch now",

Zafran uses artificial intelligence and automation technology to manage threat exposure.It's \"becoming much more severe than it was even a year ago,\" she said in an exclusive interview. The round brings Zafran's total funding to $130 million since its founding in 2022. Zafran did not disclose the valuation at which it raised, but the startup said it has more than tripled annual recurring revenue since its last round for $70 million in September 2024. Annual recurring revenue is a term often used to measure income expected on a 12-month basis for a product. The company plans to use the money to hire more people, Yashar said.Menlo Ventures led the funding round, with participation from Sequoia Capital and Cyberstarts, which was an early investor in the startup Wiz that sold to Google for $32 billion in March. Companies are looking for ways to reinvigorate their cybersecurity capabilities as AI reshapes the sophistication and capabilities of cyber criminals. Besides Wiz, Palo Alto Networks in July announced that it acquired identity security provider CyberArk for $25 billion. Yashar and co-founders Ben Seri and Snir Havdala created Zafran following an investigation into a ransomware attack on a hospital in Israel. \"The data was there,\" Yashar told CNBC, adding that cohesive security tools might have prevented the attack. \"If the security tools were talking to each other, they could block it.\"Yashar, who moved to Israel from Tehran at 17, served for 15 years in an elite cybersecurity intelligence unit within the Israel Defense Forces known as Unit 8200. She also led major investigations at threat detection firm FireEye and Mandiant, which Google bought in 2022. Many famous cybersecurity companies have originated from Unit 8200 alum, including Palo Alto Networks, Check Point Software and CyberArk. Zafran customers include healthcare, financial services, insurance, technology and Fortune 500 companies, Yashar said.

    "body": "watch nowCostco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs it paid so far this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be collected from the retail warehouse club giant as a Supreme Court case plays out.In the suit filed Friday, Costco said that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds earlier lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could prevent the tariffs that it has already paid on an estimated basis from being refunded. Costco did not say how much money it believes should be refunded to the company.Costco's suit, filed in the U.S Court of International Trade, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied the company's request to extend the Dec. 15 date of so-called liquidation, the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items. While an importer has six months to file a protest contesting liquidation, \"not all liquidations are protestable,\" the suit said.A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on imports from many U.S. trading partners and his so-called fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China, and Mexico.Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those often high tariffs. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling, upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade that found Trump did not have that power.\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the Federal Circuit said in its ruling. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"During oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices appeared skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for the Trump administration that the president did have the power to impose the tariffs.The Supreme Court took the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings on an expedited basis, but it is not clear when or how the court will decide the dispute.Costco, in its lawsuit, said, \"This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA YouTube tool that uses creators' biometrics to help them remove AI-generated videos that exploit their likeness also allows Google to train its artificial intelligence models on that sensitive data, experts told CNBC.In response to concern from intellectual property experts, YouTube told CNBC that Google has never used creators' biometric data to train AI models and it is reviewing the language used in the tool's sign-up form to avoid confusion. But YouTube told CNBC it will not be changing its underlying policy. The discrepancy highlights a broader divide inside Alphabet, where Google is aggressively expanding its AI efforts while YouTube works to maintain trust with creators and rights holders who depend on the platform for their businesses.YouTube is expanding its \"likeness detection,\" a tool the company introduced in October that flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes, the term used to describe fake videos created using AI. The feature is being expanded to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program as AI-manipulated content becomes more prevalent throughout social media.The tool scans videos uploaded across YouTube to identify where a creator's face may have been altered or generated by artificial intelligence. Creators can then decide whether to request the video's removal, but to use the tool, YouTube requires that creators upload a government ID and a biometric video of their face. Biometrics are the measurement of physical characteristics to verify a person's identity.Experts say that by tying the tool to Google's privacy policy, YouTube has left the door open for future misuse of creators' biometrics. The policy states that public content, including biometric information, can be used \"to help train Google's AI models and build products and features.\"\"Likeness detection is a completely optional feature, but does require a visual reference to work,\" YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in a statement to CNBC. \"Our approach to that data is not changing. As our Help Center has stated since the launch, the data provided for the likeness detection tool is only used for identity verification purposes and to power this specific safety feature.\"YouTube told CNBC it is \"considering ways to make the in-product language clearer.\" The company has not said what specific changes to the wording will be made or when they will take effect. Experts remain cautious, saying they raised concerns about the policy to YouTube months ago.\"As Google races to compete in AI and training data becomes strategic gold, creators need to think carefully about whether they want their face controlled by a platform rather than owned by themselves,\" said Dan Neely, CEO of Vermillio, which helps individuals protect their likeness from being misused and also facilitates secure licensing of authorized content. \"Your likeness will be one of the most valuable assets in the AI era, and once you give that control away, you may never get it back.\"Vermillio and Loti are third-party companies working with creators, celebrities and media companies to monitor and enforce likeness rights across the internet. With advancements in AI video generation, their usefulness has ramped up for IP rights holders.Loti CEO Luke Arrigoni said the risks of YouTube's current biometric policy \"are enormous.\"  \"Because the release currently allows someone to be able to attach that name to the actual biometrics of the face, they could create something more synthetic that looks like that person,\" Arrigoni said.Neely and Arrigoni both said they would not currently recommend that any of their clients sign up for likeness detection on YouTube.YouTube's head of creator product, Amjad Hanif, said YouTube built its likeness detection tool to operate \"at the scale of YouTube,\" where hundreds of hours of new footage are posted every minute. The tool is set to be made available to the more than 3 million creators in the YouTube Partner Program by the end of January, Hanif said. \"We do well when creators do well,\" Hanif told CNBC. \"We're here as stewards and supporters of the creator ecosystem, and so we are investing in tools to support them on that journey.\"The rollout comes as AI-generated video tools rapidly improve in quality and accessibility, raising new concerns for creators whose likeness and voice are central to their business.YouTuber Doctor Mike, whose real name is Mikhail Varshavski, makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths that have flooded the internet for nearly a decade.Doctor MikeYouTube creator Mikhail Varshavski, a physician who goes by Doctor Mike on the video platform, said he uses the service's likeness detection tool to review dozens of AI-manipulated videos a week.Varshavski has been on YouTube for nearly a decade and has amassed more than 14 million subscribers on the platform. He makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths. He relies on his credibility as a board-certified physician to inform his viewers.Rapid advances in AI have made it easier for bad actors to copy his face and voice in deepfake videos that could give his viewers misleading medical advice, Varshavski said. He first encountered a deepfake of himself on TikTok, where an AI-generated doppelgänger promoted a \"miracle\" supplement.\"It obviously freaked me out, because I've spent over a decade investing in garnering the audience's trust and telling them the truth and helping them make good health-care decisions,\" he said. \"To see someone use my likeness in order to trick someone into buying something they don't need or that can potentially hurt them, scared everything about me in that situation.\"AI video generation tools like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's Sora have made it significantly easier to create deepfakes of celebrities and creators like Varshavski. That's because their likeness is frequently featured in the datasets used by tech companies to train their AI models. Veo 3 is trained on a subset of the more than 20 billion videos uploaded to YouTube, CNBC reported in July. That could include several hundred hours of video from Varshavski.Deepfakes have \"become more widespread and proliferative,\" Varshavski said. \"I've seen full-on channels created weaponizing these types of AI deep fakes, whether it was for tricking people to buy a product or strictly to bully someone.\"At the moment, creators have no way to monetize unauthorized use of their likeness, unlike the revenue-sharing options available through YouTube's Content ID system for copyrighted material, which is typically used by companies that hold large copyright catalogs. YouTube's Hanif said the company is exploring how a similar model could work for AI-generated likeness use in the future.Earlier this year, YouTube gave creators the option to permit third-party AI companies to train on their videos. Hanif said that millions of creators have opted into that program, with no promise of compensation.Hanif said his team is still working to improve the accuracy of the product but early testing has been successful, though he did not provide accuracy metrics.As for takedown activity across the platform, Hanif said that remains low largely because many creators choose not to delete flagged videos.\"They'll be happy to know that it's there, but not really feel like it merits taking down,\" Hanif said. \"By and far the most common action is to say, 'I've looked at it, but I'm OK with it.'\"Agents and rights advocates told CNBC that low takedown numbers are more likely due to confusion and lack of awareness rather than comfort with AI content.WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

Ether dropped 8.4% to hit $2,776.39.Solana had fallen more than 9%, and was last seen below $125, while other closely watched tokens were also in the red.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBTC.In Asia, a statement by the People's Bank of China on Saturday warning of illegal activities relating to digital currencies heaped pressure on Hong Kong-listed shares of digital assets-related companies, which retreated during Monday's session.The fresh slide in digital assets chimes with a broader risk-off sentiment at the start of a new month. Ben Emons, founder and CIO of Fedwatch Advisors, said that people remain \"nervous\" following the recent bitcoin sell-off, adding that Monday's reversal has broadly been attributed to a $400 million exchange liquidation.Speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday, he highlighted the sizable leverage across bitcoin exchanges, which is up to 200x in some instances. With an estimated $787 billion outstanding leverage in perpetual crypto futures, against some $135 billion outstanding in ETFs, \"you can do the math,\" Emons said. \"There is still a lot of leverage in bitcoin out there. We can expect to some more of these liquidations if bitcoin prices don't get off the lows from here,\" he added.watch nowMonday's dip came on the back of a sharp sell-off in October, which also moved the stock market, Emons said, with bitcoin showing greater correlation with certain indexes including the Nasdaq. \"It's predominantly retail driven, that's the worrying part of it, because retail reacts very differently than institutional [investors],\" he said, noting the decentralized nature of crypto exchanges and opaque nature of the asset class.\"That is something to reckon with going forward from here, as more and more leverage is used in this space.\"Macroeconomic concerns — including uncertainty over a possible U.S. rate cut — continue to weigh on investors' minds, while nagging doubts over overheated valuations in artificial intelligence-related names contributed to November's bumpy markets as crypto volatility heightened.And in crypto markets, several data points suggest more short-term weakness for digital assets is ahead. Perpetual futures open interest has fallen, a sign of reduced speculative positioning and leverage in the market, according to Zach Pandl, head of research at crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale. He also pointed to relatively weak trading volumes on centralized and decentralized exchange, which could suggest \"subdued trading activity and risk appetite.\"watch now",

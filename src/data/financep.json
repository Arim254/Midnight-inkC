    "body": "Billionaire serial entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban has some job-hunting advice for his two children — and anyone else who finds themselves looking for entry-level roles — in the age of artificial intelligence.The advice is simple: Prioritize working for a smaller company over fighting for a job at a large corporation.At a big business, your AI skills are probably somewhat extraneous, says Cuban: You might know how to use AI effectively, but so does everyone in the company's large, established IT department.\"Small- to medium-size companies don't have that depth,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It. \"They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don't have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results.\"Cuban referenced his own company Cost Plus Drugs as an example, in a podcast episode of \"The Dumbest Guy In the Room\" that published on Sept. 30. \"People that understand AI and agentics, [who] can go and look at our processes and automate them using AI ... [can] help us become more productive, competitive and profitable,\" he said.Podcast host John Dick's company CivicScience was similarly situated, Cuban noted.\"[Small companies] have to compete differently, and they don't have the resources to just have a huge IT department,\" said Cuban. \"Just like we saw with the early days of the internet, you hired young kids who were more comfortable with it, who learned it already and could come in and implement new things.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterNinety-five percent of companies haven't yet seen measurable revenue return from their AI investments, according to a July report from Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. The few companies in the minority are largely early-stage tech startups run by young entrepreneurs, who build their companies' processes around AI models specifically tailored to their businesses, the MIT report said.\"I tell [my children], like I tell every young kid, there's going to be two types of companies in this in this country: There's going to be those who are great at AI and those who used to be in business ... And if you're looking for a job, it's going to be easier to work for a small company than a large company,\" Cuban said on the podcast.Cuban, 67, has three children, including two daughters currently attending college at Vanderbilt University and UCLA. He's advised them to \"learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,\" he told the \"TBPN\" podcast in an Aug. 20 episode. \"Companies don't understand how to implement all that right now to get a competitive advantage,\" he added.Some other experts also say young people seeking entry-level jobs in the age of AI should emphasize their soft skills — like communication, emotional intelligence and critical thinking — to potential employers. Being curious, adaptable and embracing new opportunities to learn \"is a skill in and of itself,\" Kiersten Barnet, executive director of the nonprofit New York Jobs CEO Council, said at the CNBC Workforce Executive Council Summit on Oct. 7.Ben Goodwin, the CEO and co-founder of beverage company Olipop, attributes most of his success with his $1.85 billion-dollar company to his human skills, not his technical capabilities, he told CNBC Make It in September.\"Things that have been really important for me have been believing in myself, emotional regulation, things like storytelling, [and] getting as good as possible at leading people as quickly as possible,\" he said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

He did not directly confirm that Core Scientific is the third-party provider.CoreWeave tried to acquire Core Scientific for $9 billion earlier this year. Core Scientific shareholders voted against the proposed deal. Core Scientific shares closed down 10% Tuesday.During CoreWeave's quarterly earnings call on Monday, JPMorgan Securities analyst Mark Murphy asked if the delay was related to Core Scientific, but Intrator declined to name the company.

    "body": "Lisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAMD CEO Lisa Su said on Tuesday that the company's overall revenue growth would expand to about 35% per year over the next three to five years, driven by \"insatiable\" demand for artificial intelligence chips.Su said that much of that would be captured by the company's AI data center business, which it expects to grow at about 80% per year over the same time period, on track to hit tens of billions of dollars of sales by 2027.\"This is what we see as our potential given the customer traction, both with the announced customers, as well as customers that are currently working very closely with us,\" Su told analysts.Ultimately, Su said that AMD could be able to achieve \"double-digit\" share in the data center AI chip market over the next three to five years.AMD shares fell 3% in extended trading. Shares rose in extended trading when AMD said its gross margins in coming years would be between a range of 55% to 58%, better than analysts had expected. The AI chip market is currently dominated by Nvidia, which has over 90% of the market share, according to some estimates, and which has given the company a market cap of over $4.6 trillion, versus AMD's roughly $387 billion valuation.AMD is holding its first financial analyst day since 2022, as the company has found itself at the center of a boom in data center spending for AI.While companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars in total on graphics processing unit (GPU) chips to build and power artificial intelligence applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, they are also looking for alternatives to increase capacity and control costs. AMD is the only other major developer of GPUs aside from Nvidia.In October, AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI in which it would sell the AI startup billions of dollars in its Instinct AI chips over multiple years, starting with enough chips in 2026 to use 1 gigawatt of power.As part of the deal, OpenAI could end up taking a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Su also highlighted long-term deals with Oracle and Meta on Tuesday.AMD shares have nearly doubled so far in 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

AMD reported $5 billion in AI chip sales in its fiscal 2024.That's up from the company's previous forecast of a $500 billion market in 2028 for AI chips. But the updated AMD figure also includes central processors (CPU), an important kind of chip that sits at the heart of a computer, but isn't a pure AI accelerator like the GPUs made by Nvidia and AMD.AMD's Epyc CPUs are still the company's most important product by sales. It primarily competes with Intel and some smaller Arm-based processors in the CPU market. AMD also makes chips for game consoles, networking parts, and other devices.On Tuesday, although AMD focused much of its focus on its growing AI business, it told shareholders that its older businesses were growing too.\"The other message that we want to leave you with today is every other part of our business is firing on all cylinders, and that's actually a very nice place to be,\" Su said.watch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a bilateral lunch with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban (not pictured) at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 7, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has doled out dozens of executive clemency grants in the past few weeks alone, issuing pardons and commutations to major business figures, political supporters and other allies.Some hope he's just getting started.Trump started wielding his presidential mercy powers aggressively on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned roughly 1,500 people who were charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Presidential pardons erase federal criminal convictions, while commutations shorten or cancel prison sentences, and sometimes related fines.In subsequent months, clemency recipients have included a slew of well-known names, including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, ex-Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, Nikola founder Trevor Milton, reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.On Monday, Trump granted largely symbolic pardons to more than six dozen people who were involved in efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin revealed on social media. The people included in the batch of pardons are not facing federal charges related to the 2020 election. The presidential pardon power does not extend to state-level prosecutions.That group includes Rudy Giuliani, Trump's onetime personal lawyer and former New York City mayor, as well as his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.Some recipients of Trump's clemency, including multiple people involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, have since been charged with new crimes.The Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney has a formal process for people to apply for clemency, and the agency has established standards for considering petitions. But Trump's White House has reportedly taken over much of the process, including by appointing a former clemency recipient, Alice Johnson, as the administration's \"pardon czar.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsPrior presidents have been accused of misusing their clemency powers, including Biden, whose last-minute pardons for his family members and preemptive pardons for others generated bipartisan condemnations.But Trump's approach, which has at times favored famous figures and those who have heaped praise upon him, has spurred unique criticism.\"It's like a celebrity pardon-a-thon,\" John Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration official, told The Washington Post in June.It has also given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers and lobbyists who are charging steep fees to help their clients seek Trump's clemency, the online publication NOTUS reported.Trump pulled back on the pardons over the summer, after White House officials grew concerned about the efforts to profit off the process, NBC News reported last month. But the raft of clemency actions in recent weeks suggests that Trump does not currently share those concerns.That could be good news for a number of high-profile figures who have been eyed as possible candidates for pardons or commutations from Trump.Based on public reports and the president's own remarks, here's who that list might include:Ghislaine MaxwellGhislaine Maxwell on September 20, 2013 in New York City.Laura Cavanaugh | Getty ImagesThe House Judiciary Committee's Democratic minority on Monday shared \"whistleblower information\" that Maxwell, the longtime accomplice of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is preparing a \"commutation application\" for the Trump administration.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for acting as a procurer of teenage girls for Epstein. The Supreme Court in early October declined to take up Maxwell's appeal of her conviction.She \"has good reason to believe\" that she \"may receive the extraordinary grant of clemency from you,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the committee's ranking member, accused Trump in a letter seeking answers from him.\"Feigning ignorance and distancing yourself from the situation, you have pointedly refused to rule out clemency for her,\" Raskin wrote to Trump.Trump has given ambiguous answers when asked on multiple occasions about that possibility of pardoning Maxwell.Asked on Oct. 6 if he was considering a pardon for her, Trump said, \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.\"\"I will speak to the DOJ,\" Trump said when asked to clarify if he was considering it. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it.\"A White House spokeswoman, in response to the whistleblower claims shared Monday, told NBC that it \"does not comment on potential clemency requests.\"\"As President Trump has stated, pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something he has thought about,\" the spokeswoman said.Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, said in a statement Tuesday that Maxwell's sentence \"should be upheld like anyone else's.\"\"To now entertain a commutation would sadly send a clear message to survivors of her crimes — and to countless others who have been victimized sexually — that her power outweighs truth and that the justice owed to survivors can be denied,\" Hersh said.DiddySean \"Diddy\" Combs sits with his lawyers Brian Steel, and Alexandra Shapiro during a court sentencing, after the music mogul was convicted on charges of transporting prostitutes to engage in drug-fueled sexual performances, in New York City, U.S., Oct. 3, 2025 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | ReutersMusic mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' path to clemency currently appears narrow at best.Combs was sentenced to more than four years behind bars in early October over his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.After his conviction, Combs' lawyers reached out to Trump to seek a pardon, a member of his legal team told CNN.\"It's my understanding that we've reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,\" attorney Nicole Westmoreland told the news outlet.Trump said in an Aug. 1 interview with Newsmax that he was leaning against pardoning Combs.On Oct. 6, Trump confirmed that Combs' team had reached out.\"A lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him 'Puff Daddy,' [he] has asked me for a pardon,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.After TMZ reported on Oct. 20 that Trump was considering commuting Combs' sentence, the White House pushed back, calling the story false.Elizabeth HolmesFormer Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes alongside her boyfriend Billy Evans, walks back to her hotel following a hearing at the Robert E. Peckham U.S. Courthouse on March 17, 2023 in San Jose, California.Philip Pacheco | Getty ImagesElizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, in late 2022 was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for deceiving investors about her now-shuttered company's blood-testing technology.Trump has not commented on Holmes, and she has not explicitly pleaded for clemency, though she has maintained she was \"wrongly convicted of defrauding investors.\"Holmes is nevertheless included in the online betting site Polymarket's list of possible Trump pardon subjects, with her chances currently on par with Maxwell's.On Tuesday, Politico reported that some people who identify with the pro-Trump \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement have thrown their support behind Holmes.In late August, Holmes resumed posting on her dormant social media account on X. Some of her posts appear to approvingly reference Trump and officials in his administration, while others detail her allegedly harsh prison conditions.On Oct. 31 she reached out to Santos, whose sentence Trump had recently commuted, writing, \"Glad you are working to fix the many problems you have experienced personally.\"On Nov.3, she responded to a post calling Trump the \"Best President Ever\" in response to the president reportedly stepping in to help provide medical treatment to Scott Adams, one of his supporters.Sam Bankman-FriedFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the U.S. courthouse in New York City on July 26, 2023.Amr Alfiky | ReutersSBF is serving a 25-year prison sentence following his conviction in late 2023 for defrauding customers of his cryptocurrency exchange FTX.The 33-year-old and his parents have reportedly pursued a pardon, in part by consulting a lawyer with ties to Trump, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both reported in March. Bankman-Fried has also expressed more conservative political views in media interviews conducted after Trump returned to the White House.Trump has embraced the crypto industry in his second term, but there is no indication that he is considering a pardon for Bankman-Fried.After Trump pardoned Zhao, the founder of crypto exchange Binance, on Oct. 23, SBF's chances of getting a pardon spiked on Polymarket.Asked in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview why he pardoned Zhao, Trump said: \"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is.\"Bob MenendezFormer Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) departs Manhattan Federal Court after his sentencing on Jan. 29, 2025 in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesAllies of Menendez, the former Democratic U.S. senator from New Jersey, have made multiple attempts to ask Trump for a pardon or commutation of his 11-year prison sentence, NBC reported in May.While Trump has not ruled out clemency for Menendez, some of the former senator's allies believe the president will ultimately decline to do so, NBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Menendez, 71, was convicted in July 2024 of bribery and other charges. He reported to prison in June.— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Tuesday extended until late Thursday night a pause in a federal judge's order that the Trump administration pay full SNAP benefits for November.The two-day delay, which was objected to by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, gives Congress time to pass a short-term funding bill that would reopen the U.S. government, which has been shut down since Oct. 1, and fund the SNAP program that provides 42 million Americans with food stamps.The Trump administration had argued in a filing Monday with the Supreme Court that the tangled legal dispute over the benefits could soon be rendered moot by Congress passing that bill this week.If the bill is approved, and SNAP benefits start flowing as normal, that would remove the justification for lawsuits demanding that they continue during the shutdown.The House of Representatives is expected to start voting on the Senate-approved bill on Wednesday afternoon, and President Donald Trump has indicated he would sign that bill.U.S. District Court for Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell last Thursday ordered the administration to pay the full SNAP benefits, rejecting the administration's plan to pay just 65% of that aid. The administration originally planned to not pay any benefits during November despite $4.6 billion being available for that purpose from a contingency fund.McConnell directed federal officials to use not only the contingency fund, but also to use funds from the Children's Nutrition Program to help pay for the full benefits, which the administration had refused to do.A federal appeals court in Boston upheld McConnell's order, but a short-term stay imposed by Justice Jackson blocked the order. That stay was due to expire on Tuesday night.In its order on Tuesday extending the stay by two days, the Supreme Court said that the administration's application for a longer-term stay of the order pending an appeal had been referred to the full court for consideration.The court said that the stay will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday.Tuesday's order by the court noted that Jackson had said that she would \"deny the request for extension of the administrative stay and would deny the application.\" There was no written dissent by Jackson explaining her objection.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state had sued the administration in another case to compel full SNAP benefits payments during the shutdown, in a statement said, \"This decision means millions of Americans will once again be left wondering how they will feed their families.\"\"We hope to see an end to this suffering soon, as the government reopens and SNAP is once again fully funded. In the meantime, any New Yorkers who have received their November SNAP benefits should not be afraid to use them.\"",

Jean Carroll $5 million in damages after holding him liable for sexually abusing her during an encounter in a New York department store in the 1990s and for defaming her decades later.Trump's request on Monday comes nearly 11 months after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the verdict issued by a civil jury in Manhattan federal court in May 2023.The petition to the Supreme Court says that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the trial, made a \"series of indefensible evidentiary rulings,\" among them \"improperly admitting highly inflammatory propensity evidence against President Trump.\"That evidence included testimony by two other women who alleged that Trump committed sexual misconduct against them at other times.The petition also says that Kaplan erred by allowing Carroll's lawyer to play for jurors the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their prior consent.There is no automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not known when the high court will decide whether to take Trump's appeal.Writer Jean Carroll and Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump look on as Lawyer John Sauer (not pictured) argues for him, as he is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a $5 million jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming writer E.

Jurors in that case did not find Trump liable for rape, but did find him liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her.It is that verdict that Trump has asked the Supreme Court to overturn with the new petition.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks, during the swearing-in ceremony for Sergio Gor as U.S. Ambassador to India, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 10, 2025.

Brian Snyder | ReutersFlight disruptions that have marred air travel for millions of people in recent weeks could continue even after the government shutdown ends, airlines and the secretary of Transportation said.The Senate on Monday night passed a bill that could end the longest federal government shutdown in history, sending it to the House for a vote.But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday that won't be an immediate fix.\"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel but it depends on controllers coming back to work,\" Duffy said at a press conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.Duffy also warned severe disruptions over the past few days could get much worse without a deal.The Senate vote came as staffing shortages of air traffic controllers, who are required to work without their regular paychecks in the shutdown, have delayed or canceled thousands of flights, with issues worsening in recent days. Controllers missed their second full paychecks of the shutdown this week, and some have taken up second jobs and are working with increasing levels of stress, government and union officials have said.Even if the House passes the bill that will fund the federal government through January, airlines said they will need time to readjust.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivals\"Airlines' reduced flight schedules cannot immediately bounce back to full capacity right after the government reopens,\" Airlines for America, a lobbying group for airlines including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, said late Monday. \"It will take time, and there will be residual effects for days. With the Thanksgiving travel period beginning next week and the busy shipping season around the corner, the time to act is now to help mitigate any further impacts to Americans.\"Airlines will need time to reconfigure schedules and position planes and crews, something they were forced to quickly address with last week's required flight cuts.More than 5 million travelers have been affected by airline staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, Airlines for America said . The disruptions have sent some passengers looking for alternatives, from buses to rental cars and even private jets.Last Friday, the Trump administration started requiring commercial airlines to cut 4% of their domestic flights at 40 busy U.S. airports, with larger reductions on the way if the shutdown doesn't end, as officials blamed the strain on air traffic controllers.watch nowAviation groups have said that record numbers of travelers are expected for the Thanksgiving period, with the holiday just over two weeks away.Just over 5% of the scheduled 22,811 U.S. departures were canceled on Tuesday, a relatively light day for travel generally, according to aviation data firm Cirium. That's down from an 8.7% cancellation rate on Monday, or 2,239 flights, and 2,633 cancellations on Sunday, or 10.2% of the schedule. Delays had also piled up with staffing shortages and bad weather at major hubs, including Chicago O'Hare.The shutdown, like the one in late 2018 to early 2019, has thrust aviation's strains into the spotlight. The previous shutdown, however, ended hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers snarled air traffic in the New York area.Aviation groups on Tuesday urged lawmakers to not only end the shutdown but to provide more Department of Transportation funding to help modernize air traffic control and hire more controllers, who were in short supply even before the shutdown began.\"The government shutdown has disrupted that work and slowed the strong momentum we have built for modernization,\" the Modern Skies Coalition, which includes major airline, airport and aerospace groups such as Boeing, GE Aerospace and others, as well as labor unions, wrote in an open letter to Congress.President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to dock pay of air traffic controllers who are absent. \"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who weren't absent during the shutdown.Duffy said he supported Trump's idea and that he was concerned about the dedication and \"patriotism\" of controllers who haven't shown up for work. \"If we have controllers who systemically weren't doing their job, we will take action,\" he said.Duffy said controllers would receive about 70% of their pay within two days of the shutdown ending.A day earlier, Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole in the shutdown that ended in 2019.Duffy said the shutdown has made air traffic controller staffing more challenging, with 15 to 20 of them retiring a day instead of around four retiring a day before the government closure. He said the country is roughly 2,000 controllers short of what the system needs.\"The job of keeping aviation safe and secure is tough every day, but forcing federal employees to do it without pay is unacceptable,\" the Modern Skies Coalition wrote in its open letter. \"We owe public servants at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other agencies supporting aviation, like the National Transportation Safety Board, the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection, a debt of gratitude and a swift ending to this shutdown.\"",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said Monday on CNN.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesUntil Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Jacob Cooper's Saturdays don't look like a typical 29-year-old's.On a recent one, Cooper was up by 4:15 a.m., out of his Brooklyn apartment by 4:30, and ready to cook at a nearby commercial kitchen by 5. He and his staff prepared hundreds of hand-rolled, bite-sized bagels they'd sell that day across two events in New York City.Cooper spent his morning selling freshly baked pizza bagels to pop-up shoppers in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, worked at the Queens Night Market until midnight, and finally ended his day at home at 2 a.m.Despite the 22-hour day, Cooper says he doesn't regret leaving his former six-figure tech job to start his food business, Pizzabagel.nyc.Cooper launched the business in January 2025 and as of October has brought in close to $92,000 for the year.Jacob Cooper launched a pizza bagel business in 2025 after leaving his previous career in tech.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItHe logs up to 90 hours per week on the job but says it's a 180 from the burnout he felt before.\"Even though I'm working as hard as I ever have, every customer that comes up to the stand and tells me how great they are, every time they come back wanting more, it helps keep me going,\" Cooper says. \"I have a lot of fun doing this.\"From burnout to bagelsCooper didn't plan to become a pizza bagels pro. His first career was in tech.He studied computer science at Cornell and in 2017 co-founded an AI company with classmates, becoming the startup's chief technology officer. Over the next seven years, the team raised money, hired staff and weathered the Covid-19 pandemic.Jacob Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItBut by 2023, Cooper was burning out. He and the CEO fought a lot, \"and we both kind of said, 'this is not really working,'\" he says. In 2024, Cooper left the company and his $120,000 annual salary without a plan.After a few months of feeling lost, inspiration struck: Cooper loved Bagel Bites when he was a kid, but as an adult revisited them and felt they could use an upgrade.Cooper experimented with pizza bagel recipes with the help of Reddit forums, cookbooks and \"a million\" online videos. He started cooking in his apartment and even bought extra refrigerators so he and his roommate had enough space. Cooper estimates he made some 40,000 bagels before his recipe became consistent.Pizzabagel.nyc currently offers six options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItCooper had sold a portion of his equity back to the AI company for $250,000, pocketing about half of that after taxes to pay his rent, insurance and other basic expenses. He also funneled that money into Pizzabagel.nyc. \"That is what allowed me to take a few months off, start this business, buy the equipment, buy the minivan, test things out, [and] lose money on it,\" Cooper says.How the business makes moneyRight now, Pizzabagel.nyc makes money in three ways: pop-ups, catering and farmers markets.It offers six pizza bagel options, including cheese, pepperoni, spicy vodka, buffalo dip, ricotta and French onion. Bagel costs vary, but at the Queens Night Market are sold two for $5.In February, its first month in business, the company made around $3,000 in sales. Cooper bought a car in May and scaled his events way up. The business started to break even over the summer and jumped to roughly $10,000 in sales for July. By September, the business hit a milestone of bringing in $20,000.It was enough to cover the business's expenses for the month. Cooper's operating costs fluctuate, but for September totaled $15,000 including payroll for one full-time employee and a small crew of part-timers, his kitchen rental, food costs, event fees and other costs.Cooper reinvested the $5,000 profit back into the company.Christina Locopo | CNBC Make ItCooper currently doesn't take a salary and plans to pour any profits back into the company. He estimates he has three years' worth of basic living expenses saved to keep this up. He's also invested $50,000 of his own money into the business.\"At the end of the day, I know that if this business doesn't work out, I can go get another tech job or I can do something else,\" Cooper says. \"I'm probably not going to end up on my parents' couch. Probably.\"Learning from old regretsPrior to opening his food business, Cooper says he'd never set foot in a commercial kitchen, cooked professionally or worked a restaurant service job. He worried about his lack of experience in the field.Cooper took the mistakes he learned as a tech leader to set himself up better in the food world.\"My biggest regret is that I was just young and inexperienced and didn't know what I was doing,\" Cooper says about his CTO days. \"I was too stubborn to look for help a lot of the time. Now I know to look for help. I know that I'm a newcomer to the food industry.\"Another big challenge is out of his control: the weather.For example, on a recent rainy Saturday, the business sold $1,000 worth of food at the Queens Night Market compared to the $2,000 it moves on a good day.\"You're basically just praying it's nice weather so people come out and buy stuff,\" Cooper says.Eyes on the freezer aisleCooper says he originally gave himself six months to see if Pizzabagel.nyc had momentum; by the summer, he decided to keep at it and additionally launched Littlebagel.nyc, a sister pop-up operation that specializes in mini-bagels with fun offerings like chili crisp spreads; tomato and ricotta sandwiches; and the classic bacon, egg and cheese.Jacob Cooper launched Littlebagel.nyc in September, a sister pop-up that sells mini bagels with fun spreads and sandwich options.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make ItEvents will slow in the winter, but Cooper knows his next move: In year two of the business, he wants to get his pizza bagels into the freezer aisle of grocery stores, specifically by his 30th birthday in January. He believes cracking the consumer packaged goods space will mean long-term success for the business.Making and selling pizza bagels might not be his forever career, Cooper says, but he's excited to see where it goes.\"I'm not going to force this business to work for me,\" he says. \"I look at it really practically, and if I'm having fun and I think there's a lot of growth, and people are really enjoying the product, I'm going to keep doing it.\"Jacob Cooper's goal with Pizzabagel.nyc is to get them into the freezer aisle at grocery stores.Kaan Oguz | CNBC Make It",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building after the U.S. Senate advances a bill to end the government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S.,  November 10, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEconomic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business.The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law.From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics.\"The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. \"While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases.\"Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week.watch nowThe BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. \"But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,\" they said.That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by \"at least a week,\" Goldman said.For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading.When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters.Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture.\"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. \"Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown.Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case.As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesRocket Lab posted record revenues in the third quarter as it scoops up more launch deals and builds its backlog.The space stock slipped more than 1% on Tuesday, pulling back from earlier gains.The company, which makes satellites and rockets and provides launch services to its customers, on Monday reported revenue of $155 million for the period. That surpassed the $152 million forecast from analysts polled by LSEG, and it was up 48% from about $105 million a year ago. Rocket Lab also posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 3 cents per share, versus the 10-cent per share loss anticipated.Additionally, Rocket Lab issued strong guidance for the current quarter, saying it expects revenues between $170 million and $180 million. Analysts had forecast $172 million in revenues.Rocket Lab said it's experiencing a record backlog, with 49 rocket launches on contract. The company said it signed 17 of those deals during the third quarter and plans to close out the year with over 20 launches.In an earnings release, CEO Peter Beck said the Long Beach, California, company is \"just days away\" from reaching a new annual launch record. Rocket Lab is also tackling mergers and acquisitions that target key defense initiatives such as President Donald Trump's missile defense system plan known as the 'Golden Dome,\" Beck added.Competition is intensifying in the space technology sector as the U.S. government and NASA lean on more independent contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, to power missions to return to the moon. Growing excitement has also brought a wave of space companies to the public markets this year, including Texas-based Firefly Aerospace.Last month, Rocket Lab's stock jumped more than 31% after announcing a slew of new launch deals. Shares have more than doubled this year and surged nearly 270% over the last twelve months. The stock has pulled back about 13% in November amid a broader market selloff.During the third quarter, the company closed its acquisition of satellite sensor maker Geost and opened a new launch site for its Neutron rocket.Rocket Lab reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $26.3 million, topping the $21 million to $23 million loss range previously forecast. Analysts anticipated a $22.2 million adjusted EBITDA loss, according to FactSet.The company expects adjusted EBITDA losses to range between $23 million and $29 million in the fourth quarter, surpassing the $13 million loss forecast by FactSet.WATCH: Rocket Lab CEO talks competing for Space Force contractswatch now",

    "body": "Duolingo, Doordash and Roblox appsTiffany Heard-Grear | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAcross the tech sector this earnings season, companies told Wall Street to get ready for ramped up spending as the artificial intelligence boom accelerates.But while investors largely rewarded the megacaps for their boosted capital expenditure forecasts, or just shrugged off their guidance, companies outside the trillion-dollar club are getting punished.DoorDash, Duolingo and Roblox all saw their stock prices suffer double-digit slumps after the companies said spending is on the incline, raising concerns about future profitability. Unlike the tech giants, which are promising hefty buildouts to meet soaring demand for AI services and workloads, smaller companies are getting viewed more skeptically, with analysts uncertain about whether their bets will pay off and result in substantial new revenue opportunities.\"Investors don't like investment cycles,\" Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney told CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" last week. That's what happened, he said, with \"all those companies that went into and out of this earnings cycle and negatively surprised the market by saying, 'We really want to lean into investments first.'\"watch nowDoorDash's stock sank 17% on Thursday, its worst drop in the food delivery platform's five years as a public company. In its third-quarter earnings report, DoorDash said it plans to shell out \"several hundred million dollars\" on new products and technology next year.\"We wish there was a way to grow a baby into an adult without investment, or to see the baby grow into an adult overnight, but we do not believe this is how life or business works,\" the company wrote in its earnings release.DoorDash has recently amped up investments in autonomous delivery, with the launch of Dot in September, and spent a combined $5.1 billion on restaurant booking platform SevenRooms and British food delivery service Deliveroo.CEO Tony Xu said on the earnings call that the company's investment track record signals \"some success in repeating this playbook, and we're doing this now for future growth.\"Analysts see it differently.\"Looking ahead, we maintain our Hold rating as we see limited multiple expansion opportunity until there is greater clarity surrounding how long investments could weigh on margins,\" wrote analysts at Gordon Haskett.A DoorDash spokesperson said in a statement that the company is \"fortunate to have an increasingly successful core business\" and that it takes a \"disciplined investment approach\" to new projects.'Monetization and user growth at odds'Duolingo also had its worst day as a public company on Thursday, despite beating on revenue and bookings in its third-quarter earnings report.The stock lost a quarter of its value and is now down 41% for the year, after Duolingo said it's prioritizing finding new users. The company has been pouring money into AI features, such as an interactive video call option, as it tries to win over paying subscribers.\"There are experiments that put monetization and user growth at odds, and part of my job has been, always, arbitrating between these two,\" CEO Luis von Ahn told CNBC after the earnings report. He said the company is shifting the \"trade off to be much more towards user growth.\"On the earnings call, von Ahn said that it's \"going to take some time for us to see the results, financial results, over the long-term investments that we're doing.\"After the report, analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets downgraded the stock to the equivalent of hold from buy, citing concerns that increased investments will weigh on near-term bookings, earnings and valuation.\"This suggests to us that it might take several quarters to see more meaningful financial benefits,\" the firm said.Duolingo didn't provide a comment.watch nowMeanwhile, the biggest companies in the tech industry may similarly be years away from seeing if their big AI wagers result in profits. But investors aren't terribly concerned.Alphabet and Amazon both rallied after reporting earnings in late October. The companies again raised their forecasts for capital expenditures for the year and suggested that there's no slowdown coming in 2026.Amazon Web Services is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure, a market where Google is third, and is racing to build out data centers to meet expected demand for compute capacity tied to AI. AWS and Google are also investing in their own silicon so that they're less dependent on Nvidia and can offer customers a more complete tech stack.Microsoft, which is second in the cloud infrastructure market, slipped after its earnings report, which also included a guide to higher capex. But the company, valued at close to $4 trillion, still mostly has the backing of Wall Street as it competes for more AI deals and bigger workloads.The exception among the megacaps is Meta, which sank 11% following earnings. The company expects to spend as much as $72 billion this year on capex, but doesn't sell a cloud service that rivals Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wears the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, as he delivers a speech presenting the new line of smart glasses, during the Meta Connect event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., Sept. 17, 2025. Carlos Barria | ReutersWhile Meta says it's infusing AI across its product portfolio and improving targeting in its core ad business, the lack of clarity surrounding revenue is giving investors pause. Mahaney grouped Meta in with companies that he said \"negatively surprised\" the market.Roblox was also in that category.Shares of the online gaming platform fell almost 16% on Oct. 30, after the company warned that higher spending on safety and infrastructure could hit margins. CEO David Baszucki told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that safety on its platform was a \"top priority.\"Finance chief Naveen Chopra said the investments may weigh on near-term engagement and bookings but are \"a magnifier of longer-term growth.\"Analysts at Benchmark downgraded shares to hold from buy, expecting investments will hinder profitability. Roth analysts, who recommend holding the stock, also see a potential hit to margins next year.\"The impact from these initiatives may negatively impact platform engagement in the near term,\" the analysts at Roth wrote, \"but is expected to have a greater long-term benefit for users.\"Roblox didn't provide a comment for this story.WATCH: Rising tide lifting hyperscaler boatswatch now",

    "body": "Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks at a press conference with other Senate Democrats who voted to restore government funding, in Washington, DC on November 9, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUpdate: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.Senate Democrats are poised to help Republicans pass a bill that could lead to the end of the government shutdown. But the deal they're agreeing to doesn't directly address what was once Democrats' key demand: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to expire by year's end.The Senate took a major step toward ending the shutdown on Sunday night, when eight Democrats in the narrowly divided chamber voted for a procedural motion that paves the way for approval of a negotiated funding bill.Those eight Democrats, who broke with party leadership, were just enough for the measure to hit the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. That rule has prevented Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, from reopening the government on their own.The procedural vote's passage broke a nearly six-week logjam in which most Senate Democrats repeatedly shot down a Republican-backed bill that would temporarily resume government funding at current levels.What Democrats wantedDemocrats had demanded that any funding bill must include significant additional spending on health care protections and other key measures.Most notably, they fought for a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits under the ACA, which were introduced during the Biden administration and are set to expire by year's end. If those subsidies lapse, millions of Americans could either lose their health insurance or see their premiums rise significantly.Democrats also sought to reverse some recent cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. And they aimed to address the Trump administration's freezing of congressionally approved federal funds, which Democrats say is illegal.Update: The Senate on Monday night passed the deal, sending the funding bill to the House.What's in the funding dealThe text of the funding deal that helped spur Sunday's breakthrough leaves many of those priorities unaddressed. The 31-page bill makes no mention of the expiring Obamacare tax credits.U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) looks on outside the Senate Chamber after the vote on the 40th day of the partial government shutdown, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 9, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersInstead, the agreement includes a guarantee from Republican leadership that the Senate will vote on a health care bill drafted by Democrats before the second week of December.\"That is a big step, because otherwise there's no way for the minority to get a bill onto the floor of the U.S. Senate,\" Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Sunday night after helping to broker the deal.Even if a bill to extend the tax credits passes the Senate, it would have to be taken up and passed through the GOP-led House, and then signed by President Donald Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not promised to bring such a bill to a vote in his chamber.The deal currently moving through the Senate also reportedly does not challenge Trump's ability to make rescissions of congressionally appropriated funds.But it does include a \"minibus\" that funds three of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and it would resume funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 30.That full-year funding would cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, sources familiar with the deal told NBC News. The Trump administration has said that full SNAP benefits cannot be paid during the shutdown, prompting ongoing lawsuits from Democratic state leaders.The deal would also reverse the Trump administration's shutdown-related \"reductions in force\" or layoffs of federal workers, and ensure backpay for the paychecks they missed during the shutdown.Deal divides DemocratsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" he said Sunday.U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a press conference to discuss how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting healthcare, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 29, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDistrustful Democrats had previously rejected Republicans' insistence that any negotiations on the Obamacare subsidies could only come once the government was reopened.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also panned the Senate deal, and vowed to fight it if it comes to his chamber.But King, who negotiated the Sunday compromise along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, maintained that it was futile to keep the painful shutdown going in hopes of getting Republicans to bend on health care.\"The question was, 'Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?' Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen,\" he told the press Sunday night.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe major shift came just days after Democratic candidates trounced Republicans up and down the ballot in the first elections since Trump returned to the White House.Additionally, numerous polls have show more Americans pinning their blame for the shutdown on Trump and Republicans, rather than Democrats. Surveys have also shown most Americans supported Democrats' initial main demand of extending the health care subsidies.But the stalemate dragged on, taking an increasingly severe toll on major industries and key federal services as many government workers remain furloughed or required to work without pay.Thinned-out staffing among air traffic controllers has caused mounting flight delays and cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country.The political fallout from the Senate Democrats' shutdown shift remains to be seen. Critics were quick to accuse the Democratic defectors of folding despite holding an arguably strong position on the shutdown. But defenders of the move say it could benefit Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections.\"With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table — or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way,\" Shaheen said in a statement.\"If they don't fix this, here's my prediction. They're going to look at last Tuesday's election as a good night compared to what they're going to see next year,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Monday morning.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

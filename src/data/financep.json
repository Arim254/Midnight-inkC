    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyDisney and James Cameron's third Avatar movie, \"Avatar: Fire and Ash,\" hit theaters Thursday, snapping up $12 million in early preview screenings domestically.The second installment in the film series, \"The Way of Water,\" had a better start and tallied $5 million more in its Thursday preview haul in 2022. Still, box office analysts expect \"Fire and Ash\" will bring in at least $100 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada.\"A lot is riding on the performance of 'Avatar: Fire and Ash,' and with less than two weeks remaining in the year, the film's results will play a pivotal role in shaping the annual box office totals,\" Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC.Fueling global ticket sales will be international markets, which collected $43.1 million in preview screenings. \"The circumstances surrounding each 'Avatar' film have been quite different,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"The first was a sleeper-turned-phenomenon during a pre-streaming box office heyday, the second a beneficiary of pent-up sequel demand and eventized-status in moviegoing's post-Covid recovery and the third is now opening in a more competitive and new-normal market.\"The Avatar franchise is a unicorn in Hollywood. Despite garnering widespread acclaim and massive financial success at the box office, the franchise has never quite captured the cultural relevance that \"Star Wars\" or the Marvel Cinematic Universe — both also owned by Disney — have enjoyed. Toy sales fizzled and cosplayers donning heavy blue makeup at pop culture fan conventions have become few and far between.Yet, both 2009's \"Avatar\" and 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" have topped $2 billion at the global box office, with the first film teetering close to $3 billion in total ticket receipts. \"The constant is the James Cameron factor,\" Robbins said. \"Audiences expect grand visuals, sound and storytelling when they buy tickets to his movies. They consistently meet or exceed expectations with long runways at the box office and exclusive theatrical windows because they deliver an experience that cannot be duplicated at home.\"Driving these strong hauls is the sale of premium large format tickets for screens like IMAX and Dolby, as well as 3D showings, which tend to be more expensive than regular tickets. While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside of the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.Dergarabedian said the franchise has consistently benefited from moviegoers' enthusiasm for seeing the films in 3D. \"The original 'Avatar,' released in 2009, was a groundbreaking film that reignited widespread interest in 3D cinema, setting the stage for subsequent entries to capitalize on this trend,\" he said.The international preview sales shared by Disney on Friday did not include China. The company noted that early estimates indicate an opening day of around $17.1 million, which would mark the third-highest opening day for a Motion Picture Association film since \"The Way of Water.\" \"While 'Fire and Ash' is looking at a diminished box office opening relative to 'The Way of Water,' it's all about the long game,\" Robbins said. \"Premium screens are locked up into the new year, Cameron's films are not front-loaded like most Hollywood franchises, and international performance will again far outweigh domestic.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump delivered remarks on lowering prescription drug prices during the event. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesSeveral of the largest U.S. and European-based drugmakers inked deals with President Donald Trump on Friday to voluntarily sell their medications for less, as his administration pushes to link the nation's drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.That includes Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, GSK, Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim and Novartis. In exchange, the companies agreed to a three-year grace period during which their products won't face Trump's planned pharmaceutical-specific tariffs — as long as the drugmakers further invest in U.S. manufacturing. Among the most notable pledges on Friday is that Bristol Myers Squibb will offer Eliquis, its blockbuster blood thinner and top-prescribed product, for free to Medicaid.The companies make up the majority of the 17 drugmakers Trump sent letters to in July, calling on them to lower prices as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive that policy, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"\"As of today, 14 out of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies ... have now agreed to drastically lower drug prices for … the American people and the American patients,\" Trump said at an event on Friday. \"This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care, by far, and every single American will benefit.\"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Regeneron are the remaining companies among the largest that haven't signed drug pricing deals. But Trump noted that Johnson & Johnson \"will be here next week.\" How the drug pricing deals will workThe full terms of the deals were not immediately released, which makes it unclear how broad their impact will be.The nine drugmakers agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest \"most favored nation\" prices, and guaranteeing that pricing for new medicines. Trump said the drugmakers also agreed to list their most popular drugs on his upcoming direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, which is launching in January. Some companies also launched new or expanded existing direct-to-consumer offerings for certain drugs. For example, Gilead said in a release that it will launch a program that will enable patients to access its hepatitis C treatment and cure, Epclusa, at a discounted price. Sanofi said it will offer discounts of nearly 70% on certain medicines to treat infections and cardiovascular and diabetic conditions on TrumpRx and other direct-to-consumer platforms. Merck said it will offer three diabetes medications, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR, at a roughly 70% discount to cash-paying patients through a direct-to-patient program. That program will be extended to the company's experimental daily cholesterol pill if it gets approved in the U.S., according to the company. \"I reflect on your goal of driving affordability and access to Americans, but equally, getting prices up outside the United States,\" Merck CEO Robert Davis said during the press conference. \"And we're 100% supportive of your actions.\" Meanwhile, Amgen will expand its existing direct-to-patient program to include preventative migraine medication Aimovig and autoimmune treatment Amjevita, at 60% and 80% discounted monthly prices, respectively. Earlier this year, Trump announced agreements with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from his planned pharmaceutical tariffs and other benefits, such as fast-tracked reviews of new drugs. U.S. prescription drug prices on average are nearly three times higher than overseas, according to a 2024 study by Rand Corp. Prices for branded drugs were more than four times higher, the report found. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive the policy of most favored nation, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"Trade association PhRMA, which represents many major pharma companies, has said that most-favored nation pricing isn't the best way to lower drug costs for Americans and instead blamed pharmacy benefit managers for the price disparity. The U.S. is the single most important market for many drugmakers, regardless of their home country. Despite being based across the Atlantic, European pharma companies are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, with half of the 10 largest companies on the Continent generating a majority of their sales in the U.S.",

    "body": "watch nowWhile discounts drove purchasing in the early days of the holiday shopping season, consumers are shifting into more thoughtful, quality gifts in the back half of the season as total spending growth slows.U.S. consumers had spent $187.3 billion so far online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, up 6.1% from the same stretch last year, according to Adobe Analytics. Total holiday season e-commerce spend is still expected to cross $253 billion, which would be 5.3% above last year, with the growth rate slowing later into December as delivery in time for Christmas gets tighter. E-commerce sales typically \"slow sharply\" from about Dec. 16 to Dec. 18, and then \"decline rapidly\" in the ensuing days, until Christmas Eve is the slowest shopping day of the season, Casey Armstrong, chief marketing officer for ShipBob, told CNBC. Armstrong said shopping picks up again on Dec. 27, which is typically the strongest day for ShipBob's customers late in the season. The company is a third-party logistics firm that ships for small, medium and social-oriented brands. A shopper carries packages in Union Square in San Francisco, Dec. 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFor shoppers who are willing to order online in the back half of the season, quality, rather than discounts, is driving interest. Captify analyzes more than 1 billion search events per day from 3 million websites, and it shows outsize search growth in apparel and athleisure brands including Alo Yoga, Warby Parker, Aritzia, Bombas and Quince into December compared to earlier in the season. Searches for Alo Yoga rose 256% for the period between Dec. 7 and Dec. 15 compared to the stretch from Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. Quince searches are up 124% for those same time frames. \"These gains point to a rise in thoughtful, quality-driven gifting as shoppers seek products from highly regarded brands\" said Oscar Chow, Captify head of insights for the U.S.RetailNext, which tracks in-store shopping, has also seen evidence of consumers valuing quality this season, even if that means buying fewer items. \"Consumers are willing to pay more to get those decisions right\" said Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext. The firm expects this dynamic to peak in the days leading up to Christmas.There is also evidence showing a shift toward gifting experiences and subscriptions as the season winds down. Chow said they offer shoppers a \"deadline-proof gift.\"Examples include growth in interest in the later weeks of the season for Roblox Robux, Cameo Kids, Kindle Unlimited, Strava Subscription, Peloton All-Access, MasterClass subscriptions and the Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max subscription bundle.Discounts are still available as holiday shopping winds down, but they're much lower than during Cyber Week highs. Adobe Analytics said toys will see the biggest promotions, peaking at 15% off list price in December, followed by furniture, bedding and televisions at 10% off.To be sure, there are discount-motivated consumers throughout the season, which makes toys a strong category. Data from Adobe and Captify show consumers are still seeking out Mattel's Barbie Dreamhouse, Disney's Stitch toys, and Play-Doh sets, among others. Armstrong said the Toniebox 2 audio player and the Ms. Rachel Tonies figurine is \"a top item driving buzz\".Stores save ChristmasA woman holds shopping bags as people make their way through Herald Square on Dec. 11, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesFor those that want a physical gift to give, stores are critical in the days leading up to Christmas.The last Saturday before Christmas has been coined \"Super Saturday\" by the retail sector and is often one of the top store shopping days of the year. But with Christmas landing on a Thursday this year, the volume will likely be lower on Super Saturday this year than on Dec. 22 through Dec. 24, according to RetailNext. \"We expect some of the highest conversion rates of the season to occur in the final days before Christmas, potentially rivaling or even surpassing Black Friday,\" Shasteen of RetailNext said. The warmer temperatures and dry conditions hitting much of the country this weekend should also help lift store traffic this weekend, according to Evan Gold, Planalytics executive vice president of global partnerships and alliances.Shoppers who don't want to navigate stores, but also don't want to chance shipping timelines, are increasingly using buy online, pick up in store options in the final stretch of the holiday shopping season. Adobe Analytics predicts BOPIS will peak on Dec. 22 and Dec. 23, with 32% to 37% of e-commerce orders utilizing the service, a spike in typical usage from the rest of the year.Kohl's told CNBC its pickup orders more than double in the week leading up to Christmas and that a quarter of shoppers who pickup an online order end up buying something else while they are there. At Bath and Body Works, about 30% of customers picking up online orders add something before checkout. It's also a cost savings for retailers to fulfill online orders from stores. Target has said order pickup or drive-up saves the retailer 90% over brown-box delivery from fulfillment centers. So far this season, three-quarters of its digital orders have been picked up from stores.Walmart told CNBC last year that weekly scheduled pickup volume increased 14% in the two weeks leading up to Christmas compared to the average volume in the prior 12 weeks. More than 80% of Walmart customers say they shop in-store in the three days before Christmas, according to its customer insights and strategy holiday pulse tracker conducted this month.Last December, volumes of Walmart Express Delivery, orders fulfilled from store inventory that come with an extra fee, reached 2.5 times the monthly average. The retailer said on Christmas Eve alone, 77% of digital orders were fulfilled via the express option.While Dick's Sporting Goods declined to share specifics, the retailer said it sees a \"significant uptick in BOPIS\" as Christmas nears, and it also sees an \"attach rate\" for shoppers \"to make sure they grab those last-minute gifts on a single trip to the store.\"",

    "body": "watch nowNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday that \"technical factors\" likely distorted November's inflation data, pushing the headline reading lower than it otherwise would have been.\"There were some special factors or practical factors that really are related to the fact that they weren't able to collect data in October and not in the first half of November. And because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the CPI reading, probably by a tenth or so,\" Williams said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"It's hard to know, we'll get some when we'll get to December data, I think we'll get a better reading of how much that distortion, how big the effect was, but I do think that that was pushed down a bit by these technical factors,\" he added.The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%.Williams said the data may have a downward bias because it was collected mainly in the second half of November, when sales were widespread, and noted there were also complications with rent and other categories. The New York Fed president said he took some comfort from categories not affected by those issues, seeing cooling price pressures in certain sectors.\"Some of the data that we're seeing is actually pretty encouraging in the sense of the CPI news. and I think it represents a continuation of the disinflationary process we've seen,\" Williams said.Because the October CPI release was canceled, Thursday's report lacked several of the standard data points typically included in a CPI report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it could not go back and collect October survey data, though it relied on \"nonsurvey data sources\" to construct the index. As a result, economists may be cautious about interpreting the report as clear evidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path, given the absence of an October comparison. Economists believe some some inputs to the owners' equivalent rent calculation for the canceled October month were estimated by the BLS to have zero inflation, distorting that calculation downward.",

    "body": "Anand Varadarajan, Amazon Vice President of product and technology and worldwide grocery stores speaks during the Delivering the future conference in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, on October 9, 2024.Seth Herald | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks announced Friday that it has hired its new chief technology officer, Amazon veteran Anand Varadarajan. Varadarajan, who spent nearly 19 years at Amazon, most recently led technology and supply chain for the tech giant's worldwide grocery stores business.Varadarajan, who also previously held software engineering roles at Oracle, will begin Jan. 19 as executive vice president and CTO, reporting directly to CEO Brian Niccol, according to a memo. The hire comes after Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' former CTO, departed in September as the company underwent a second round of layoffs and announced a $1 billion restructuring plan as a part of its ongoing turnaround. \"[Varadarajan] knows how to create systems that are reliable and secure, drive operational excellence and scale solutions that keep customers at the center. Just as important, he cares deeply about supporting and developing the people behind the scenes that build and enable the technology we use,\" Niccol wrote in a memo announcing the hiring. At Amazon, Varadarajan had recently been elevated to oversee the worldwide grocery technology and supply chain organizations, which include both its homegrown Fresh brand and Whole Foods. He reported directly to Jason Buechel, Amazon's grocery chief and the CEO of Whole Foods. During his tenure, Amazon has experimented further with grocery tech innovations like a pilot to incorporate mini robotic warehouses in Whole Foods supermarkets that enable consumers to shop both its in-store selection and products from Amazon's wider inventory that aren't typically stocked by the organic grocer.Starbucks, meanwhile, is still in the early stages of a turnaround overseen by Niccol, who took over as CEO in September 2024. In the most recent quarter, Starbucks' quarterly same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years, a sign that its strategy is winning over lapsed customers. Holiday sales have also been strong so far this season as the company contends with an ongoing strike of unionized baristas impacting a small number of its stores.Part of that strategy is its hospitality platform, Green Apron Service, which at $500 million is the company's largest investment into labor. The program is backed by changes to ensure proper staffing and better technology to keep service times fast. It was born out of growth in digital orders — which now make up more than 30% of sales — and feedback from baristas.watch now— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report",

    "body": "UnitedHealthcare sign is displayed at its office building in Minnetonka, Minnesota, U.S., Dec. 11, 2025. Tim Evans | ReutersUnitedHealth Group on Friday released the first results from a sprawling independent audit of its business practices and committed to a wide range of steps to track and implement improvements in three specific areas. The health-care giant said it has adopted 23 ongoing \"action plans\" to put in place and monitor recommended improvements, with oversight by its internal audit and advisory services team. Around 65% of those actions will be complete by the end of 2025, while 100% of those plans will be finished by the end of March next year. The results come as private insurers try to rebuild trust with the American public after fierce, pent-up backlash over their practices and the broader U.S. health-care system. Critics say insurer business tactics have made it harder for some patients to access and pay for care. The company owns UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest and most powerful insurer. While the announcement on Friday is a step toward improving the business, it's unclear how much it will change the public's view on the company and the broader industry.UnitedHealth in July announced that two independent consultancies had launched a third-party review of its business policies and performance metrics. That same day, UnitedHealth also confirmed that it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices. The independent audit marked one of Steve Hemsley's earliest steps as CEO after he took the reins in May, following the abrupt departure of Andrew Witty.\"We hope that you see these assessments as a commitment to setting a new standard of transparency for the health care marketplace, as we believe that you and every person who engages with our health system deserves to understand how we go about our work,\" Hemsley said in a letter Friday. \"We know that our actions and decisions have significant impacts on patients, care providers and the broader health system, and we are determined to hold ourselves to the highest standard,\" he added. FTI Consulting reviewed UnitedHealthcare's approaches to risk assessment operations within its Medicare Advantage programs, which refers to how the company rates the health status of members in those privately run plans. The firm also examined the company's care services management policies, procedures and processes. Consulting firm the Analysis Group also assessed the policies and processes of Optum Rx – the company's pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM  – for ensuring prescription discounts from drug manufacturers are \"accurately collected and distributed to clients.\" PBMs are middlemen who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, create lists of medications covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions.Hemsley said the firms determined that the company's policies and practices are \"robust, rigorous and generally sound; and, in many respects, industry leading.\" But he noted that they also provided recommendations for improvements. For example, a review by the Analysis Group found that OptumRx has \"implemented a comprehensive and well-structured framework that governs all stages of manufacturer discount administration.\" More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe assessment identified at least 25 distinct \"controls\" in place that collectively lower the risk of miscalculating or delaying the distribution of discounts owed to clients and collecting incomplete discounts from drugmakers, said Aaron Yeater, managing principal at the Boston office of Analysis Group, in a document Friday. The review found \"no deficiencies or need for corrective measures\" but recommended ways to enhance Optum Rx's practices. That includes strengthening Optum Rx's escalation processes for resolving nonpayment and dispute cases through communication with manufacturers. Among UnitedHealth's action plans is to develop a formal policy that supports procedures for addressing those cases. Yeater noted that he examined the business processes and not the legal and regulatory issues the company is facing with its PBM. Meanwhile, FTI Consulting found that UnitedHealth scored better than its peers by several measures when it came to Medicaid and Medicare. But the firm pointed to slow decision-making on authorizations, documentation issues and the need to better address the findings raised in regulatory audits. Beyond these first results, UnitedHealth said it will share the findings from a review of medical records of diagnosis codes during the first quarter. The company will also report on its processes to craft what it calls \"evidence-based medical policy\" by the middle of the year. Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down more than 35% for the year after it suspended its 2025 forecast amid skyrocketing medical costs, announced the surprise exit of Witty and grappled with the probes into its Medicare Advantage business. It followed a difficult 2024 marked by a historic cyberattack and public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson.Correction: UnitedHealth Group had a difficult 2024. An earlier version misstated the year. ",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, stubbornly high mortgage rates and now less supply are all weighing on potential homebuyers. Sales of previously owned homes rose just 0.5% in November from October and were 1% lower than November 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales came in at an annualized rate of 4.13 million units.This count is based on closings, so it reflects contracts likely signed in September and October, when mortgage rates initially came down slightly but then stayed in a tight range.   Supply, which had been gaining for much of this year, fell in November. There were 1.43 million homes for sale at the end of the month, down 5.9% from October but up 7.5% year over year, according to the association. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.2-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \"Inventory growth is beginning to stall,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, said in a release. \"With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Sellers who were on the market also began to delist their properties at a higher rate than usual. Sellers often take unsold homes off the market heading into winter, but that dynamic was much stronger this year. And that is keeping pressure on home prices. The median price of a home sold in November was $409,200, an increase of 1.2% from November 2024, and the highest November reading on record. The Realtors use a median measurement, which can skew to what end of the market is selling most. The high end is currently doing much better than the low end. Sales of homes priced in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down nearly 8% from a year ago, while homes priced at more than $1 million were up 1.4%.\"Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,\" Yun said.Homes are staying on the market longer, at 36 days compared with 32 days last November. First-time homebuyers made up 30% of sales, unchanged from a year ago, but historically they make up about 40%. Investors stepped back into the market, making up 18% of transactions, up from 13% in November 2024.",

    "body": "A shopper carries Nike bags in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.  David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike shares fell more than 10% in premarket trading on Friday morning, as concerns about its performance in China outweighed the sportswear giant's earnings beat. On Thursday, Nike posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, as strength in North America helped to offset a plunge in China sales.The stock movement comes as investors digest the weakness reported in China and the sustained hit Nike is taking from higher tariffs.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNike share priceHere's what Nike reported for its second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.22 billion expectedThe athletic apparel retailer said sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion. But revenue in its Greater China market dropped 17% to $1.42 billion.The company reported net income of $792 million, a 32% drop from $1.16 billion in the prior-year period. Revenue rose 1% to $12.43 billion from $12.35 billion.Shares of German athleisure giants Adidas and Puma also took a small hit on Friday morning, as concerns about Nike's performance spilled over to companies across the Atlantic.Investors in Western consumer discretionary companies, like sportswear and luxury goods makers, are closely monitoring the shape of the critical Chinese market, where consumer demand has been volatile for some time after slowing sharply in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Adidas reported 10% growth in China revenues in its third-quarter earnings report. In its third-quarter earnings report, Puma said sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 9% due to a \"significant decline\" in the Greater China wholesale business. Nike's turnaround progressNike is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.\"Fiscal year '26 continues to be a year of taking action to rightsize our classics business, return Nike digital to a premium experience, diversify our product portfolio, deepen our consumer connection, strengthen our partner relationships and realign our teams and leadership,\" Hill said on a call with analysts. \"And I say we're in the middle inning of our comeback.\"\"We're nowhere near our potential,\" he added.Hill said Nike's improvements in its China market are \"not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,\" though he said the country remains one of the company's most powerful long-term opportunities.Nike expects fiscal third quarter revenues to fall by a low single digit percentage, with modest growth in North America. It also anticipates gross margins will drop 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points – including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.The company said wholesale revenues climbed 8% to $7.5 billion during the quarter. But direct sales — which were a focus for Nike in the years before Hill took over and moved away from the strategy — fell 8% to $4.6 billion.Nike has also been feeling the impact of tariff increases. It said Thursday that its gross margin decreased by 3 percentage points and inventories dropped 3% primarily due to higher tariffs.watch nowThe sneaker company has been reporting weakness in its Converse brand, too. In its first fiscal quarter, Nike said Converse sales dropped 27% – on Thursday, it reported a 30% drop in revenues for the sneaker brand. Despite the weakness in some parts of Nike's business, the company highlighted some areas of strength and new initiatives ahead. CFO Matt Friend said on the call that Nike.com posted its best Black Friday ever this year, partially driven by its Air Jordan \"Black Cat\" launch.Nike also plans to launch a new footwear platform in January called Nike Mind, which aims to help athletes prepare for performance and competition, Hill said on the call.Nike has been making larger internal changes under Hill.Earlier this month, Nike underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shakeup a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.Nike shares were already down more than 13% this year-to-date at Thursday's close.In a note following the earnings update, Citi analysts said Nike's performance in China weighed on their expectations for the company's broader recovery. \"Management expects 2Q China weakness to continue for the remainder of [2026] as they reset the market place (which will take time),\" they said. \"This keeps us cautious on the [2027] recovery and highlights the complicated turnaround underway.\"",

    "body": "Global data centers dealmaking surged to hit another record high this year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads.That surge came even as investors grew increasingly wary of inflated artificial intelligence valuations and the financing underpinning the rapid expansion of data centers. Global stocks sold off in November as worries of an AI-fueled bubble persisted.But S&P Global reported that more than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market this year, up slightly from $60.8 billion last year, amid what it called a \"global construction frenzy.\"A surge in debt financing contributed to the record high as hyperscalers increasingly tap private equity markets rather than funding the expensive infrastructure themselves. That trend has sparked concerns from some investors as they question the value of the advanced tech that data centers house.Shares of cloud company Oracle fell 5% on Wednesday following a report that Blue Owl Capital was pulling out of a deal to back a $10 billion data center in Michigan. Oracle has denied the report, but Broadcom, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices retreated after it was published. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.81% in its worst day in nearly a month.Iuri Struta, TMT analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said his team expects market concerns around AI and Oracle to be temporary and unlikely to have a \"massive impact\" on data center buildout and M&A in the near future.\"The competitive dynamic among frontier AI model providers, like OpenAI, Alphabet and Anthropic, is changing quickly, and this can have an impact on investor sentiment in public markets. But overall, we see demand for AI applications continuing to grow strongly in 2026.\"watch nowDespite the recent pullback in AI stocks, many analysts remain bullish on the sector. ING expects secular trends to point to healthy investment levels in 2026 driven by AI advancements and growing public and private support for digital innovation.\"There are two sides to the development of AI, one that would cater for optimism such as faster development of medicine and at the same time there would be concerns typically around (public) safety,\" Wim Steenbakkers, global head of datacenters and technology at ING, told CNBC.\"Hence uncertainty remains around the monetisation of the technology and business models. Questions around the high levels of investment will only be answered in the future when the uncertainties diminish and the applications of the technology and its advantages become clearer.\"There were more than 100 data center transactions in the first 11 months of the year, whose total value already exceeds all the deals done in 2024, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The majority of those deals took place in the U.S., followed by the Asia-Pacific region.\"In Europe, the buildout of data centers is expected to grow at a lower rate than other regions, but it remains to be seen if this results in an M&A rush amid scarcity of assets,\" Struta said.The pace of growth in the U.S. is leaving Europe \"in the dust\" according to a recent report from ING which predicted data center investment in the U.S. could be fivefold higher. Growth is also increasingly coming from the Middle East, as the wealthy Gulf States look to position themselves as the next global AI hub.Debt issuance nearly doubles in 2025Debt issuance nearly doubled to $182 billion in 2025, up from $92 billion last year, according to the data from S&P. It noted that Meta and Google were among the most active issuers, with Facebook's owner raising $62 billion in debt since 2022 — nearly half of that total was issued in 2025 alone.Google and Amazon raised $29 billion and $15 billion, respectively, according to the report, which noted that hyperscalers are increasingly working with AI labs to buy assets to finance construction in an \"unusual arrangement\" that underscores the significant capital required to meet demand.Struta expects more \"robust\" M&A investment activity in the data center space in 2026.\"I wouldn't be surprised if already high valuations get even higher,\" he told CNBC. \"The buildout of new data centers can be temporarily tempered by a lack of energy supply, making already built data centers more valuable. As the availability of large data center companies remains scarce, we could see more asset sales by companies that don't view data centers as their core business.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's move Thursday to sign an executive order easing federal restrictions on marijuana — and clearing the way for a Medicare pilot program covering CBD — caps a coordinated, yearlong push by the cannabis industry that combined traditional lobbying, sizable political donations, data-driven messaging and direct outreach to the president's inner circle, industry insiders told CNBC.Despite long-standing GOP opposition to loosening drug laws — including a small wave of bills from lawmakers seeking to tighten rules after the executive order — industry advocates have claimed a victory. They see the order as a success in reframing marijuana not as a social issue, but as a pro-business policy, ultimately winning over a president famous for his sobriety.\"I've never been inundated by so many people as I have about\" reclassifying marijuana, Trump said during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office on Thursday.Three figures emerged as the primary architects of this policy shift, according to multiple insiders, including one CEO of a cannabis company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. The key players were Howard Kessler, a Palm Beach billionaire and longtime friend of the president; Kim Rivers, the CEO of cannabis giant Trulieve; and Tony Fabrizio, Trump's longtime pollster, the people said.The billionaireU.S. President Donald Trump displays an executive order with Howard Kessler (R) that Trump signed in the Oval Office of the White House on December 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesKessler, known for pioneering affinity credit cards, has been in Trump's orbit since at least 2005, attending Trump's wedding to Melania Trump and appearing at Mar-a-Lago and state dinners. A leukemia survivor, Kessler began advocating for the medical benefits of cannabis for seniors in 2019, founding The Commonwealth Project to advance the cause. In September, Trump shared a Commonwealth Project video on Truth Social that said CBD coverage was \"the most important senior health initiative of the century.\"Other prominent members of the Trump administration noted Kessler's influence on Thursday. During the signing ceremony, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, \"We wouldn't be here today\" without Kessler.\"God bless you for being a pain in our sides,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, joked to Kessler in the Oval Office. Oz added that Kessler had promised to finally stop calling the president about the issue once the order was signed.Kessler did not respond to a request for comment. The White House said Trump's executive order would open up access for new treatments. \"The presence of several leaders from law enforcement and veterans groups at the Oval Office signing is indicative of how President Trump continues to push the envelope to support our nation's heroes,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.The industry CEOKim Rivers, CEO of Trulieve, one of the largest U.S. cannabis companies, has also cultivated a close relationship with the Trump administration, people familiar with the matter told CNBC, specifically through a personal connection with Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles.Although Wiles was not a registered lobbyist for Trulieve, she previously worked at Ballard Partners, a Florida lobbying firm that represents the company. \"They [the Trump administration] want to see safe, regulated, tested products,\" Rivers told CNBC's \"Fast Monday\" Thursday night, adding that she's interpreting the White House's language as a signal that the administration intends to rein in a chaotic market rather than expand it unchecked. watch now\"Millions of Americans are using medical cannabis,\" Rivers said. \"The president is very clear that he wants folks to be able to have access to safe, regulated, researched products in controlled environments.\"Rivers attended two pre-inauguration events, including a dinner for Vice President JD Vance, and reportedly joined a $1 million-a-plate fundraiser at Trump's New Jersey golf club in August, where she urged him to reclassify marijuana, the Wall Street Journal first reported.Trulieve's campaign spending also backed Trump. Federal Election Commission filings show Trulieve donated $750,000 to Trump's inauguration committee and $250,000 to his MAGA Inc. super PAC.The company reportedly played a key role in securing Trump's backing for a Florida ballot initiative to legalize recreational cannabis for adults over 21. While the initiative failed, Florida Division of Elections records show Trulieve spent more than $100 million on the election.The pollsterThe president also received data from his pollster, Fabrizio, who has his own ties to the issue.American Rights and Reform, a cannabis-backed super PAC, paid six figures to the firm Fabrizio leads to run a poll that found broad voter support for rescheduling, according to FEC filings.During the signing ceremony Thursday, Trump referenced Fabrizio's data multiple times, highlighting a survey published in March that illustrated broad voter support for loosening restrictions. The data showed that young voters, aged 18 to 34, were the leading majority in supporting reform at about 80%. Fabrizio's son, AJ Fabrizio, is also a vocal figure in the cannabis industry and a CEO who has said he turned to medical marijuana to treat his own epilepsy.AJ Fabrizio created his own cannabis extract brand called IVXX — a line of carbon dioxide-extracted hash oil made exclusively for Terra Tech Corp., a publicly traded cannabis company that owns dispensaries such as The Green Door in San Francisco and Blum in Oakland, California.In interviews, AJ has described moving from skepticism to advocacy after cannabis stopped his seizures.  He has also compared the future of cannabis to \"Standard Oil\" — arguing in a recent podcast interview that just as Rockefeller turned oil byproducts into a petrochemical empire, the cannabis industry is poised to revolutionize materials, medicine and nutrition.",

    "body": "U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a House Homeland Security hearing entitled \"Worldwide Threats to the Homeland,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.  Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program at President Donald Trump's direction, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro, 47, in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery. Visas are randomly allocated to individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.— Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, worth some $56 billion when it vested, must be restored, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Friday.\"We reverse the Court of Chancery's rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages,\" the judges wrote in their opinion. In the decision, the Delaware Supreme Court judges said a lower court's decision to cancel Musk's 2018 pay plan was too extreme a remedy and that the lower court did not give Tesla a chance to say what a fair compensation ought to be.The decision on the appeal in this case, known as Tornetta v. Musk, likely ends the yearslong fight over Musk's record-setting compensation. Musk's net worth is currently estimated at around $679.4 billion, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School, told CNBC that while the Friday opinion may restore the 2018 pay plan for Musk, it leaves the rest of the lower court's decision unaddressed and intact. \"The court had previously decided that Musk was a controlling shareholder of Tesla and that the Tesla board and he arranged an unfair pay plan for him,\" she said. \"None of that was reversed in this decision.\"\"We are proud to have participated in the historic verdict below, calling to account the Tesla board and its largest stockholder for their breaches of fiduciary duty,\" lawyers representing plaintiff Richard J. Tornetta said in an e-mailed statement.Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Delaware Supreme Court issued the order per curiam with no single judge taking credit for writing the opinion and no dissent noted.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Nvidia VC arms back vibe coding startup Lovable at $6.6 billion valuationMetaX and Moore Threads' IPOs underscore Chinese chipmakers' growing challenge to NvidiaInstacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing toolAmazon says AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving, Peter DeSantis to lead 'AGI' groupMusk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, comprised of 12 milestone-based tranches of stock, was unprecedented at the time it was proposed. After it was granted, the pay plan made Musk the wealthiest individual in the world.Tesla shareholder Tornetta sued Tesla, filing a derivative action in 2018, accusing Musk and the company's board of a breach of their fiduciary duties. Delaware's business-specialized Court of Chancery decided in January 2024 that the pay plan was improperly granted and ordered it to be rescinded.In her decision, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick also found that Musk \"controlled Tesla,\" and that the process leading to the board's approval of his 2018 pay plan was \"deeply flawed.\" Among other things, she found the Tesla board did not disclose all the material information they should have to investors before asking them to vote on and approve the plan.After the earlier Tornetta ruling, Musk moved Tesla's site of incorporation out of Delaware, bashed McCormick by name in posts on his social network X, formerly Twitter, where he has tens of millions of followers, and called for other entrepreneurs to reincorporate outside of the state.Tesla also attempted to \"ratify\" the 2018 CEO pay plan by holding a second vote with shareholders in 2024. In November, Tesla shareholders voted to approve an even larger CEO compensation plan for Musk. The 2025 pay plan consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted to the CEO if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade and is worth about $1 trillion in total. The new plan could also increase Musk's voting power over the company from around 13% today to around 25%. Shareholders had also approved a plan to replace Musk's 2018 CEO pay if the Tornetta decision was upheld on appeal. That plan is now nullified.As CNBC previously reported, a law firm that currently represents Tesla in this appeal penned a bill to overhaul corporate law in Delaware earlier this year. The bill was passed by the Delaware legislature in March, and if it had applied retroactively, it could have affected the outcome of this case.Read the Delaware Supreme Court's ruling here. watch now",

Oracle and OpenAI in particular have raised eyebrows, as the ChatGPT maker committed to pay more than $300 billion to the software company. Cramer suggested investors grew concerned after Oracle raised $18 billion in its September bond sale — one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry.OpenAI should \"strike while the iron's hot and try to raise $200 billion at a trillion dollar valuation,\" Cramer said. That funding will allow the company to pay Oracle the money it needs now to build data centers, he continued. If that happens, he said, other hyperscalers will have to keep spending on infrastructure, and data centers stocks can take off.Cramer said he's fairly optimistic OpenAI can raise the money. But the outfit has \"monster hubris,\" he continued, and suggested now could be a \"humbling moment\" for the company, or it could \"demonstrate that they're right to be arrogant.\"\"Even if OpenAI raises, say $100 billion now in a private round and then comes back for a public round for another $100 billion next year, the data center theme could continue to hum,\" he said. \"Of course, if Open AI can't raise enough money, then we just reverse everything we saw today, and we go back down.\"OpenAI and Oracle did not immediately respond to request for comment.watch now",

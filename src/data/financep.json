    "body": "Working for (or with) someone who scrutinizes everything you do and demands that you run it past them for approval can push anyone to the brink. But don't despair. I'm the author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need From the People in Charge,\" a human behavior professor, and an executive coach who's spent the last 15 years coaching leaders at Google, Amazon, and other Fortune 500 companies.I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be for people to navigate the challenges of working with a control freak. I teach them some simple strategies to make the situation work in their favor — without leaving them exhausted and frustrated every day.If you also work for a controlling and impatient taskmaster, try these five steps:1. Run with rough draftsRather than toiling away for days — or weeks — to craft the perfect deliverable, do a first pass and say, \"Here's what I've put together so far. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I wanted to capture the core ideas and structure so we can shape it into something outstanding.\" Your boss will be happy to have input, and you'll conserve your energy.2. Reinforce their authorityUse phrases like, \"What we ultimately do is up to you,\" or, \"I'll share my two cents so that you can make the final decision.\" This allows you to emphasize you know who's the boss. Pose your ideas as inquiries. Try, \"What if…\" or, \"How about we…\" Asking questions in conversation boosts feelings of control in the other person, which is called the question-behavior effect in psychology. 3. OvershareSend a breakdown of items you plan to tackle each week every Monday or shoot over a quick heads-up if you'll be late to a meeting. While sometimes tedious, sharing this information will satiate your boss's desire for oversight, while saving you the effort of justifying yourself later. You might share your update with: \"To keep you in the loop about our progress, I've prepped a weekly status memo with a snapshot of recent developments.\" Or say: \"I'm confirming that we're moving ahead with [X]. Let me know by Friday if there are any changes.\"4. Get ahead of their criticismYou might say, \"I'm planning to approach [X task] this way. Do you have initial thoughts?\" When your boss corrects you, use the classic \"yes, and…\" improv technique. Acknowledge their input (\"yes\") and then add your perspective or suggestion (\"and\") to subtly assert your ideas while taking their feedback into account. It might sound like this: \"Yes, I appreciate the need to be more concise in my emails, and I believe a brief context section is still beneficial for clarity, especially for people less familiar with the project.\"5. Ask for the praise you needTry emphasizing the significance of their approval: \"I enjoy hearing how I can improve. It's also important for me to know what's going well so I can do more of that. Is there room for you to share your perspective on what I'm getting right, or do you prefer to keep the focus on what needs adjusting?\"Melody Wilding, LMSW is an executive coach, human behavior professor, and author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.\" Get her free training, 5 Steps to Speak Like a Senior Leader, here. Want to catch up on our CNBC Make It Book Club discussion with Melody Wilding?

Cleveland Works steel mill in Cleveland, Ohio, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCleveland-Cliffs is looking into building a rare earths mining business, CEO Lourenco Goncalves told investors Monday.The steelmaker has two sites in Michigan and Minnesota where geological surveys have found indications of rare earths, Goncalves said in a statement on Cleveland-Cliffs' third-quarter earnings.\"We are working with the geologists to assess whether these deposits could become commercially viable — that's where we are at,\" Goncalves told analysts on the company's earnings call later Monday morning. \"We are a mining company, this isn't new territory for us.\"Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs were trading about 17% higher. The Cleveland, Ohio headquartered steelmaker is experienced in mining iron ore.Rare earths are used to manufacture magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, semiconductor fabrication, robotics and other applications.China dominates the global rare earth supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports. China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation.The U.S. has only one commercial rare earth mine. The Defense Department struck a deal in July with the mine's owner, MP Materials, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors have been speculating that the Trump administration will strike similar deals with other U.S. companies that are trying to stand up domestic rare earths mines and processing facilities.Cleveland-Cliffs' sites in Michigan and Minnesota, if sucessful, would align the company with the administration's \"broader national strategy for critical mineral independence,\" Goncalves said.\"American manufacturing shouldn't rely on China or any foreign nation for essential minerals, and Cliffs intends to be part of the solution,\" the CEO said.",

    "body": "In September, The Economist released its third annual \"Carrie Bradshaw index,\" named after the protagonist of the hit TV show \"Sex and the City.\" The report ranks the U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live alone.The index was named after the character because, on the show, she lives in a studio apartment in the West Village and it is highly unlikely that she could afford it on a writer's salary now, Lizzy Peet, a data researcher at The Economist, tells CNBC Make It.\"It all came about from a sort of snappy way to sum up the aspiration, a sort of quality of living by yourself in a big city for the first time. How much would you have to earn to afford that? And how much is that a realist prospect?\" she says.To rank the U.S. cities, The Economist used the rule that a tenant should spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. That, in combination with using rental prices from Zumper, led to the calculation of the salary needed to afford a typical studio in each city. Each city was given a \"Bradshaw score\" where a value more than one means an average studio apartment is affordable and less than one means housing is unaffordable.\"Cities that build a lot or maybe that have less demand or maybe have less population demand on rent are the kind of cities that are looking more affordable,\" Peet says.One big change in this year's index is that some cities that were affordable last year have slid into the unaffordable category this year, Peet adds.A lot of cities in Texas, like Dallas, Houston, and Austin, moved from what was deemed affordable to what is now deemed unaffordable.\"There are loads of factors at work here. It's important to know that rental markets can be quite random, but they can fluctuate a lot in a very short space of time,\" Peet says. \"It's pretty well documented that Texas has seen this influx of middle-class workers, and that would drive rent up.\"In this year's index, 41 cities were unaffordable, up from 38 cities last year.Wichita, KansasCweimer4 | E+ | Getty Images10 U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live aloneWichita, Kan.Baton Rouge, La.Lincoln, Neb.Des Moines, IowaAkron, OhioTucson, Ariz.Tulsa, Okla.St. Louis, Mo.Albuquerque, N.M.Aurora, Colo.Wichita, Kansas, is the most affordable city in the index. It has a Bradshaw score of around 1.75, which means that median wages in the city are 75% higher than needed to afford an average studio apartment.The average monthly rent for studio apartments in Wichita is $580, up 1.64% from last month, but down 10.54% year-over-year, according to Zumper.Residents of Wichita need to earn $26,400 a year to afford a studio, which is $20,250 less than the median wage.\"I'm not that surprised Wichita is the most affordable. A lot of the cities in the bottom 10 are off the beaten track and not huge economic powerhouses. It's an interesting dynamic,\" Peet says.\"There are still some perhaps less desirable cities that are surprisingly unaffordable and vice versa.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "When it comes to the workplace, \"just be yourself\" is bad advice, according to psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic.Authenticity is often touted as a desirable trait, says Chamorro-Premuzic, who is a professor of business psychology at Columbia University, but if you're hoping to boost your career, you're better off mastering skills like tact and self-control.Having high emotional intelligence, which Chamorro-Premuzic defines as \"the ability to understand and manage yourself and others,\" is a \"fundamental currency\" in the workplace, he says.\"It makes you more employable, and it makes you more rewarding to deal with,\" he says.People who are successful at work know how to blend \"social skills, empathy and attention to others' perception,\" as Chamorro-Premuzic says in his latest book \"Don't Be Yourself: Why Authenticity Is Overrated (and What to Do Instead),\" published on Oct. 7.According to Chamorro-Premuzic, these are the top three social skills everyone should practice in the workplace. or building social connections and growing your career.1. Being receptive to feedbackThe most successful people Chamorro-Premuzic knows \"solicit honest, critical feedback from others, particularly those who are in a position to judge what you do, and who are comfortable enough to tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear,\" he says.Most people are primed to offer positive feedback, rather than honest observations, he says, so asking the right questions is key.Instead of saying 'How was my presentation?' Chamorro-Premuzic recommends putting a finer point on your query.\"The way to ask is, what could I have done better? What could I have done differently? What would you have done differently in my situation?\" he says.It's crucial to maintain your composure while listening to criticism, Chamorro-Premuzic says: otherwise, you're unlikely to receive honest feedback again.\"It's difficult, but if you have the courage to invite negative, constructive, critical feedback, you're going to close the gap between how good you think you are and how good you actually are,\" he says.2. Social awarenessBeing socially savvy can have major benefits for your career, Chamorro-Premuzic says.When navigating workplace dynamics, a crucial tactic he recommends is to \"focus less on yourself\" and more on other people.Being able to identify and respond to others' feelings is a key component of emotional intelligence, he says. Socially aware people are able to analyze an interpersonal situation and adjust their behavior without seeming phony.Chamorro-Premuzic calls this skill \"strategic self-presentation\": \"making an effort to act in a prosocial way and take into account what other people expect.\"Being attuned to others' feelings and needs will make you stand out from the crowd, he says: \"Other people are only thinking about themselves, so if you think about them, you have a big advantage.\"3. AdaptabilityIt's tempting to play to your strengths, Chamorro-Premuzic says, but enduring discomfort while learning new skills will help you grow.A key trait of successful people is that they're willing to say \"I'm going to try to do things differently, or try something else out even if I don't like it,\" he says.All too often, we view traits like introversion, flexibility or sociability as permanent aspects of our personalities, but that belief can prevent us from developing new skills.\"If you're limiting your choices and your decisions to your past and present selves, you're not going to create a future self that is richer, more diverse, broader,\" he says.It may feel \"unpleasant and difficult\" to leave your comfort zone, Chamorro-Premuzic says, but it will ultimately open up new avenues for your career.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "Jim Cramer can't guarantee that following certain financial strategies will see you to a secure retirement, but he's pretty sure of a few that won't.In the preface of his book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market,\" Cramer issues a few warnings about building long-term wealth. One is that your confidence \"might be misplaced\" if you plan on relying on Social Security to fund your retirement. Another is that betting on the outcome of basketball games is not a solid investing strategy.\"Third, and maybe worst of all, trolling the internet for 'meme' stocks like GameStop and hunting for short-term victories in the hope of long-term financial stability is an easy road to disaster,\" he writes.A \"meme\" stock is a stock that gains sudden popularity on the internet, leading to skyrocketing prices. Cramer cautioned investors about such investments during GameStop's original Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in 2021, during which GameStop stock went from less than a dollar per share to an intraday high of $120.75, adjusted for splits.Cramer says the backlash from some investors was fierce enough that he hired private security. But many investors who didn't heed his warning got burned: By 2024, GameStop stock traded in the neighborhood of $10 a share. It's currently trading around $20.Cramer's warnings about GameStop and other meme stocks comes down to what investing pros call the \"greater fool\" theory. Investors buy overpriced assets they know aren't long-term winners in the hopes of selling at a higher price to someone else.Cramer has another analogy about investing in meme stocks. \"When you buy the kind of stock like GameStop, that is just literally a musical chairs game,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"And I'm against musical chairs and I'm pro-investing.\"In other words, if you get into risky short-term trades, you could end up without a seat and lose a lot of money when the music stops.Avoid trading in favor of investingNone of that is to say that Cramer doesn't want you to speculate — he does. Cramer advocates for dedicating a small percentage of your portfolio to stocks you think have the chance to deliver huge returns, even at a substantial risk of loss. But he wants even your long-shot stock picks to be fundamentally strong companies that you plan to hold for the long term.Meme stocks, which investors tend to hold solely in the hope that the price will go up, and not based on underlying fundamentals, are unlikely to fit the bill, Cramer says.\"I like you to get in, and, if it's a really good company, you stay in,\" he says. \"But GameStop was not a good company. That was simply people who were just chasing.\"When thinking about a prospective investment, Cramer suggests asking yourself whether you're envisioning a transaction with a beginning and an end.\"If it has a beginning and an end, I say don't own it, because I want owning. I don't want trading,\" Cramer says. \"Trading is for people who professionally traded like I did for 20 years.\"To build wealth, he says, you're better off choosing investments that you expect to deliver consistent growth over the course of decades. Such firms should have bright long-term prospects, underpinned by growing earnings, innovative products or services, and durable competitive advantages over peers.\"My version of investing may not give you the instant high of a short-term 'victory' that will eventually come crashing down,\" Cramer writes in his book. \"But buying and holding shares in best-of-breed companies can compound your money in spectacular fashion over time.\"Upgrade to an annual CNBC Investing Club membership today and claim your free, signed copy of Jim Cramer's new book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market.\" (See terms and conditions for complete offer details.

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has agreed to cancel student debt under programs it had partially blocked, reopening a path to student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers.The outcome is the result of an agreement reached on Friday between the U.S. Department of Education and the American Federation of Teachers, a union.In the agreement, the Trump administration said it will again process student loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers in two income-driven repayment plans — the original Income-Contingent Repayment plan and the Pay as You Earn plan — as long as those programs remain in effect.President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" will phase out ICR and PAYE as of July 1, 2028.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump administration agrees to deliver more student loan forgivenessWhat Medicare beneficiaries need to consider during open enrollmentWhat student loan borrowers can and can't do, as the shutdown stretches onThese ETF mistakes can 'quietly erode long-term returns,' advisor saysACA enhanced subsidy lapse could hit early retirees hardest amid shutdown fightWhy some credit card APRs aren't coming down, even after a Fed rate cutGovernment shutdown delays student loan forgiveness lawsuit — what to knowHow expiring ACA health insurance subsidies could impact Roth conversionsMillions of student loan borrowers at risk of default as late payments climbHow much you can make in 2026 and still pay 0% capital gainsWhat laid off federal workers need to know about their student loansDespite government shutdown, Oct. 15 is still the tax extension deadlineBoomers still love their department stores.

IDR plans set a borrower's monthly bill at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, usually 20 years or 25 years.The Education Department under Trump said that a court order that halted the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan — a Biden administration era program — had implications for other IDR plans.Consumer advocates had argued that that was too broad a reading of the court order. And it left borrowers with just one repayment plan available that led to student loan cancellation: the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. For a period, the Trump administration also paused IBR loan cancellation, though it has since resumed processing that aid.In the agreement with the AFT, the Trump administration also clarified that borrowers who become eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 won't owe federal taxes on the relief. A law that provides tax-free treatment on the federal level for canceled education debt expires at the end of this year.",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samina Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"Correction: Samina Virk is the Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective. An earlier version misspelled her name.",

    "body": "China Shipping containers are seen at the port of Oakland as trade tensions continue over U.S. tariffs with China, in Oakland, California, on May 12, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersBEIJING — China's economy grew 4.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in a year but in line with analyst expectations despite the ongoing real estate slump.Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year as spending on infrastructure and manufacturing slowed. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% growth.Property investment extended its decline, sliding 13.9% in the year through September, compared with a 12.9% drop during the first eight months of the year.The drop in fixed-asset investment is \"rare and alarming,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. He warned that fourth-quarter GDP growth faces downward pressure.The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.\"Weakness in real estate investment may persist for a longer period than previously anticipated,\" Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School, said in Chinese, translated by CNBC.\"This could represent a structural restructuring, and it's possible that investment will never return to its prior levels,\" he said. \"In this context, China needs to consider how to leverage investment from other sectors to fill the investment gap.\"Industrial production climbed 6.5% in September, topping expectations for a 5% increase and up from 5.2% growth in the previous month.Excluding property, fixed-asset investment for the first three quarters of the year rose by 3%, down from 4.2% as of August, according to official data. Private sector investment outside real estate rose 2.1% for the year through September, also slower than the 3% recorded as of August.\"The weakness in investment spending, especially by the private sector, reflects a lack of confidence in the economy's growth prospects as well as in government policies that could support growth,\" Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University, said in an email.Modest consumer spendingRetail sales rose 3% in September from a year ago, matching analyst forecasts. In a sign of waning support from China's consumer goods subsidy program, sales of home appliances rose by a modest 3.3% in September, compared with a surge of 25.3% for the first three quarters of the year.\"I don't think we could stimulate domestic demand without stabilizing the housing market first,\" Dan Wang, Eurasia Group, said Monday ahead of the data release on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"China's Statistics Bureau said disposable income for city residents rose 4.5% in the first three quarters of the year after adjusting for price changes, while rural residents saw a 6% increase.The urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.2% in September from 5.3% the previous month.However, retail sales slowed from 3.4% year-on-year growth in August, while third-quarter GDP slowed from 5.2% growth in the previous quarter.Official data for September also showed continued resilience in China's exports despite tensions with the U.S.The core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy, rose at its fastest pace since February 2024. But headline inflation fell 0.3%, missing expectations as deflationary pressures persisted.Earlier Monday, China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for a sixth-straight month, in line with expectations, with the one-year loan prime rate at 3% and the five-year rate at 3.5%.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's top leaders are meeting from Monday to Thursday to discuss policy and development goals for the next five years.Beijing has sought to shift the economy toward domestic consumption for growth, while developing homegrown technology in the face of rising U.S. restrictions.\"China should step up its efforts in tech, but we also firmly believe the so-called old economy will remain the backbone of the economy for the foreseeable future,\" Nomura Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a note last week. \"Beijing will have to clean up the property sector mess in 2026-30 for several reasons.\"He noted that real estate remains second only to exports in contributing to China's GDP, while about half of household wealth is in property, and that the sector still accounts for about 18% of local government revenue. Overinvestment in new industries such as electric vehicles \"has already become counterproductive,\" Lu said.",

Many now are back online.The outage was first reported at 3:11 a.m. ET in AWS' main US-East-1 region hosted in northern Virginia. A notice on AWS' status page said it was experiencing DNS problems with DynamoDB, its database service that underpins many other AWS applications.DNS, or Domain Name System, translates website names to IP addresses so browsers and other applications can load.AWS cited an \"operational issue\" affecting \"multiple services\" and said it was \"working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery,\" in an update at 5:01 a.m. ET. More than 70 of its own services were affected.Shortly afterward, AWS said it was seeing \"significant signs of recovery.\"AWS said in an update at 6:35 a.m. ET that the DNS issue had been \"fully mitigated\" and that AWS service operations \"are succeeding normally now.\"Around 11 a.m. ET, AWS said it was working to identify the \"root cause\" for the network connectivity issues impacting some of its services.\"We have identified that the issue originated from within the EC2 internal network,\" the company wrote, referring to its popular cloud service that provides virtual server capacity. \"We continue to investigate and identify migrations.\"AWS is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure technology, accounting for around a third of the market, ahead of Microsoft and Google, according to Synergy Research Group.

Through our established incident response arrangements, we are in contact with the company, who are working to restore services as quickly as possible.\"Lloyds Banking Group confirmed that some of its services were affected and asked customers \"to bear with us\" while it worked to restore them. Some 20 minutes later, it added that services were coming back online.The outage also brought down critical tools inside Amazon. Warehouse and delivery employees, along with drivers for Amazon's Flex service, reported on Reddit that internal systems were offline at many sites. Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately.Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage.Reddit, too, is \"working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,\" a spokesperson told CNBC.Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the \"ongoing AWS incident.\" Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.Graphic design tool Canva said it was \"experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.\"Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. \"The root cause is an AWS issue.

In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill.\"There's no sign that this AWS outage was caused by a cyberattack - it looks like a technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,\" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement. \"These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly.\"An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment.Indeed, \"DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,\" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it \"is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.\"\"We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,\" he added.\"This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.\"— CNBC's Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Dario Amodei, Anthropic CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCAnthropic on Monday announced Claude for Life Sciences, a new offering for researchers to use the company's artificial intelligence technology in the advancement of scientific discovery. Claude for Life Sciences is built around Anthropic's existing AI models, but supports new connections with other scientific tools that are commonly used in labs during research and development.It will be able to help researchers through all stages of the discovery process, from carrying out literature reviews to developing hypotheses, analyzing data, drafting regulatory submissions and more, Anthropic said.The launch of Claude for Life Sciences marks Anthropic's first formal entry into the sector, and comes just months after the company hired long-time industry executive Eric Kauderer-Abrams as its head of biology and life sciences. \"Now is the threshold moment for us where we've decided this is a big investment area,\" Kauderer-Abrams told CNBC in an interview. \"We want a meaningful percentage of all of the life science work in the world to run on Claude, in the same way that that happens today with coding.\"Read more CNBC tech news$500 purple cables put this little-known company in the middle of the AI boomNearly half of Kalshi's users saw glitches, delays during Saturday college football gamesSalesforce CEO apologizes for saying Trump should send National Guard to San FranciscoProxy advisor ISS recommends Tesla shareholders oppose Musk's $1 trillion pay planAnthropic, which is one of the companies at the center of the AI boom, develops a family of large language models called Claude. It was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years.The company launched a new model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, late last month and said it is \"significantly better\" at life sciences tasks like understanding laboratory protocols.  Kauderer-Abrams said researchers have already been engaging with Anthropic's models to help with isolated parts of the scientific process, so the company decided to formally build out Claude for Life Sciences as a way to support them from start to finish. That meant Anthropic had to establish integrations with key players in the life sciences ecosystem, including Benchling, PubMed, 10x Genomics and Synapse.org, among others. Anthropic has also partnered with companies that can help life sciences organizations adopt AI, like Caylent, KPMG, Deloitte and cloud providers AWS and Google Cloud, the company said.\"We're willing and enthusiastic about doing that grind to make sure that all the pieces come together,\" Kauderer-Abrams said.In a prerecorded demo, Anthropic showed how a scientist working on preclinical studies could use Claude for Life Sciences to compare two study designs that test different dosing strategies. The scientist was able to query her lab's data directly from Benchling, generate a summary and tables of key differences with links back to the original material. After reviewing the results, the scientist generated a study report that could be included in a regulatory submission. Anthropic said an analysis like this used to require \"days\" of validating and compiling information, but now, it can be done in minutes. Kauderer-Abrams said the company believes AI can bring about real efficiency gains for the life sciences sector, but it's also under \"no illusions\" that it will magically overcome the physical limitations of conducting scientific research. Clinical trials that take three years are not suddenly going to take one month, he said.Instead, Anthropic is focused on exploring the time consuming, expensive parts of the discovery process \"piece by piece\" to determine where AI could be most useful.\"We're here to make sure that this transformation happens and that it's done responsibly,\" Kauderer-Abrams said.WATCH: Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI modelwatch now",

    "body": "Trading cards of the game \"Magic\" are located in a shop where a \"Magic\" tournament is taking place.Frank Rumpenhorst | picture alliance | Getty ImagesAs screentime soars and technology races ahead, a low-tech pastime is back in a big way: collecting trading cards.The cardstock depicting everything from NFL standouts to Pokémon and even Taylor Swift is one of the hottest toy categories in stores this year. Big-box retailers are stocking up ahead of the holidays, anticipating that demand will extend beyond traditional toy buyers like children and collectors.\"We see trading cards being a hot gifting category for all ages that we will fuel with newness and with exclusive drops,\" Rick Gomez, Target's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, told CNBC. \"We're going to have new releases nearly every week during the holidays that's going to drive demand. And these make for great gifts and great stocking stuffers.\"Strategic trading card sales — which exclude sports — are up 103% year-to-date through August, while non-strategic card sales, which tend to be collectible pop culture or sports cards, are up 48%, according to market research firm Circana.Target's trading card sales are up nearly 70% year-to-date, with annual revenue from the category expected to top $1 billion.Sales on some online platforms are rising even faster. Walmart Marketplace reported a 200% jump in trading card sales from February 2024 to June 2025, with Pokémon sales up more than tenfold year-over-year during the same period, the company first told Axios. The retailer has even launched a new weekly influencer livestream series focused on sports collectibles.Since 2021, strategic card sales have grown by $891 million, or 139%, to total $1.5 billion, according to Circana. Sales of non-strategic cards and collectible stickers climbed by $565 million, or 156%, to $925 million in the same period, Circana said.Millennials and Gen Z customers have been crucial for growth, said Juli Lennett, vice president and industry advisor for Circana's U.S. toys practice.\"Lots of adults are buying these because it brings them back to a time when they had no cares in the world,\" Lennett said. \"It's an affordable luxury with the economy right now. Some couldn't afford cards as kids and now they have their own money and no one's there to say 'no'.\"Some buyers also treat cards like alternative investments. Through August, the value of Pokémon cards has delivered a cumulative return of 3,821% since 2004, according to an index by analytics firm Card Ladder, the Wall Street Journal reported. To combat online resellers, many stores now limit purchases to two packs per customer.While the trading card category has boomed this year, not everyone is convinced the segment will boost sales during the peak holiday shopping season. Within the past six months, 19% of adults said they purchased Pokémon cards for themselves, signaling they may not be buying them for others in the weeks ahead, according to Circana.\"There has been steady growth in the category, but a large chunk of buyers are purchasing for themselves. There isn't as much gifting here as you see in other toys,\" Lennett said.Pokemon cards released in 1999Yvonne Hemsey | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesA year-round rushWhat trading cards may lack in holiday flair, they make up for in consistency.Cards stand apart from most toy categories in two key ways: they are frequently self-purchased and not \"super seasonal,\" Lennett said.\"Cards sell just as well in March or July as they do in December,\" she said. \"That makes them very attractive to retailers trying to offset seasonal risk.\"Target, which often gets a bump from merchandise tied to holidays, has tried to capitalize on the year-round fervor for cards.\"We expanded our assortment. We increased the number of drops that we have. We put trading cards in a more prominent place in store, did bolder displays and the business has responded,\" Gomez said. \"We don't see the business slowing and we see it continuing to grow in popularity.\"Pokémon remains the category's top performer, with card sales topping $1 billion last year — it's the first toy brand to hit that milestone in the U.S., according to Circana. Sports cards are also becoming more popular, particularly among teen boys, with NFL packs leading the charge.\"A lot of different people are coming in to buy. You have your adult collector who's buying for themselves, but we also see a lot of families coming in with kids requesting them and asking their parents for trading cards,\" Gomez said. \"It's a great gift for parents, for kids, especially if they know that they're into sports or Pokémon.\"While contemporary releases are booming across people aged eight to 28, vintage cards — typically pre-1970s — haven't connected as strongly with Gen Z and Gen Alpha collectors.\"The majority of my customers aren't looking for vintage,\" Matthew Winkelried, CEO of New York-based Bleecker Trading, told CNBC. \"Younger people don't want to dig through 1960s cards unless they see a Mickey Mantle or Hank Aaron. Plus, the scarcity and price of vintage cards make it a tough entry point.\"Topps trading cards are arranged for a photograph in Richmond, Virginia.Jay Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChanging customersAfter a near-collapse in the 1990s due to overproduction, the trading card industry has rebounded. Growth has been particularly strong since the pandemic, propelled by a blend of nostalgia, community and, for some, investment potential.For many, cards offer a sense of belonging — whether it's exchanging cards or playing a game like Pokémon or Magic: The Gathering.\"You still have the game players, and that's a really tight-knit community,\" said Jason Howarth, senior vice president of marketing and athlete relations at Panini America, which supplies sports cards to retailers like Target and Walmart. \"Among sports fans, there's a huge sense of camaraderie around trading. And with Pokémon too, I've heard game nights still play a major role in keeping that ecosystem alive.\"For those looking to cards as a store of value, Pokémon cards often prove to be a stronger investment than their sports counterparts, said Winkelried of Bleecker Trading.\"Maybe a highly touted rookie joins the league, and you buy their card early hoping it'll rise in value,\" he said. \"The value can change week to week. It's volatile like a stock.\"He added: \"Pokémon is like a commodity. Pikachu can't tear an ACL or get a DUI. Supply is limited, so the market is more stable.\"Looking past the holidays, major retailers are focusing on building the category's long-term future. Target is betting on exclusive sets, limited specialty drops and drawing a more diverse consumer base.\"We are looking at reaching not only breadth of age with trading cards, but also gender,\" Gomez said.That process is already underway. The WNBA is now one of the fastest-growing segments in sports cards, particularly among young girls.And with the 2026 FIFA World Cup spanning the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, soccer is poised to surge next.\"Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese have done wonders for the WNBA trading card business,\" Howarth said. \"Once it hits June, the U.S. marketplace is going to be taken over by soccer. Fans already know the global stars like Messi, but with the World Cup being held here, at least four or five players will skyrocket in popularity and get recognized.\"",

Democrats demand that any stopgap bill include additional spending on health-care protections, including an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are due to expire at year's end.Hassett said on CNBC that he has heard from the Senate that Democrats thought it would be \"bad optics\" to vote to reopen the government before this weekend's massive nationwide \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump.\"Now there's a shot that this week, things will come together, and very quickly,\" Hassett said. \"The moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government, at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

But with numerous polls showing more voters blame Trump and Republicans for the impasse — and indicating strong support for extending the ACA health insurance subsidies — Democrats mostly haven't budged.\"Every day gets better for us,\" Schumer told Punchbowl News earlier this month, \"because we've thought about this long in advance and we knew that health care would be the focal point on Sept. 30 and we prepared for it.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare tax credits in exchange for opening the government.But top Democrats appear to be rejecting Thune's entreaty. Instead, some Democrats are calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.Hassett said Monday that Trump \"has been very active throughout this process, but it's also his position that this is a thing that the Senate needs to work out.\"",

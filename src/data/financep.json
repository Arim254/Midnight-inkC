    "body": "We often underestimate how much our morning rituals can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.\"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement,\" says Mia Soviero, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.\"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen,\" says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit Research Girl, Inc to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.\"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system,\" she says. \"You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to.\"Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routineStep 1: Exposure to sunlightSoviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: Getting adequate sleep sets the tone for the next day, she explains.Then, \"I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning,\" she says. \"Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, especially if you have seasonal depression.\"Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to Harvard Health Publishing.Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day \"can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic,\" the health blog states.Step 2: SudokuSoviero makes time in her mornings to do \"small, meaningful activities\" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.\"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it],\" she says. \"Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great.\"Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine when \"something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens.\"\"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward,\" she says. \"So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine.\"Step 3: Text a friendEach morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. \"I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'\" she says.\"Humans are biologically wired for connections,\" Soviero adds. \"When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing.\" Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Connecting with others is \"really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body,\" Soviero says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "It's the season of giving, the time of year when do-gooders get generous and tax pros occasionally get creative. That's because donations to charities and other types of nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Historically, though, most taxpayers don't receive a tax break for their charitable giving. Other than for a brief period under Covid-19 relief legislation, taxpayers have generally had to itemize to take advantage of the deduction, but about 9 in 10 people take the standard deduction instead, according to the Internal Revenue Service. But the rules around charitable deductions are changing. A provision in President Donald Trump's so-called \"big beautiful\" bill, which passed in July, allows taxpayers who don't itemize to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly for tax year 2026.So, for people thinking about writing a check to their favorite charity, it may make more sense, tax-wise, to wait until January to send it in, says Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder of accounting firm MiklosCPA. \"First and foremost, if they love to give, please give,\" he says. \"But if they are making a strategic move, and they're not going to itemize for sure for 2026 tax year purposes, doing the charitable donation in 2026 does give them a benefit.\"When it makes sense to wait to donateTo be clear, if you plan to give to your favorite charity this holiday season, no one is telling you not to do it. Indeed, many tax pros would advise against upending your financial plans in the name of optimizing your tax return. \"There's certainly a tax calculation, but there's also just the the charitable intent. You potentially need to get money to an organization and you want to do that now,\" says Stephen Eckert, practice leader at Plante Moran's National Tax Office. \"That can override some of this, potentially.\"But if a donation in January would do just as much good as one in December, you may be able to have an equal charitable impact while saving a few bucks, he says.To get the new deduction, you'll have to make a cash donation to a qualifying charitable organization — donations to political campaigns, crowdfunding efforts, private foundations and donor-advised funds are excluded. Make sure to get a receipt for your gift; the IRS generally requires written acknowledgement of any donation in excess of $250.And before making any moves for tax year 2026, you'd be wise to consider whether major life changes on the horizon will drastically change your tax situation, says Ringbauer. The IRS's rules around charitable giving are different and more complicated for those who itemize deductions.\"That's where your trusted financial advisor, your accountant, comes in,\" Ringbauer says. \"Sit down with them before year-end, go through what your scenarios are, and you can come up with a really good solution as to whether [a charitable tax strategy] benefits you or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Performance review season can be nerve-wracking, but there are several ways employees can set themselves up for success.The best thing employees can do for themselves is to practice \"emotional management,\" according to career coach Sarah Baker Andrus.Remaining calm and engaged during the meeting will leave a good impression, she says, while becoming defensive or flustered can reflect poorly on you.Besides, you're likely not the only one feeling nervous, Andrus says. Many managers dread performance review season because \"nobody wants to give somebody negative feedback.\"The way you handle your performance review can \"define your relationship with your supervisor\" going forward, so it's important to get it right, she says.Here are some common performance review mistakes that employees should avoid, according to Andrus.Walking in unpreparedEmployees should come into their performance reviews \"having thought through what contributed to their wins and what contributed to the places where they think they could have done better,\" Andrus says.One blunder that Andrus often sees is that employees will simply copy their self-assessments from the past year, rather than writing a new one.\"That sends a signal that you're not committed to growth and development,\" she says. \"It's a huge mistake.\"Employees should view self-assessments as \"a record of your performance that other people will refer to,\" Andrus says.That's why it's crucial to spend time thoroughly filling out your self-assessment and getting materials like your brag doc ready ahead of the meeting.\"It's not just a piece of paper. Everybody hates doing it, but you've got to take it seriously, or you're not taking yourself seriously,\" she says.Reacting negatively to feedbackIt's a \"huge red flag\" when someone immediately starts arguing with feedback during a performance review, according to Andrus.As an employee, \"the important thing is that you do not react in the moment,\" she says. Andrus acknowledges that receiving negative feedback can be difficult — \"I'm not saying you can't be emotional, we all have emotions,\" she says — but she recommends taking a deep breath before responding.If you don't agree with the criticism, Andrus says she likes using language like, \"That's disappointing,\" she says.Instead of starting an argument, she recommends following up with \"I'm not sure I agree with this — are you willing to continue the conversation later?\"It's okay to disagree, she says, but reacting strongly \"serves nobody\" in the situation and could potentially damage your relationship with your manager.Going off-topicAnother common mistake Andrus sees is that employees will \"bring up issues and problems that deserve their own meeting\" during their performance reviews, such as a conflict with a co-worker or scheduling concerns. In most cases, \"both sides of the table share responsibility\" when this happens, she says: managers should be meeting with their employees frequently enough that they can discuss issues as they arise.\"If we're not meeting regularly, then it's easy for a staff member to want to come in and say, 'Oh my gosh, I finally got on her calendar. Here's my list of other things that I need to talk about'\" during a performance review, Andrus says.Andrus advises employees to focus on the topic at hand. Your performance review meeting is your chance to discuss professional goals and growth opportunities for the next year, \"and there's only so much time,\" she says.That's why it's crucial \"to raise issues as they come up, and not wait for the performance review,\" she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Monday halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the largest project of its kind in the U.S., as well as four other wind farms on the U.S. East Coast.  Shares of Dominion Energy, the utility developing the project, dropped more than 4% on the news. The administration also paused leases for Vineyard Wind 1, Revolution Wind, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind 1. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration paused leases for the projects due to national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176 turbine project project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. Construction began in early 2024 and the project was expected to be complete next year. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, supports the project.The pause will give the federal government time to \"work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects,\" the Interior Department said in a statement. Interior said the U.S. government found that turbine blades and \"highly reflective towers\" create radar interference risk. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

He added he hoped a meeting could take place today or tomorrow.Since starting his second term as president, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. needs the resource-rich Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons. He has refused to rule out the use of force.Meanwhile, Greenland has shown little interest in becoming a top mining nation, and its leaders have criticized the U.S. administration's calls for the country to become a U.S. territory.Late Sunday, Trump posted on social media that he had appointed Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry, as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland.\"Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,\" the president wrote.Read moreThe Danish foreign ministry declined to comment further and referred to Løkke Rasmussen's TV2 interview.In an Instagram post translated by CNBC, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland.\"\"No one should be allowed to change national borders by force. Neither politically nor militarily,\" Frederiksen wrote Monday, adding that she expected respect for the territorial integrity of Denmark.",

    "body": "French cheeses displayed in a store in Paris. Bertrand Guay | Afp | Getty ImagesChina on Monday announced tariffs of up to 42.7% on dairy products from the European Union, following the results of an anti-subsidy investigation that began in August 2024. In a statement by the country's Ministry of Commerce, China said that EU subsidies for dairy products had caused \"substantial damage\" to China's domestic dairy industries. The tariffs are set to take effect on Dec. 23, the ministry said, and the rates would be determined by the amount of \"ad valorem subsidy rates\" from the country's Customs Tariff Commission.The tariffs range from 21.9% to 42.7%, with companies \"who cooperated with the investigation\" subject to tariffs of 28.6%, and those that \"did not cooperate\" facing the top rate of 42.7%, according to a statement from a Commerce Ministry official.Products that will be affected include fresh, processed and blue cheeses — such as the famous Roquefort blue cheese aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France — as well as some kinds of milk and cream. The latest tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions between the regions, which flared up when Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China in October last year.Separately, the bloc in November challenged China's imposition of tariffs on imports of EU brandy at the World Trade Organisation, saying \"China's provisional measures on EU brandy are not in line with WTO rules.\"An EU spokesperson described the measures as \"unjustified and unwarranted\" on Monday, according to Reuters, and said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, would be providing comments to the Chinese authorities.The Commission was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday. Last week, Beijing sharply cut its duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union, with new tariff rates ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exports.It comes after the country in September imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU.— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that China's tariffs will come into force on Dec. 23.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Baidu has announced plans to bring robotaxis to London starting next year through its partnerships with Lyft and Uber, as the UK emerges as a growing autonomous vehicle battleground.The announced collaborations will bring Baidu's Apollo Go autonomous vehicles to the British capital through the Uber and Lyft platforms, the companies said on their respective social media accounts. Lyft's testing of Baidu's initial fleet of dozens of vehicles will begin in 2026, pending regulatory approval, \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there,\" Lyft CEO David Risher said in a post on social media platform X on Monday.Meanwhile, Uber said that its first pilot is expected to start in the first half of 2026. \"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" the company added.The moves add to Baidu's growing global footprint, which it says includes 22 cities and more than 250,000 weekly trips, as it races against other Chinese players like WeRide and Western giants like Alphabet's Waymo. The UK, in particular, has seen a wave of interest from driverless taxi companies, following the government's announcement in June that it would accelerate its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small-scale pilots starting in spring 2026, with Baidu likely aiming to be among the first. The city of London has also established a \"Vision Zero\" goal to eliminate all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation systems by 2041, with autonomous driving technology expected to play a large role. News of Baidu pilots comes as its competitor, Waymo, also looks to begin testing in London, with plans for a full-service launch in 2026. Waymo currently operates, is testing, or has plans to launch in at least 26 markets, including major cities like Tokyo and New York City.Baidu, for its part, has been aggressively expanding globally, with testing rolling out in international markets like the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. ",

    "body": "Sad female worker carrying her belongings while leaving the office after being firedIsbjorn | Istock | Getty ImagesLayoffs have been a defining feature of the job market in 2025, with several major companies announcing thousands of job cuts driven by artificial intelligence. In fact, AI was responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.There were in total 1.17 million job cuts through 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when there were 2.2 million layoffs announced by the end of the year. In October, U.S. employers announced 153,000 job cuts, and there were over 71,000 job cuts in November, with AI being cited for over 6,000 for the month, per Challenger. At a time when inflation bites, tariffs are adding to expenses, and firms are looking to carry out cost-cutting measures, AI has presented an attractive, short-term solution to the problem. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study in November showing that AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market and save as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. Not everyone is convinced that AI is the real reason behind the dramatic job cuts, as Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC, that it might be an excuse. Stephany said many companies that performed well during the pandemic \"significantly overhired\" and the recent layoffs might just be a \"market clearance.\"\"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying 'we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'\" he added.Here are the top firms that cited AI as part of their layoff and restructuring strategy in 2025. Amazon Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesIn October, Amazon announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history, slashing 14,000 corporate roles, as it looks to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes AI. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\"  Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned of the cuts earlier this year, telling employees that AI will shrink the company's workforce and that the tech giant will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\" Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the CES event in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2024. The event typically doubles as a preview of how tech giants and startups will market their wares in the coming year and if early announcements are any indication, AI-branded products will become the new \"smart\" gadgets of 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has cut a total of around 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent announcement in July saw 9,000 roles on the chopping block. CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that the company needed to \"reimagine\" its \"mission for a new era,\" and went on to tout the significance of AI to the company. \"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve,\" Nadella said.

However, unlike other companies that had cited AI in job cuts, Krishna admitted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. In November, the company announced a 1% global cut, which could impact nearly 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike said in May that it's laying off 5% of its workforce or 500 employees, and directly attributed the cuts to AI. \"AI has always been foundational to how we operate,\" co-founder and CEO George Kurtz wrote in a memo included in a securities filing. \"AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.\"Workday Carl Eschenbach, CEO of Workday speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBC In February, HR platform Workday was one of the first companies this year to say its cutting 8.5% of its workforce, amounting to around 1,750 jobs, as the company invests more in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were needed to prioritize AI investment and to free up resources. ",

    "body": "US film producer David Ellison arrives for Paramount's \"Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts\" premiere in New York City on June 5, 2023. Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance on Monday guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison in an amended offer for Warner Bros. Discovery — a clear response to questions raised by the WBD board of directors. \"Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" the company said in a news release. Paramount said Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 per share, all cash, for Warner Bros. Discovery in a hostile attempt that's meant to rival an agreement with Netflix. Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber the board had concerns about the supposed backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in the bid. \"We were not confident that one of the richest people in the world would be there at closing,\" Di Piazza said at the time. \"Doing a deal is great; closing a deal is better.\"WBD earlier this month agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at roughly $83 billion on an enterprise basis. Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, including its portfolio of TV networks, and says its offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion.Paramount notably did not increase its bid on Monday, reiterating that it believes the deal is superior, though Paramount did hike its proposed reverse breakup fee to match that of Netflix's offer. \"What we've done in this amended filing is we've cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer,\" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. watch nowRedBird is an investor in Paramount Skydance and has also committed to financing the proposed Paramount acquisition of WBD. Cardinale said Monday that as part of the amended filing Larry Ellison would back the bid through an irrevocable trust, which is anchored by 1.2 billion Oracle shares. \"Like we've done through the six bids that we've made, we are being responsive to what their concerns are,\" Cardinale said.Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose 3% in early trading Monday, while Paramount gained more than 7%. Netflix's stock was down nearly 1%. Paramount vs. Netflix Paramount made three offers for WBD in the fall, which were all rejected by the company. WBD then launched a formal sale process that brought in offers from other bidders, including Netflix. Cardinale said Paramount's unsolicited offers likely spurred WBD to open up to a sale, putting Paramount \"a little bit on the back foot.\"During Monday's CNBC interview Cardinale, like Ellison on CNBC last week, appealed directly to WBD shareholders. \"At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn't own it. [CEO] David Zaslav doesn't own this company,\" said Cardinale. \"This should be a lot more simple than it is. It's very simple.\"Besides the question of value between the two bids, the question of regulatory approval has also been raised by Paramount as well as industry onlookers. \"The Netflix deal kills competition,\" Cardinale said, adding that a combination of streaming platforms Netflix and HBO Max would create 420 million subscribers under one roof. \"No wonder the constituents in the ecosystem — talent, creators, theatrical exhibitors —  are losing their minds on this because they see the pricing power that they will create.\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have said they are confident their deal would pass regulatory muster. Sarandos has also issued reassurances about the future of the theatrical slate for WBD under Netflix's ownership. At a conference earlier in December, Sarandos argued the Netflix offer for WBD's assets would preserve jobs at a time of mounting layoffs across the industry. ",

New Delhi will also allow duty-free access for dairy and other food ingredients for re-exports.However, to ensure protection to farmers and the domestic industry, New Delhi has said the market access excludes dairy, coffee, milk, cream, cheese, yoghurts, whey, caseins, onions, sugar, spices, edible oils, rubber.India's trade pact with New Zealand \"provides policy certainty and lowers input costs for manufacturing, creating a vision for long-term economic resilience,\" said Ranjeet Mehta, chief executive officer and secretary general, of Indian industry body PHDCCI.Bilateral merchandise trade between the two countries stood at  $1.3 billion in 2024–25 while total trade in goods and services was $2.4 billion in 2024. \"The FTA provides a stable and predictable framework to unlock the full potential of this relationship,\" India's commerce ministry said.The FTA marks India's third deal this year following a free trade agreement with the UK in July and another pact with Oman earlier this month. The deals comes at a time when the U.S., New Delhi's largest trading partner, has levied 50% tariffs on its goods exports, that includes 25% duties for India's purchases of Russian oil.  India, which has ambitions to become an export powerhouse, has been looking to diversify its exports to make up for the impact of U.S. tariffs. After steep tariffs came into force in August, India's exports to the U.S. fell nearly 12% in September and 8.5% in October, before a sharp growth of 22.6% in November.",

    "body": "Ulta is expanding its wellness shop to have more health-focused brands and more shelf space for those items.Melissa Repko | CNBCSanta may be bringing you some supplements this year.Along with typical holiday wish list items like clothing, perfume and gadgets, the wellness category is poised to gain popularity this shopping season and beyond — particularly as retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target give it more shelf space long before the start of New Year's resolutions.Beauty is always a top-performing holiday category. November and December combined account for about 25% of annual spending on prestige beauty items, which includes brands usually sold by specialty beauty retailers and department stores, according to Circana, a market research group. Holiday shoppers said they plan to spend an average of $247 on beauty while buying gifts this year, the fourth-highest holiday category for spending, according to Circana's annual survey.Yet the beauty category's assortment has become wider ranging with the addition of more health and wellness-focused items, such as products that promise to improve nutrition, hydration and sleep.Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana, said wellness has gained attention since the Covid pandemic as consumers prioritize self-care and feeling good from the \"inside out.\" She said health-related products typically relegated to drugstore shelves, such as teeth whitening kits, vitamins, full-body deodorants and eye drops, have gotten a glow-up. Some now come in more attractive packaging, have gotten backing from influencers and celebrities or have moved to the beauty section as retailers seize a chance to blend beauty and wellness and become a one-stop shop.Ulta Beauty, in particular, has carved out more space in its stores for wellness. The specialty retailer, which has more than 1,450 stores across the country, has always carried some individual items related to wellness and \"beauty from within,\" said Laura Beres, the retailer's vice president of wellness.Yet as demand grew after the pandemic, Ulta started to open wellness shops inside of its stores in 2021 and devoted about four to eight feet of shelf space to items including probiotic gummies, sleep masks and aromatherapy oils. In August, the company said it would expand the size of those wellness shops to up to 45 feet in about a third of its stores. It's added nearly 30 new wellness brands to its stores, bringing its total to about 100, Beres said.She said customers who shop wellness cut across ages, but Ulta has seen growth especially with millennial shoppers and consumers with household incomes of more than $100,000. She said innovation has sparked more interest, especially as customers seek solutions for key life stages that brands overlooked in the past, such as needs for pre- and post-pregnancy and menopause.This year, she said Ulta is carrying some gift sets of wellness items, including an Advent calendar of Saje Natural Wellness' essential oils and a beauty sleep gift set from Kourtney Kardashian's vitamins brand, Lemme. Yet she said she expects wellness to become a bigger part of the holidays in the future as the category grows.\"It's the perfect combination of being able to give someone else the gift of relaxation during the holiday season in a really elevated way that just frankly, hasn't existed in the market before,\" she said.Neom Wellbeing is one of the brands carried in Ulta Beauty's wellness shops. The United Kingdom-based brand makes home fragrances and body care items with essential oils intended to reduce stress, improve sleep or boost mood or energy levels.Courtesy of Neom WellbeingOne of the brands in Ulta's wellness shop is Neom Wellbeing, a United Kingdom-based company that sells home fragrances and body-care items. Neom sells online through Amazon and its website, with many top-sellers focused on improving sleep.Amanda Kahn, general manager for the U.S. at Neom, said the company's early sellers this holiday season were stocking stuffers that cost less than $20. As shoppers seek value because of inflation, wellness items are attractive because they're also practical, she said.\"It feels very giftable while also delivering a benefit that everyone can use,\" she said.Shoppers at a Bath & Body Works store at an outlet mall on Black Friday in Sunrise, Florida, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works, best known for its fragranced soaps, candles and lotions, has launched more wellness-focused items, too. Early this month, for instance, it began selling a new wellness fragrance collection called \"Water Winter Mint\" with peppermint and alpine waters scents and ingredients including hyaluronic acid and shea butter.Kristie Lewis, senior vice president of merchandising for the company, said more customers have turned to the mall staple for body-care products or gifts that boost mood and solve health-related challenges, such as dry skin or trouble falling asleep.Bath & Body Works plans to keep expanding its aromatherapy line and its ingredient-led products, she said. It has aromatherapy body products with natural essential oils and launched a holiday collection with the scents eucalyptus pine and vanilla nutmeg.\"We're seeing consumers really buy them for themselves, but also for gifts for holiday because who does not want stress relief or sleep, especially around November and December?\" she said. Nutrition and health has been a trending category at Target, too, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a store tour in the Minneapolis area in October. He said wellness has cut across many of the categories Target sells, such as Joylab, a private brand that's offering bright colors and floral prints of workout gear, Khloe Kardashian's Khloud protein popcorn, and beauty kits and skin masks.He said some of those items are giftable, too. Gomez said he bought his nephew protein powder as a gift.Wellness could gain more square footage at Target next year, he added. It's one of the ideas Target is considering as its deal with Ulta Beauty ends in August and the branded beauty shops inside of hundreds of its stores close, Gomez said. While supplements tend to be more popular around New Year's resolution season, Gruns is hoping its sales get a holiday bump. It's selling some packs of gummies with a holiday flair, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor.Courtesy of GrunsGrüns is one of the wellness items on Target's shelves. The superfood greens gummies are a healthier spin on a fruit snack for adults, but with a nutritional punch similar to a greens powder, said founder and CEO Chad Janis. Its name is inspired by \"grün,\" the word for green in German.Retailers including Walmart, Sprouts Farmers Market and Sam's Club sell the gummies, which have expanded to other lines for kids and for immune support since the company was founded in 2023.While vitamin and supplement sales tend to spike around the new year, Janis said the company hopes its gummies will be a gift or a stocking stuffer. It's selling some holiday-inspired items, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor and a Target pack that's holiday themed.Walmart is carrying some wellness items for the holidays, too, as it sees millennial and Gen Z shoppers seek out self-care and wellness items year-round, such as gift sets of body washes from vitamin maker Olly and vitamin patches from Barrière that look like stickers or temporary tattoos. Even outside of the beauty aisles, retailers have leaned into wellness as a gift-giving category, such as Best Buy, which sells Oura rings and has demos for the health-tracking wearables, and Kohl's, which carries items including massage guns and portable ice baths.During this holiday season, wellness may also get more attention from shoppers who buy items for themselves while shopping for gifts for friends and family, Circana's Jensen said.\"Here's a little ornament with a lip gloss for you and teeth whitening products for me,\" she said. Yet, in the coming years, Jensen said she expects wellness to gain prominence on holiday wish lists because of their high price tags and their wider acceptance. She compared it to anti-aging skin-care products and gift sets. She said they once seemed taboo and now, they're an item that people request.",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The image, which contained two separate photos showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday.  The image showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenza.One of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan, New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up?

The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all Justice Department files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.",

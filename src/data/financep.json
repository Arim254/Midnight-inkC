Louisa Gouliamaki | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has stepped down from his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, CNBC has confirmed.Miran joined the Trump administration's Council of Economic Advisers in January 2025. He had been on leave from this post since September 2025 — when he became a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.Miran was appointed in September to fill the unexpired term of Biden-appointee former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned abruptly in August. At the time, Miran said he expected to fill out Kugler's term, which expired Jan. 31, then return to his CEA post. However, he said then that if his time at the Fed extended beyond that date, he would resign from the CEA. President Donald Trump has not formally nominated a Fed successor yet, though he said last week he would put up former Governor Kevin Warsh to ultimately serve as central bank chair. watch now\"In accordance with the pledge he made to the Senate during his confirmation to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, Stephen Miran has submitted his resignation from the Council of Economic Advisers,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \"Prior to the start of ... Stephen's leave last September, his brilliant insights and powerful advocacy on behalf of the President made him an enormous asset for the White House, and he established himself as a key member of the Trump administration's economic team.\" Since taking the post at the Fed, Miran has argued for aggressive interest rate cuts. He has voted \"no\" at each of the four Federal Open Market Committee meetings he has attended. Central bank policymakers cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-percentage point at three of those meetings; Miran argued for half-point reductions. Most recently, he voted against policymakers' decision to hold rates steady in a range of 3.5% to 3.75% at the January meeting. He wanted to lower rates by a quarter point.In a Friday interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers,\" Miran noted that his seat would be the only vacancy available on the board of governors for Warsh.In a post on social media network X, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that Miran's departure came \"141 days too late.\"Barron's first reported on Miran's plan to leave the CEA. ",

Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will draw down 700 federal law enforcement officers from Minnesota \"effective immediately,\" White House border czar Tom Homan said Wednesday.After that partial withdrawal, around 2,000 federal agents will remain in the state — a roughly 25% reduction — with most concentrated in the Twin Cities area encompassing Minneapolis and St. Paul, Homan said at a press conference in Minneapolis.Homan announced the pullback after touting what he said was \"unprecedented cooperation\" between the federal government and state and local entities. That cooperation boosts efficiency, requiring fewer officers to be sent into communities \"to assume custody of a criminal alien target\" and freeing up resources, Homan said.\"More officers taking custody of criminal aliens directly from the jails, means less officers on the street doing criminal operations,\" he said. \"This is smart law enforcement, not less law enforcement.\"He repeatedly insisted the administration is \"not surrendering\" in Minneapolis, which has become a hotbed of civil unrest over the administration's aggressive deportation tactics. A \"complete drawdown\" in the area will depend on continued cooperation from state and local agencies, as well as \"the decrease of the violence, the rhetoric and the attacks against [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and Border Patrol,\" Homan said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump: If states can't run elections 'honestly,' then 'somebody else should take over'Trump signs bill ending federal government shutdownSen.

But as public opinion rapidly soured on ICE, the administration modulated its tone on the deaths, and President Donald Trump sent Homan to Minnesota manage on-the-ground operations, replacing Gregory Bovino.\"We're not surrendering the president's mission on a mass-deportation operation,\" Homan said Wednesday. \"If you're in the country illegally, if we find you, we'll deport you. But this is about a targeted enforcement operation, and that's what we're going to be doing.\"watch now",

    "body": "Slashwork founders, Jackson Gabbard, Dave Miller, and Josh Watzman.Courtesy: SlashworkTwo years after Meta announced it was shuttering its Workplace enterprise business, a band of former engineers at the social media company is launching a new corporate communication platform.Slashwork, as the startup is called, on Wednesday announced that it has raised $3.5 million in funding from a variety of investors including Slack co-founder Cal Henderson and Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners, the venture capital firm of former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg.The London startup was co-founded by Jackson Gabbard, David Miller and Josh Watzman. The former Facebook engineers said they are designing Slashwork to be an enterprise communication platform similar to Salesforce's Slack and Microsoft Teams but driven by artificial intelligence. \"We've started from there, and then we've said 'What about the 2026 AI era?'\" Gabbard, the CEO, told CNBC. \"What does it look like whenever you start rethinking all of that from the ground up, with AI built into every place that it makes sense?\"Gabbard told CNBC that every piece of content in Slashwork has a large-language model embedding, which allows for robust searches from users. Users can also command AI agents to help them find posts or images that aren't populating.Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer of Meta Platforms Inc., during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFacebook Workplace launched in 2016 as a business communication tool that looked like the company's social network but was designed for enterprise customers to connect their employees. Meta announced it was ending the platform in 2024 to focus efforts on the Metaverse and AI investments.Besides Sandberg, Slashwork received funding from other Facebook veterans, including former revenue chief David Fischer, former ads chief Carolyn Everson and former sales leader AJ Tennant, who was also one of Slack's first sales leaders.Tennant is a key investor for Slashwork. He told CNBC that building AI into its software is a unique advantage for Slashwork. \"Having AI agents that support you in getting your work done, combined with the communication, is going to bridge a lot of gaps that I think exist in enterprise,\" Tennant told CNBC.Julien Codorniou, who led Facebook Workplace from its launch to 11 million paid subscribers, is also a Slashwork board member and has overseen the company's incubation with venture capital firm 20VC.\"The current generation of tools, Slack, Teams, Zoom — which are all 10 years old, pre-AI — were optimized for people talking to people,\" Codorniou said. \"With AI we can also have people talking to systems, and that amplifies the potential for communication.\"Slashwork is launching with smaller tech-focused companies before a wider rollout later this year. Gabbard told CNBC that Slashwork plans to keep the team small, with the money going toward design and product iteration.WATCH: Meta jumps on earnings beat, strong Q1 guidancewatch now",

We saw also in precious metals in the last couple of months, but broadly speaking, clients are holding up to their asset allocations,\" he added.watch nowEyes on the dollar, rates and mid-termsFurther gains in precious metals could be more muted, analysts said.\"While near-term volatility is likely to persist, we view this move as a positioning-driven reset rather than a structural reversal,\" ING's Manthey said.\"Over the coming weeks, the pace and sustainability of any further gains will be shaped by movements in the dollar, interest-rate expectations, and risk sentiment, with precious metals more likely to climb at a steadier pace rather than repeat the explosive rally of the past three months,\" Manthey added.Goldman Sachs has a $5,400 price target on gold by the end of 2026. \"Our forecast incorporates two drivers: that central banks maintain their recent pace of accumulation and that private investors step up gold ETF purchases as the Fed cuts rates,\" Goldman analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven said in a research note.Meanwhile, BofA Securities has an even more bullish $6,000 target for gold in the coming months. \"Fundamentals on the physical market are somewhat shaky but still supportive. That said, we were somewhat concerned about the speed of recent price gains and the rise in volatility accompanying them,\" BofA's global commodities research team said in a note.Clouding their forecast is political uncertainty in the run-up to this year's mid-term elections in November and the direction of U.S. interest rates under President Donald Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve chair, Kevin Warsh.\"While the ultimate impact of a Warsh Fed on precious metals is not entirely clear yet, the correction may not necessarily have been driven by a view on where rates are going – in the end, Warsh seems to be jockeying for further easing – but by optimism that the Fed will be less data-dependent, more forward-looking and pragmatic,\" BofA said.",

In a commentary posted on Tuesday on its WeChat account, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said the \"logically flawed\" and \"utterly ridiculous\" ruling was opposed by the Chinese government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.\"The Panamanian authorities should recognize the situation and correct their course,\" the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said, according to a Google translation. \"If they persist in their own way and remain obstinate, they will inevitably pay a heavy price in terms of politics and economics!\" watch nowIn a brief statement on Jan. 29, Panama's top court said the terms under which Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, runs the port of Balboa on the Pacific Coast and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal violated its constitution. The ruling came around a year after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to seize control of the Panama Canal, saying the waterway was \"vital to our country\" and claiming, \"it's being operated by China.\"'Extensive damages'The comments from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reflect an escalation in tone from China's initial response to the ruling. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that the decision was \"contrary to the laws governing Panama's approval of the relevant franchises, and that the companies will reserve all rights, including legal proceedings.\" Beijing said it would take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. PPC, which has held the contract to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal since the 1990s, also said that the decision was inconsistent with the relevant legal framework.

In a statement, the company said PPC would seek \"extensive damages\" over the ruling, without specifying the damages sought.Shares of CK Hutchison closed up over 2% on Wednesday.

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $77.62 billion, according to LSEG. Lilly also projects adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year. That compares with analysts' estimate of $33.23 per share, according to LSEG. The guidance comes in stark contrast to the outlook of rival Novo Nordisk, which is also grappling with lower prices in the U.S. following landmark deals both companies struck with President Donald Trump to slash obesity and diabetes drug costs. Unlike Lilly, Novo warned on Tuesday that it sees sales and profit declining as much as 13% this year, as prices fall in the U.S. and exclusivity expires for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs in China, Brazil and Canada. Meanwhile, the midpoint of Lilly's revenue guidance sees sales growing by 25% this year. The strong outlook comes days after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told CNBC in an exclusive interview that he expects upcoming government Medicare coverage of obesity treatments to expand the U.S. market for those drugs this year, saying it's a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool\" of patients. In an earnings presentation Wednesday, Lilly cited several factors that it will benefit from this year, including Medicare coverage, continued worldwide demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound, and the expected launch of its GLP-1 pill for obesity in the second quarter, pending U.S. approval. But Lilly said it will be hit by a global pricing decline by a low- to mid-teens percentage, driven by the deal with Trump, new direct-to-consumer rates for Zepbound and lower Medicaid pricing on some older products, among other factors. Lilly is working to maintain its dominance in the booming market for those drugs, called GLP-1s, as Novo sees an explosive U.S. launch for its new Wegovy pill for obesity. Ahead of that rollout in January, Lilly's share of the U.S. obesity and diabetes drug market increased to 60.5% in the fourth quarter, up 2.6% from the previous quarter, according to the presentation. Novo's market share in the fourth quarter was 39.1%.Mounjaro raked in $7.41 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 110% from the same period a year ago. U.S. sales for Mounjaro were $4.1 billion, rising 57%, as demand climbed but realized prices were lower. Those numbers surpassed what analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.Zepbound, which entered the market roughly three years ago, posted $4.2 billion in U.S. revenue for the fourth quarter. That's up 122% from the year-earlier period, as demand for the drug also rose while realized prices dropped. Analysts were expecting $3.91 billion in U.S. sales for Zepbound, according to StreetAccount.Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $7.54 adjusted vs. $6.67 expectedRevenue: $19.29 billion vs. $17.96 billion expectedEli Lilly shares climbed more than 7% in premarket trading.The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $19.29 billion, up 43% from the same period a year ago. Revenue in the U.S. climbed to $12.9 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 50% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of those drugs, the company said.The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsNovo and Lilly's deals with Trump are expected to eventually increase the number of prescriptions but ultimately hurt total sales.Under the agreements, Lilly and Novo will slash the prices of those treatments for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, which has yet to launch. In return, both companies will also get a three-year exemption from tariffs. In the interview with CNBC on Friday, Lilly's Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. But he said volume growth of the company's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.\"",

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, during a Bloomberg Television interview in San Francisco, Dec. 9, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Wednesday said its artificial intelligence chatbot Claude will remain ad-free, a decision that comes just weeks after the startup's rival OpenAI announced plans to begin testing advertisements within ChatGPT. In a blog post, Anthropic said that Claude users will not see ads or sponsored links near their conversations, and the chatbot's answers will not be influenced by third-party product placements. The personal nature of users' conversations with Claude would make ads feel \"incongruous\" and \"in many cases, inappropriate,\" the company said.Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers, including its CEO, Dario Amodei. The company is best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude, and its AI coding tool Claude Code has exploded in popularity in recent months.\"Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users,\" Anthropic said in the blog post. \"This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\"Read more CNBC tech news'Muskonomy' shakeup: SpaceX valuation approaches Tesla's after merger with xAIPinterest CEO rebukes, fires 'obstructionist' employees who created tool to track layoffsNvidia, OpenAI appear stalled on their mega deal. But the AI giants still need each otherNvidia's Jensen Huang denies OpenAI deal rumors: 'There's no drama'Last month, OpenAI said it would start to test ads with its free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. The company said the ads will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses. OpenAI inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, so introducing ads to ChatGPT could help the company meet those ambitious spending commitments. Digital advertising has long been the primary revenue driver for other big tech companies like Google and Meta.By forgoing ads within Claude, Anthropic could miss out on a lucrative revenue stream, but the company is not being shy about its decision. Anthropic unveiled its first Super Bowl campaign on Wednesday, which centers around the company's decision to keep Claude ad-free. Anthropic will air a 60-second pregame ad and a 30-second in-game ad that both feature the tag line, \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\"WATCH: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on AI race: Focused on making our models as smart and capable as possiblewatch now",

    "body": "Workers of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA operating pumpjack in Lake Maracaibo, in Cabimas, Venezuela, Jan. 27, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersThe Trump administration could issue a general license as soon as this week for companies to produce oil and gas in Venezuela, a person familiar with the plan told CNBC on Tuesday.Chevron is the only U.S. company currently allowed to pump oil in Venezuela under a special license issued by the Treasury Department. Chevron has several joint ventures with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.President Donald Trump is pressuring the oil industry to invest at least $100 billion to repair Venezuela's energy industry after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Jan. 3. \"The President's team is working around the clock to ensure oil companies are able to make investments in Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Stay tuned,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement. Bloomberg first reported the news. Last week, the Treasury Department issued a general license that allowed U.S. companies to buy, sell, transport and refine Venezuelan crude oil, among other activities. But that license did not include upstream production. Companies were previously barred from these activities under U.S. sanctions. The Venezuelan government last week also passed reforms to ease state control of its oil industry and give more autonomy to private companies. The oil industry's response to investing in Venezuela has been mixed. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump at the White House on Jan. 9 that the country needs big reforms and is \"uninvestable\" under its current system. Exxon has had its assets seized twice by the government in Caracas. Private wildcatters and smaller shale oil companies have shown more enthusiasm about the potential opportunity in the South American nation. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told CNBC last week that it can ramp up production in Venezuela by 50% in the next 18 to 24 months with approvals from the U.S. It currently produces about 250,000 barrels per day in the South American nation. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and is believed to have the largest crude oil reserves in the world. ",

    "body": "A customer enters a Taco Bell restaurant in El Cerrito, California, US, on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Wednesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite strong demand for Taco Bell.Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.73 adjusted vs. $1.77 expectedRevenue: $2.51 billion vs. $2.45 billion expectedYum reported fourth-quarter net income of $535 million, or $1.91 per share, up from $423 million, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. The company's tax rate was higher than anticipated by Wall Street, according to Kalinowski Equity Research.Excluding tax benefits, acquisition costs and other one-time items, the restaurant company earned $1.73 per share.Net revenue rose 6% to $2.51 billion.Yum's global same-store sales increased 3%, fueled by strong performance at Taco Bell and in KFC's international markets. Taco Bell's same-store sales spiked 7% in the quarter, topping Wall Street expectations of 5.6% growth, according to StreetAccount. The Mexican-inspired chain is the gem of Yum's portfolio, regularly outperforming the broader fast-food industry, thanks to a mix of value offerings and buzzy menu items. The chain is stealing market share from competitors, and consumers aged 18 to 24 years old are flocking to its restaurants, Yum CEO Chris Turner said on the company's conference call.KFC saw its global same-store sales rise 3%. The fried chicken chain's international locations reported same-store sales growth of 3%, while restaurants in the U.S. saw a same-store sales increase of 1%. Wall Street analysts had expected KFC to report same-store sales growth of 2.1%, according to StreetAccount. KFC has been undergoing a turnaround in its home market, where it has ceded market share to upstarts like Raising Cane's in recent years. To win back customers, it is taking some cues from Taco Bell's successful playbook. The chain is planning to unveil new menu items, like sauces and beverages, at a more rapid pace than it previously did. The chain will also try to offer customers more affordable options, whether it is a \"profitable low-price point products\" or targeted individual value offers, executives said on the company's conference call.And once again, Pizza Hut was the laggard of the portfolio. The embattled pizza chain reported that its same-store sales declined 1%, driven by a 3% drop in the U.S. and slightly edging out Wall Street estimates of a 1.7% decline during the period. In November, the company said it would explore strategic options for Pizza Hut. Yum on Wednesday said that the review had begun but did not share more details.\"As of now, we intend to complete the review of options this year,\" Turner said. \"Given the ongoing nature of the process at this time, we cannot share further details on the strategic review.\"While Pizza Hut undergoes the review, Yum is also implementing a strategy that will act as a \"bridge to a longer-term acceleration of the brand,\" according to CFO Ranjith Roy. As part of that plan, Pizza Hut will shutter about 250 underperforming U.S. locations in the first half of the year.",

    "body": "watch nowPinterest CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved. \"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions,\" Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. \"But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist.\" Pinterest announced on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go. Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a \"critical moment\" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're \"working against the direction of the company\" and disagree with its mission, he said. Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.\"I know people have natural curiosity around these things,\" Ready said. \"We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level.\" A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.\"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy.\"Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders Meta and Google. Investors have raised concerns around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for shopping, \"which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025. \"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us,\" Ready said. \"We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus.\"More recently, Pinterest's advertising sales slowed as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.  Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. Amazon last week said it would lay off about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October. Meta cut about 10% of staff in its Reality Labs unit, while design software maker Autodesk slashed about 7% of its workforce.WATCH: Pinterest CEO Bill Ready learned one key business lesson earlywatch now",

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Getty ImagesThe harsh winter storm that recently hit much of the country took its toll on the mortgage market in the week that followed. Potential buyers stayed home, and mortgage rates didn't move enough to spark refinance demand.Total mortgage application volume dropped 8.9% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Last week's results included an adjustment for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.21% from 6.24%, with points increasing to 0.56 from 0.55, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Despite the drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 5% for the week but were still 117% higher than the same week one year ago, when rates were over 7%. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 57.1% of total applications from 56.2% the previous week.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 14% for the week and were just 4% higher year over year.\"Winter Storm Fern likely had an impact as much of the country was snowed in, hampering homebuying activity,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. \"The annual increase in purchase applications was the weakest since April 2025.\"Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, on a separate index from Mortgage News Daily. They are now at the highest level in two weeks, but that's not saying much, as the range is tiny. Rates rose as the result of a stronger-than-expected report on the manufacturing sector.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the time reference for the recent winter storm.",

We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places ... the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Trump said in that interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump: If states can't run elections 'honestly,' then 'somebody else should take over'Trump signs bill ending federal government shutdownSen.

Trump has urged congressional Republicans to pass that bill.States are primarily responsible for governing their own election systems under the U.S. Constitution. When asked about that fact on Tuesday, Trump replied, \"They can administer the election, but they have to do it honestly.\"He also said, \"If you think about it, a state is an agent for the federal government in elections. I don't know why the federal government doesn't do them anyway. But when you see some of these states about, how horribly they run their elections, what a disgrace it is.\"Trump echoed his frequent claim that elections in the 2020 cycle — when he lost his reelection bid to former President Joe Biden — were \"rigged\" and \"crooked.\" There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 elections.\"Take a look at Detroit,\" he said. \"Take a look at Philadelphia. You go take a look at Atlanta.\"\"Look at some of the places that — horrible corruption on elections, and the federal government should not allow that.

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. labor market barely budged in January, with hiring below even muted expectations, according to a report Wednesday from payrolls processing firm ADP.Private companies added just 22,000 positions for the month and the number would have been negative had it not been for a surge of 74,000 hires in the education and health services category. The total was less than the downwardly revised 37,000 increase in December and below the Dow Jones consensus forecast for 45,000.The report starts 2026 off on basically the same note where 2025 ended: A lackluster job market in a low-hire, low-fire environment that likely will do little to quell fears from Federal Reserve policymakers that more support may be needed.\"Hiring is softening. It continues a pattern that we've noticed for the past three years,\" Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, said on CNBC. \"Employers are very reticent to hire in the current economy.\"Richardson noted that benchmark revisions the firm employed to its data showed that job gains in 2025 already were weaker than reported, by about 18,000 per month, or 216,000 for the year.Outside of the health care-related jobs, the primary driver behind employment growth last year, financial activities added 14,000 positions while construction rose by 9,000 and both the trade, transportation and utilities and the leisure and hospitality industries contributed 4,000.However, several sectors reported losses.Professional and business services tumbled 57,000, the other services category lost 13,000 and manufacturing was down 8,000. All but 1,000 net jobs came from the services sector.From a size standpoint, companies employing between 50 and 499 workers added all the jobs, with small firms flat and large employers down 18,000. The totals don't add up exactly because of rounding.Wage gains were little changed from December, with those staying in their jobs seeing growth of 4.5%.The ADP report typically precedes the more closely watched Bureau of Labor Statistics nonfarm payrolls report, which normally would be out Friday. However, the just-ended partial government shutdown has caused a delay in the BLS release. ",

    "body": "watch nowChipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, although traffic to its restaurants fell for the fourth straight quarter.For 2026, the company is projecting flat same-store sales growth, signaling that the burrito chain's woes are not expected to disappear quickly. Chipotle ended a bumpy 2025 with a full-year same-store sales decline of 1.7%, marking the first annual decline since 2016.However, executives said the outlook is \"conservative,\" citing unpredictable consumer trends. Last year, the company cut its full-year forecast for same-store sales three times as dining habits shifted from quarter to quarter.Shares of the company fell as much as 11% in extended trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 25 cents adjusted vs. 24 cents expectedRevenue: $2.98 billion vs. $2.96 billion expectedThe fast-casual chain reported fourth-quarter net income of $330.9 million, or 25 cents per share, down from $331.8 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding impairment costs, gains from terminating restaurant leases and other items, Chipotle earned 25 cents per share.Net sales rose 4.9% to $2.98 billion.The company's same-store sales fell 2.5% for the quarter, making this reporting period the third quarter of the year with same-store sales declines. However, Wall Street was anticipating a steeper same-store sales decrease of 3%, according to StreetAccount estimates.Traffic to Chipotle restaurants fell by 3.2%. Executives have previously said they have seen a pullback in spending from consumers of all income cohorts, although low-income diners have made the most significant shift to their behavior.Over the past year, shares of Chipotle have lost roughly a third of their value, dragging the company's market value down to about $51 billion, as of Tuesday's close. Investor enthusiasm for the stock waned after the fast-casual chain began reporting shrinking traffic to its restaurants.To bring back customers, Chipotle is focusing on improving the chain's operations and adding new menu items, rather than leaning into discounts. In December, at the tail end of the quarter, the company unveiled \"protein cups,\" with the goal of convincing protein-obsessed customers to stop by for a snack, not just lunch or dinner.\"I think having a taco at $3.50 and a protein cup around $3.80 across the country is really an approachable price point that really gives the consumer a meaningful way into the brand, but also solves for those people that are looking for a different choice, whether they're GLP-1 users or looking for other dietary restrictions, more high protein or high fiber,\" CEO Scott Boatwright said on a conference call with analysts.Chipotle is trying to raise menu prices at a slower pace than inflation in the hopes of attracting price-conscious consumers. However, the company also has a strong base of high-income customers.\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in income and average household income,\" Boatwright said, adding that the chain plans to target those customers more this year.Chipotle opened 132 company-owned locations and seven restaurants run by international licensees during the quarter. That brought its total to 334 company-owned locations and 11 international partner restaurants opened for the year. In 2026, the company is projecting that it will open 350 to 370 new restaurants, including 10 to 15 international locations that will be run by licensees.",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks, alongside Sen. Ron Wyden, to press in the Capitol, Feb. 3, 2025.Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesSens. Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden and Richard Blumenthal called on federal agencies to scrutinize AI deals from Nvidia, Meta and Google for potential antitrust violations, in a letter shared with CNBC. The three Democrats addressed the letter on Wednesday to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, urging the agencies to review recent deals in which tech companies have paid to pluck specific employees from startups without acquiring the companies entirely. The senators characterized the deals as \"reverse acqui-hiring.\"These deals \"function as de facto mergers, allowing the companies to consolidate talent, information, and resources, all while apparently attempting to bypass the scrutiny typically applied to mergers and acquisitions,\" the letter reads. The senators wrote that the FTC and DOJ should \"carefully scrutinize these deals and block or reverse them should they violate antitrust law.\" The pressure by the senators could make it more difficult for tech companies to continue pursuing these types of deals. Venture capitalists and experts have previously told CNBC that these deals often leave some investors and employees in a state of limbo while founders and AI leaders get paid handsomely. The senators said these kinds of deals ultimately benefit big tech companies while impeding competition.In the letter, the senators specifically mention Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI in June to bring in CEO Alexandr Wang to lead the social media company's AI strategy. The letter also references Google's $2.4 billion nonexclusive licensing agreement in July with Windsurf, which brought the search company key leaders from the AI coding startup. The most recent deal included in the letter was Nvidia's $20 billion December deal to buy assets from AI chipmaker Groq and bring in senior leaders. \"These arrangements further consolidate the Big Tech industry, which in turn could cause higher prices and stifle innovation,\" the senators wrote in the letter addressed to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater and FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. \"The FTC and DOJ should not allow these companies to avoid the typical reviews that your agencies apply to acquisitions and mergers.\"The letter follows a statement from Ferguson in January in which he said the FTC would review these kinds of deals to learn whether tech companies are attempting to evade regulatory reviews.WATCH: Nvidia-OpenAI megadeal news is not good for OpenAI.watch now",

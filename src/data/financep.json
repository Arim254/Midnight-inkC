    "body": "It's the season of giving, the time of year when do-gooders get generous and tax pros occasionally get creative. That's because donations to charities and other types of nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Historically, though, most taxpayers don't receive a tax break for their charitable giving. Other than for a brief period under Covid-19 relief legislation, taxpayers have generally had to itemize to take advantage of the deduction, but about 9 in 10 people take the standard deduction instead, according to the Internal Revenue Service. But the rules around charitable deductions are changing. A provision in President Donald Trump's so-called \"big beautiful\" bill, which passed in July, allows taxpayers who don't itemize to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly for tax year 2026.So, for people thinking about writing a check to their favorite charity, it may make more sense, tax-wise, to wait until January to send it in, says Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder of accounting firm MiklosCPA. \"First and foremost, if they love to give, please give,\" he says. \"But if they are making a strategic move, and they're not going to itemize for sure for 2026 tax year purposes, doing the charitable donation in 2026 does give them a benefit.\"When it makes sense to wait to donateTo be clear, if you plan to give to your favorite charity this holiday season, no one is telling you not to do it. Indeed, many tax pros would advise against upending your financial plans in the name of optimizing your tax return. \"There's certainly a tax calculation, but there's also just the the charitable intent. You potentially need to get money to an organization and you want to do that now,\" says Stephen Eckert, practice leader at Plante Moran's National Tax Office. \"That can override some of this, potentially.\"But if a donation in January would do just as much good as one in December, you may be able to have an equal charitable impact while saving a few bucks, he says.To get the new deduction, you'll have to make a cash donation to a qualifying charitable organization — donations to political campaigns, crowdfunding efforts, private foundations and donor-advised funds are excluded. Make sure to get a receipt for your gift; the IRS generally requires written acknowledgement of any donation in excess of $250.And before making any moves for tax year 2026, you'd be wise to consider whether major life changes on the horizon will drastically change your tax situation, says Ringbauer. The IRS's rules around charitable giving are different and more complicated for those who itemize deductions.\"That's where your trusted financial advisor, your accountant, comes in,\" Ringbauer says. \"Sit down with them before year-end, go through what your scenarios are, and you can come up with a really good solution as to whether [a charitable tax strategy] benefits you or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Monday he will summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark for a conversation about President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland.\"I'm deeply upset about the appointment and the statement, which I find completely unacceptable,\" Løkke Rasmussen told Danish media TV2 in an interview Monday morning. He added he hoped a meeting could take place today or tomorrow.Since starting his second term as president, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. needs the resource-rich Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons. He has refused to rule out the use of force.Meanwhile, Greenland has shown little interest in becoming a top mining nation, and its leaders have criticized the U.S. administration's calls for the country to become a U.S. territory.Late Sunday, Trump posted on social media that he had appointed Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry, as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland.\"Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,\" the president wrote.Read moreThe Danish foreign ministry declined to comment further and referred to Løkke Rasmussen's TV2 interview.In an Instagram post translated by CNBC, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland.\"\"No one should be allowed to change national borders by force. Neither politically nor militarily,\" Frederiksen wrote Monday, adding that she expected respect for the territorial integrity of Denmark.",

    "body": "Performance review season can be nerve-wracking, but there are several ways employees can set themselves up for success.The best thing employees can do for themselves is to practice \"emotional management,\" according to career coach Sarah Baker Andrus.Remaining calm and engaged during the meeting will leave a good impression, she says, while becoming defensive or flustered can reflect poorly on you.Besides, you're likely not the only one feeling nervous, Andrus says. Many managers dread performance review season because \"nobody wants to give somebody negative feedback.\"The way you handle your performance review can \"define your relationship with your supervisor\" going forward, so it's important to get it right, she says.Here are some common performance review mistakes that employees should avoid, according to Andrus.Walking in unpreparedEmployees should come into their performance reviews \"having thought through what contributed to their wins and what contributed to the places where they think they could have done better,\" Andrus says.One blunder that Andrus often sees is that employees will simply copy their self-assessments from the past year, rather than writing a new one.\"That sends a signal that you're not committed to growth and development,\" she says. \"It's a huge mistake.\"Employees should view self-assessments as \"a record of your performance that other people will refer to,\" Andrus says.That's why it's crucial to spend time thoroughly filling out your self-assessment and getting materials like your brag doc ready ahead of the meeting.\"It's not just a piece of paper. Everybody hates doing it, but you've got to take it seriously, or you're not taking yourself seriously,\" she says.Reacting negatively to feedbackIt's a \"huge red flag\" when someone immediately starts arguing with feedback during a performance review, according to Andrus.As an employee, \"the important thing is that you do not react in the moment,\" she says. Andrus acknowledges that receiving negative feedback can be difficult — \"I'm not saying you can't be emotional, we all have emotions,\" she says — but she recommends taking a deep breath before responding.If you don't agree with the criticism, Andrus says she likes using language like, \"That's disappointing,\" she says.Instead of starting an argument, she recommends following up with \"I'm not sure I agree with this — are you willing to continue the conversation later?\"It's okay to disagree, she says, but reacting strongly \"serves nobody\" in the situation and could potentially damage your relationship with your manager.Going off-topicAnother common mistake Andrus sees is that employees will \"bring up issues and problems that deserve their own meeting\" during their performance reviews, such as a conflict with a co-worker or scheduling concerns. In most cases, \"both sides of the table share responsibility\" when this happens, she says: managers should be meeting with their employees frequently enough that they can discuss issues as they arise.\"If we're not meeting regularly, then it's easy for a staff member to want to come in and say, 'Oh my gosh, I finally got on her calendar. Here's my list of other things that I need to talk about'\" during a performance review, Andrus says.Andrus advises employees to focus on the topic at hand. Your performance review meeting is your chance to discuss professional goals and growth opportunities for the next year, \"and there's only so much time,\" she says.That's why it's crucial \"to raise issues as they come up, and not wait for the performance review,\" she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "US film producer David Ellison arrives for Paramount's \"Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts\" premiere in New York City on June 5, 2023. Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance on Monday guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison in an amended offer for Warner Bros. Discovery — a clear response to questions raised by the WBD board of directors. \"Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" the company said in a news release. Paramount said Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. The guarantee does not replace committed funds from RedBird Capital and sovereign wealth funds, but constitutes a new layer of security for the commitments. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 per share, all cash, for Warner Bros. Discovery in a hostile attempt that's meant to rival an agreement with Netflix. Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber the board had concerns about the supposed backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in the bid. \"We were not confident that one of the richest people in the world would be there at closing,\" Di Piazza said at the time. \"Doing a deal is great; closing a deal is better.\"WBD earlier this month agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at roughly $83 billion on an enterprise basis. Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, including its portfolio of TV networks, and says its offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion.Paramount notably did not increase its bid on Monday, reiterating that it believes the deal is superior, though Paramount did hike its proposed reverse breakup fee to match that of Netflix's offer. \"What we've done in this amended filing is we've cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer,\" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. watch nowRedBird is an investor in Paramount Skydance and has also committed to financing the proposed Paramount acquisition of WBD. Cardinale said Monday that as part of the amended filing Larry Ellison would back the bid through an irrevocable trust, which is anchored by 1.2 billion Oracle shares. \"Like we've done through the six bids that we've made, we are being responsive to what their concerns are,\" Cardinale said.Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose 3% in early trading Monday, while Paramount gained more than 7%. Netflix's stock was down nearly 1%. Paramount vs. Netflix Paramount made three offers for WBD in the fall, which were all rejected by the company. WBD then launched a formal sale process that brought in offers from other bidders, including Netflix. Cardinale said Paramount's unsolicited offers likely spurred WBD to open up to a sale, putting Paramount \"a little bit on the back foot.\"During Monday's CNBC interview Cardinale, like Ellison on CNBC last week, appealed directly to WBD shareholders. \"At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn't own it. [CEO] David Zaslav doesn't own this company,\" said Cardinale. \"This should be a lot more simple than it is. It's very simple.\"Besides the question of value between the two bids, the question of regulatory approval has also been raised by Paramount as well as industry onlookers. \"The Netflix deal kills competition,\" Cardinale said, adding that a combination of streaming platforms Netflix and HBO Max would create 420 million subscribers under one roof. \"No wonder the constituents in the ecosystem — talent, creators, theatrical exhibitors —  are losing their minds on this because they see the pricing power that they will create.\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have said they are confident their deal would pass regulatory muster. Sarandos has also issued reassurances about the future of the theatrical slate for WBD under Netflix's ownership. At a conference earlier in December, Sarandos argued the Netflix offer for WBD's assets would preserve jobs at a time of mounting layoffs across the industry. ",

    "body": "We often underestimate how much our morning rituals can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.\"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement,\" says Mia Soviero, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.\"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen,\" says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit Research Girl, Inc to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.\"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system,\" she says. \"You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to.\"Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routineStep 1: Exposure to sunlightSoviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: Getting adequate sleep sets the tone for the next day, she explains.Then, \"I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning,\" she says. \"Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, especially if you have seasonal depression.\"Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to Harvard Health Publishing.Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day \"can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic,\" the health blog states.Step 2: SudokuSoviero makes time in her mornings to do \"small, meaningful activities\" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.\"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it],\" she says. \"Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great.\"Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine when \"something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens.\"\"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward,\" she says. \"So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine.\"Step 3: Text a friendEach morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. \"I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'\" she says.\"Humans are biologically wired for connections,\" Soviero adds. \"When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing.\" Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Connecting with others is \"really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body,\" Soviero says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "French cheeses displayed in a store in Paris. Bertrand Guay | Afp | Getty ImagesChina on Monday announced tariffs of up to 42.7% on dairy products from the European Union, following the results of an anti-subsidy investigation that began in August 2024. In a statement by the country's Ministry of Commerce, China said that EU subsidies for dairy products had caused \"substantial damage\" to China's domestic dairy industries. The tariffs are set to take effect on Dec. 23, the ministry said, and the rates would be determined by the amount of \"ad valorem subsidy rates\" from the country's Customs Tariff Commission.The tariffs range from 21.9% to 42.7%, with companies \"who cooperated with the investigation\" subject to tariffs of 28.6%, and those that \"did not cooperate\" facing the top rate of 42.7%, according to a statement from a Commerce Ministry official.Products that will be affected include fresh, processed and blue cheeses — such as the famous Roquefort blue cheese aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France — as well as some kinds of milk and cream. The latest tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions between the regions, which flared up when Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China in October last year.Separately, the bloc in November challenged China's imposition of tariffs on imports of EU brandy at the World Trade Organisation, saying \"China's provisional measures on EU brandy are not in line with WTO rules.\"An EU spokesperson described the measures as \"unjustified and unwarranted\" on Monday, according to Reuters, and said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, would be providing comments to the Chinese authorities.The Commission was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday. Last week, Beijing sharply cut its duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union, with new tariff rates ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exports.It comes after the country in September imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU.— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that China's tariffs will come into force on Dec. 23.

    "body": "After 45 drawings with no jackpot winner, the Powerball jackpot has climbed to $1.6 billion ahead of Monday night's drawing at 10:59 p.m. ET.The jackpot ranks as the fourth largest in Powerball history and the fifth largest among U.S. lottery jackpots, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association, which runs the lottery.To win the jackpot, a ticketholder must match all six numbers on their ticket. The winner would then choose between an annuitized prize estimated at $1.6 billion or a lump-sum payment estimated at $735.3 million. The annuity option includes one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.Both options are before taxes. Winnings are subject to an automatic 24% federal withholding, but winners can expect to be in the top 37% marginal tax bracket when they file their 2025 return.State taxes can reduce winnings even further. Eight states — California, Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming — do not tax lottery winnings at all, while most others levy state taxes of roughly 4% to 6%.Below is a state-by-state breakdown of how much winners could take home under both payout options, listed alphabetically by each state and district, per usamega.com. ArizonaLump sum: $444,899,480Annuity: $969,289,380ArkansasLump sum: $434,605,280Annuity: $946,889,400CaliforniaLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400ColoradoLump sum: $430,928,780Annuity: $938,889,390ConnecticutLump sum: $411,884,510Annuity: $897,449,400DelawareLump sum: $414,752,180Annuity: $903,689,400FloridaLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400GeorgiaLump sum: $425,119,910Annuity: $926,249,400IdahoLump sum: $421,406,645Annuity: $918,169,380IllinoisLump sum: $426,884,630Annuity: $930,089,400IndianaLump sum: $441,222,980Annuity: $961,289,400IowaLump sum: $435,340,580Annuity: $948,489,390KansasLump sum: $421,369,880Annuity: $918,089,400KentuckyLump sum: $433,869,980Annuity: $945,289,380LouisianaLump sum: $441,222,980Annuity: $961,289,400MaineLump sum: $410,708,030Annuity: $894,889,380MarylandLump sum: $393,428,480 Annuity: $857,289,390MassachusettsLump sum: $397,104,980Annuity: $865,289,400MichiganLump sum: $432,031,730Annuity: $941,289,390MinnesotaLump sum: $390,854,930Annuity: $851,689,380MississippiLump sum: $430,928,780Annuity: $938,889,390MissouriLump sum: $428,722,880Annuity: $934,089,390 MontanaLump sum: $419,899,280 Annuity: $914,889,390NebraskaLump sum: $425,046,380Annuity: $926,089,380New HampshireLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400New JerseyLump sum: $384,237,230Annuity: $837,289,380New MexicoLump sum: $419,899,280Annuity: $914,889,390New YorkLump sum: $383,134,280Annuity: $834,889,380North CarolinaLump sum: $432,031,730Annuity: $941,289,390North DakotaLump sum: $441,958,280Annuity: $962,889,390OhioLump sum: $440,303,855Annuity: $959,289,390OklahomaLump sum: $428,355,230Annuity: $933,289,380OregonLump sum: $390,487,280Annuity: $850,889,400PennsylvaniaLump sum: $440,708,270Annuity: $960,169,380Rhode IslandLump sum: $419,237,510 Annuity: $913,449,390South CarolinaLump sum: $417,693,380Annuity: $910,089,390South DakotaLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400TennesseeLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400TexasLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400VermontLump sum: $398,943,230Annuity: $869,289,390VirginiaLump sum: $421,002,230Annuity: $917,289,390WashingtonLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400Washington, D.C.Lump sum: $384,237,230Annuity: $837,289,380West VirginiaLump sum: $427,840,520Annuity: $932,169,390WisconsinLump sum: $407,031,530Annuity: $886,889,400WyomingLump sum: $463,281,980Annuity: $1,009,289,400Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldAlphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday between 6 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.The power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.\"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections,\" Waymo's Philion also told CNBC. \"This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting from San Francisco.",

    "body": "Ted Sarandos, left, co-CEO of Netflix, and David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.Mario Anzuoni | Mike Blake | ReutersHours before Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, called WBD CEO David Zaslav to inform him Netflix wouldn't be bidding any higher. WBD shareholders now have a chance to call Sarandos' bluff.WBD shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash, though that deadline may be artificial. Paramount can extend it all the way to WBD's annual meeting, which hasn't been set yet but this year took place June 2. If Paramount acquires 51% of outstanding WBD shares, it would control the company, even though the WBD board already agreed to sell the company's studio and streaming assets to Netflix. Both Netflix and Paramount can use the coming days and weeks to speak with WBD shareholders to gauge whether they'd like to take Paramount's offer or stick with the board's recommendation to sell to Netflix. To tender or not to tender, that is the question. There are sound arguments for both sides. The decision also presents a game theory element for shareholders who may simply want a bidding war rather than caring about the right buyer.To tenderThere are two overarching reasons why a shareholder might tender their holdings to Paramount. The first is if the investor believes Paramount's $30-per-share, all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for just the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. The second is a belief that tendering shares is the best way to force a bidding war between Netflix and Paramount.A shareholder could decide Paramount's current offer is better than Netflix's if they think it has a higher likelihood of regulatory approval or if they believe Discovery Global — the portfolio of linear cable networks including CNN, TNT, Discovery, HGTV and TBS that's set to be spun out — will have minimal value as a publicly traded company. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC earlier this month he values Discovery Global at $1 per share, given his prediction on the likely multiple (two times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at which it will trade based on current valuations for similar linear cable networks. If WBD doesn't agree to sell the entire company to Paramount, it plans to split Discovery Global out as its own publicly traded entity in mid-2026. Paramount's argument is that $30 per share is already greater than Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer plus $1 per share for Discovery Global. David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance, exits following an interview at the New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 8, 2025.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersParamount's bid is also all cash, while Netflix's bid includes 16% equity with a so-called collar, which means shareholders won't know exactly how much Netflix stock they'll actually receive until the deal closes. As for regulatory approval, Paramount has played up arguments that a combined Netflix and HBO Max streaming business would be anticompetitive. Netflix has more than 300 million global paying customers. The idea of the largest streamer buying HBO Max has already raised concerns with politicians, including President Donald Trump, who said there may be a \"market share\" issue with a Netflix deal. While Paramount would combine Paramount+ with HBO Max, Paramount+ has about 80 million subscribers, presenting less of a risk to competition. The second, more nuanced argument to tender is to maximize upside even if the assets ultimately go to Netflix. Ellison has already made it known Paramount's $30-per-share offer isn't best and final. Tendering could cause Netflix to come back with a higher offer, which may then prompt Paramount to raise its bid as well. GAMCO Investors chairman and CEO Mario Gabelli told CNBC earlier this month \"the notion of Company A and Company B having a bidding war — that's what we like as part of the free market system.\" He added last week that while he was previously leaning toward tendering his shares to Paramount, \"the most important part is to keep it in play.\" Not to tenderOther shareholders may believe, in contrast, that not tendering is the best way of jumpstarting a bidding war. If Paramount sees that it's not getting traction with shareholders as the annual meeting gets closer, it may raise its bid to get more shareholders on board. There are additional reasons not to tender. Shareholders may want the Netflix and Discovery Global equity portion of the Netflix proposal. In a WBD filing last week, the company said a mystery \"Company C\" proposed to acquire Discovery Global and its 20% stake in WBD's streaming and studios business for $25 billion in cash. That bid was rejected by the WBD board as \"not actionable.\" Still, the mystery bid suggests there may be an interested buyer in all of Discovery Global if it gets spun out, which could result in far more than $1 per share, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. That's a good reason not to tender, he said, because it makes the Netflix offer much more valuable than Paramount's bid. Ensuring WBD splits Discovery Global is also the safe play for shareholders in case regulators block a Paramount-WBD merger, Greenfield said. Since the Paramount deal is for all of WBD, including CNN, Ellison's bid — which includes roughly $24 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign funds — may run into regulatory and political hurdles, Greenfield noted.\"You want the split to happen,\" Greenfield said in an interview. \"If the Paramount deal doesn't get regulatory approval, now you've prevented the split from happening. You're stuck in 2027 with declining cable networks, and you haven't spun them off. Does the U.S. really want a company funded by more Middle Eastern money than money from the Ellisons owning CNN?\" 'Where's Poppa?'WBD's board has argued part its reasoning for rejecting Paramount's $30-per-share bid was its concern with financing, noting more funding comes from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds than the Ellison family, which has committed about $12 billion. Paramount altered the terms of its deal Monday to help address funding concerns. Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the father of David and one of the world's five wealthiest people, agreed to provide \"an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" should the existing financing fall through, Paramount said in a statement. Paramount also said Monday it will publish records confirming the Ellison family trust \"owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that all material liabilities of the Ellison family trust are publicly disclosed.\" Paramount has said the family trust will backstop the financing. WBD's board had previously argued the trust is an \"opaque entity,\" preferring a direct commitment from the Ellisons. Notably, even with the Monday announcement, the Ellisons haven't increased their personal equity investment, which still stands at $12 billion. Internally, some WBD executives have cited the 1970 Carl Reiner movie \"Where's Poppa?\" when speaking about the bid, according to a person familiar with the matter. WBD has pushed for the Ellisons to commit more personal money to the deal. Still, a WBD shareholder may not care where the funding is coming from as long as it's there. The three SWFs involved in the deal are the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Co. and the Qatar Investment Authority. The PIF and QIA, in particular, are known institutions that have contributed billions of dollars to other U.S.-based deals.Correction: This story has been revised to correct that Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash. A previous version misstated this deadline.",

    "body": "Formula 1 cars and a circuit made with Lego are displayed at the 2025 Canadian International AutoShow at the Metro Convention Centre in Toronto, Feb. 21, 2025.Nurphoto | Getty ImagesLego is rebuilding how consumers engage with motorsport brick by brick.In 2025, Lego kicked off a partnership with Formula 1 that brought officially licensed sets to global retail shelves and immersive experiences to races around the world. In the nearly year since launch, the collaboration has bolstered fan engagement for both brands, lead to promotional sales of Lego products and expanded the demographic reach for the toy company and the racing organization.In August, Lego CEO Niels Christiansen touted the company's Formula 1 sets as one of the innovations that fueled record first-half revenue and operating profit. The company, which is privately held, reported a 12% year-over-year revenue bump to 34.6 billion Danish kroner, or $5.4 billion, for the first six months of 2025.\"It is a massively growing fan base,\" Julia Goldin, chief product and marketing officer at Lego, told CNBC. \"It is the biggest motorsport now in terms of its fandom. ... We felt that we could really tap into that and deliver something very unique.\"With Formula 1, Lego isn't just leveraging an existing fandom, it's expanding it, bringing underserved demographics into the world of racing and engaging new customers. \"Lego has a great reputation for picking out the right trends to become a part of, and motorsports in recent years has been on a real upswing,\" said James Zahn, editor in chief of The Toy Book.\"F1, as we've seen, has just become a cultural juggernaut where it is attracting an audience that isn't your typical motorsports fan,\" he said. \"It seems to transcend ages and interests.\"ESPN, which broadcast the 2025 F1 season in the U.S., reported record viewership numbers for the races. The Disney-owned sports network saw an average of 1.3 million viewers across its stations and platforms through the majority of the racing calendar. That was up from a previous record of 1.21 million viewers set in 2022 and up from just 554,000 in 2018, the first year of ESPN's broadcasting deal with F1.Next year, U.S. broadcasting rights move to Apple TV following the success of the Apple-distributed \"F1: The Movie,\" which hit cinemas in June.F1 Academy Lego car model during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas on Nov. 19, 2025 in Las Vegas.Hector Vivas | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesIn expanding its catalog of products — introducing meticulously designed F1 car brick sets, complete with team-accurate liveries — Lego has built gateways into the brand for newcomers. \"At the heart of it was understanding our audience's passion points,\" Goldin said. \"When we choose to go into a partnership, could we see ourselves doing something unique that would offer real value ... we felt like we had a real opportunity to deliver experiences that they would really love.\"The F1 portfolio included products for Lego's Duplo line for preschool children, traditional sets for casual builders and Lego Technic sets for more advanced builders.

Building a new future\"Lego is one of our dream partners,\" said Susie Wolff, managing director of F1 Academy, an all-female racing league under the broader F1 umbrella. \"When they joined Formula 1, I immediately reached out to Julia [Goldin], the [chief product and marketing officer], and said, 'Listen, could we explore doing something together with F1 Academy?'\" Wolff told CNBC. \"There's just so many synergies between what they're trying to do and what our main mission is.\"F1 Academy held its inaugural season in 2023. The division was established to address the lack of female drives in the F1 series and aims to develop young female drivers and prepare them for higher levels of competition.\"We're trying to break down the preconceptions of motorsport being a male-dominated environment,\" Wolff said, noting Lego has similarly made strides to promote inclusivity with its brick sets.As part of the ongoing relationship between the two brands, Lego has signed on as a team sponsor for an F1 Academy car starting in 2026. Behind the wheel is Esmee Kosterman, a 20-year-old Dutch driver.F1 Academy Lego livery reveal during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas at Las Vegas Strip Circuit in Las Vegas, Nov. 19, 2025.Hector Vivas | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesLego's Goldin said while the F1 Academy partnership is an extension of the existing racing partnership, \"they're doing it in a unique way, because they are actually partnering up to support a life-size car and the driver.\" \"That's a very important element of bringing more attention and kind of underscoring the credibility and authenticity of women participating in motorsports and, importantly, for their parents to see the opportunity [and] potential for them to be engaged in the sport,\" Goldin said. Zahn of The Toy Book described the collaboration between Lego and Formula 1, particularly the F1 Academy, as a \"perfect partnership.\"\"[The] Female motorsports fan has always been there, but they haven't necessarily been embraced on the consumer product side of things,\" he said.Wolff and Goldin both noted that one of the fastest-growing segments of the Formula 1 fan base is women. \"We are tapping exactly into the the trend of this fandom and we're adding value to the partner, as well,\" Goldin said. \"We see from our data that not only are we engaging more F1 fans with the Lego brand, but vice versa. There are more Lego brand fans that are now becoming fans of Formula 1.\"",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The photo, which contained two separate images showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday. The photo showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenzaOne of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche early Sunday said the image was removed from the website after learning there were concerns about women in the photo, \"so we pulled that photo down.\"\"It has nothing to do with President Trump,\" said Blanche on NBC's \"Meet the Press.The disappearance of the image and more than a dozen other files over the weekend came despite a law signed by Trump that required the agency to make public all of the Epstein files by Friday.The image went live on the DOJ's website on Friday, and disappeared from the webpage several hours later. The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all Justice Department files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.CNBC has reached out to the DOJ over Massie's remarks. ",

    "body": "Ulta is expanding its wellness shop to have more health-focused brands and more shelf space for those items.Melissa Repko | CNBCSanta may be bringing you some supplements this year.Along with typical holiday wish list items like clothing, perfume and gadgets, the wellness category is poised to gain popularity this shopping season and beyond — particularly as retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target give it more shelf space long before the start of New Year's resolutions.Beauty is always a top-performing holiday category. November and December combined account for about 25% of annual spending on prestige beauty items, which includes brands usually sold by specialty beauty retailers and department stores, according to Circana, a market research group. Holiday shoppers said they plan to spend an average of $247 on beauty while buying gifts this year, the fourth-highest holiday category for spending, according to Circana's annual survey.Yet the beauty category's assortment has become wider ranging with the addition of more health and wellness-focused items, such as products that promise to improve nutrition, hydration and sleep.Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana, said wellness has gained attention since the Covid pandemic as consumers prioritize self-care and feeling good from the \"inside out.\" She said health-related products typically relegated to drugstore shelves, such as teeth whitening kits, vitamins, full-body deodorants and eye drops, have gotten a glow-up. Some now come in more attractive packaging, have gotten backing from influencers and celebrities or have moved to the beauty section as retailers seize a chance to blend beauty and wellness and become a one-stop shop.Ulta Beauty, in particular, has carved out more space in its stores for wellness. The specialty retailer, which has more than 1,450 stores across the country, has always carried some individual items related to wellness and \"beauty from within,\" said Laura Beres, the retailer's vice president of wellness.Yet as demand grew after the pandemic, Ulta started to open wellness shops inside of its stores in 2021 and devoted about four to eight feet of shelf space to items including probiotic gummies, sleep masks and aromatherapy oils. In August, the company said it would expand the size of those wellness shops to up to 45 feet in about a third of its stores. It's added nearly 30 new wellness brands to its stores, bringing its total to about 100, Beres said.She said customers who shop wellness cut across ages, but Ulta has seen growth especially with millennial shoppers and consumers with household incomes of more than $100,000. She said innovation has sparked more interest, especially as customers seek solutions for key life stages that brands overlooked in the past, such as needs for pre- and post-pregnancy and menopause.This year, she said Ulta is carrying some gift sets of wellness items, including an Advent calendar of Saje Natural Wellness' essential oils and a beauty sleep gift set from Kourtney Kardashian's vitamins brand, Lemme. Yet she said she expects wellness to become a bigger part of the holidays in the future as the category grows.\"It's the perfect combination of being able to give someone else the gift of relaxation during the holiday season in a really elevated way that just frankly, hasn't existed in the market before,\" she said.Neom Wellbeing is one of the brands carried in Ulta Beauty's wellness shops. The United Kingdom-based brand makes home fragrances and body care items with essential oils intended to reduce stress, improve sleep or boost mood or energy levels.Courtesy of Neom WellbeingOne of the brands in Ulta's wellness shop is Neom Wellbeing, a United Kingdom-based company that sells home fragrances and body-care items. Neom sells online through Amazon and its website, with many top-sellers focused on improving sleep.Amanda Kahn, general manager for the U.S. at Neom, said the company's early sellers this holiday season were stocking stuffers that cost less than $20. As shoppers seek value because of inflation, wellness items are attractive because they're also practical, she said.\"It feels very giftable while also delivering a benefit that everyone can use,\" she said.Shoppers at a Bath & Body Works store at an outlet mall on Black Friday in Sunrise, Florida, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works, best known for its fragranced soaps, candles and lotions, has launched more wellness-focused items, too. Early this month, for instance, it began selling a new wellness fragrance collection called \"Water Winter Mint\" with peppermint and alpine waters scents and ingredients including hyaluronic acid and shea butter.Kristie Lewis, senior vice president of merchandising for the company, said more customers have turned to the mall staple for body-care products or gifts that boost mood and solve health-related challenges, such as dry skin or trouble falling asleep.Bath & Body Works plans to keep expanding its aromatherapy line and its ingredient-led products, she said. It has aromatherapy body products with natural essential oils and launched a holiday collection with the scents eucalyptus pine and vanilla nutmeg.\"We're seeing consumers really buy them for themselves, but also for gifts for holiday because who does not want stress relief or sleep, especially around November and December?\" she said. Nutrition and health has been a trending category at Target, too, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a store tour in the Minneapolis area in October. He said wellness has cut across many of the categories Target sells, such as Joylab, a private brand that's offering bright colors and floral prints of workout gear, Khloe Kardashian's Khloud protein popcorn, and beauty kits and skin masks.He said some of those items are giftable, too. Gomez said he bought his nephew protein powder as a gift.Wellness could gain more square footage at Target next year, he added. It's one of the ideas Target is considering as its deal with Ulta Beauty ends in August and the branded beauty shops inside of hundreds of its stores close, Gomez said. While supplements tend to be more popular around New Year's resolution season, Gruns is hoping its sales get a holiday bump. It's selling some packs of gummies with a holiday flair, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor.Courtesy of GrunsGrüns is one of the wellness items on Target's shelves. The superfood greens gummies are a healthier spin on a fruit snack for adults, but with a nutritional punch similar to a greens powder, said founder and CEO Chad Janis. Its name is inspired by \"grün,\" the word for green in German.Retailers including Walmart, Sprouts Farmers Market and Sam's Club sell the gummies, which have expanded to other lines for kids and for immune support since the company was founded in 2023.While vitamin and supplement sales tend to spike around the new year, Janis said the company hopes its gummies will be a gift or a stocking stuffer. It's selling some holiday-inspired items, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor and a Target pack that's holiday themed.Walmart is carrying some wellness items for the holidays, too, as it sees millennial and Gen Z shoppers seek out self-care and wellness items year-round, such as gift sets of body washes from vitamin maker Olly and vitamin patches from Barrière that look like stickers or temporary tattoos. Even outside of the beauty aisles, retailers have leaned into wellness as a gift-giving category, such as Best Buy, which sells Oura rings and has demos for the health-tracking wearables, and Kohl's, which carries items including massage guns and portable ice baths.During this holiday season, wellness may also get more attention from shoppers who buy items for themselves while shopping for gifts for friends and family, Circana's Jensen said.\"Here's a little ornament with a lip gloss for you and teeth whitening products for me,\" she said. Yet, in the coming years, Jensen said she expects wellness to gain prominence on holiday wish lists because of their high price tags and their wider acceptance. She compared it to anti-aging skin-care products and gift sets. She said they once seemed taboo and now, they're an item that people request.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

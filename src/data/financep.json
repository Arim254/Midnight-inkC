    "body": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford hold a press conference at the U.S. Department of Transportation Headquarters on Nov. 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday afternoon that he will be reducing flight capacity by 10% at 40 major airports starting on Friday morning, affecting roughly 3,500 to 4,000 flights daily.It was not immediately clear which airports would be affected.\"This is proactive,\" Duffy said in a news conference.Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said additional measures could be taken after the initial reduction.\"As we slice the data more granularly, we are seeing pressures build in a way that we don't feel, if we allow it to go unchecked, will allow us to continue to tell the public that we operate the safest airline system in the world,\" Bedford said on Wednesday.Bedford added that the administration will be meeting with the airline community to decide how to move forward on implementing the reduction, which he said has never happened before during his time in the industry.The government shutdown, which entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, is now the longest in U.S. history.Duffy said he expects more cancellations as a result of the reduction, which has no set end time. \"We thought 10% was the right number based on the pressure we were seeing,\" Duffy added.The move comes as air traffic controllers have missed their paychecks due to the government shutdown. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are among the essential government employees who are required to work during the shutdown.The closure has also raised concerns about already thin staffing among air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Insufficient staffing at some FAA facilities has disrupted some flights since Oct. 1.Earlier this week, Duffy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he could \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown drags on.On Wednesday morning, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that it could take \"weeks to recover\" from the impacts of the government shutdown on air traffic controllers.",

    "body": "Dr. Sidrah Nisar was both excited and overwhelmed to land a $125,000 salary right out of veterinary school in 2019.\"I had more money than I could handle,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Little did she know, she would soon be more than doubling that annual income by switching from full-time positions to contract work as a relief vet. Nisar's sister, who's also a vet, introduced her to an app called Roo that connects vets to clinics in need of coverage. Nisar started picking up shifts through Roo in May 2023 and left her full-time job in September of that year.\"I love being a relief veterinarian because I get to meet new people, talk to new people, learn new things every time I go into a new hospital,\" she says.In her full-time positions, Nisar worked 40 to 50 hours a week. Now, she works 50 to 60 hours a week, but on a schedule she can dictate, and with higher hourly rates. In 2024, Nisar earned $366,000 from shifts she picked up on Roo. She earned an additional $18,000 as a brand ambassador for Roo, plus another $2,000 from vet shifts she picked up outside of Roo to bring her total income for the year up to $386,000.Vets on Roo earn nearly twice as much per hour as the average full-time vet, and on average make $1,266 per day, the company says. Working full-time hours at that rate would easily help vets make more than the median $125,510 a year veterinarians nationwide earn, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Still, contract positions like the relief vet work Nisar does aren't for everyone. Here are three of the main differences to consider.1. Pay consistencyWhile a full-time position may come with rigid time-off policies or daily schedules, it also comes with a regular paycheck. Losing that guaranteed pay is \"the one setback of being a relief veterinarian,\" Nisar says.\"With being a relief vet, you kind of always have to be hustling and looking for work.\"Nisar credits the Roo app with making it easier to find shifts that work for her, but acknowledges the possibility that there could be a time when she struggles to find enough shifts to meet her financial obligations. For now, Roo has a lot of hospitals available in Nisar's area, \"so that's never a significant worry of mine,\" she says. 2. Work-life balanceWhen she worked full-time in animal hospitals, Nisar says she was \"consistently just thinking about my job when I wasn't at work.\"That quickly changed when she switched to relief work. Since she works at a number of different hospitals and may not return to some, Nisar is better able to separate what's happening at work from her personal life.\"My work-life balance has definitely changed since becoming a relief veterinarian,\" she says. \"I definitely am able to leave work at work and I don't bring it home with me versus being a full time vet.\"Like any workplace, drama and interpersonal conflicts can arise at animal hospitals where employees see each other every day and develop close relationships, for better or worse. As a relief vet, Nisar is largely able to stay out of any issues that can come up, or can choose not to return to hospitals where she doesn't enjoy working with the staff. \"[It's] significantly less stress,\" she says. \"When you're doing relief [shifts] you go in, you do your work, and then you leave.\"3. Mentorship opportunitiesWhile Nisar is happier doing relief work than she was in full-time positions, she doesn't recommend it for veterinarians just getting out of school because they still have a lot to learn that likely won't come as easily if they're bouncing from clinic to clinic.\"Doing that full time job and learning from your mentor is very, very important,\" she says. \"My advice to new vets is to do your full-time job first and having a mentor there and then stepping into relief [work] if that's something that you feel that would suit you best.\"And for experienced vets, Nisar says relief work still isn't right for everyone and you \"have to have a certain personality\" to be successful. \"You are going into a brand new clinic most of the time and you're meeting new people,\" she says. \"You have to be patient. You have to be flexible because you're doing what they want you to do. You're there to help them.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Supreme Court justices on Wednesday expressed skepticism about the legality of aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump against most of the world's nations.Conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's method for enacting the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax.Lower federal courts ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority he cited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico.Sauer, who is defending the tariff policy as grounded in the power to regulate foreign commerce, said \"these are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue-raising tariffs.\"\"The fact that they raise revenue was only incidental,\" Sauer said, shortly after oral arguments in the case began.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's three liberal members, told Sauer, \"You say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are.\"\"They're generating money from American citizens, revenue,\" Sotomayor said.She later noted that no president other than Trump has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs since it became law in 1977.Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of six conservatives on the court, pressed Sauer on the fact that Trump unilaterally imposed the tariffs by citing purported international emergencies of trade imbalances and the flow of fentanyl into the United States, without Congress authorizing them.\"What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to take these powers back?\" Gorsuch asked.\"So Congress as a practical matter can't get this power back once it's handed it over to the president,\" Gorsuch said. \"It's a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people's elected representatives.\"Other conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito — also pressed Sauer.The tariffs start at a baseline of 10% on many nations and spike to as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil.The tariffs, if allowed to stand, would result in $3 trillion in extra revenue for the United States by 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.That group last week said the federal government collected $151 billion from customs duties in the second half of fiscal year 2025, \"a nearly 300% increase over the same period in\" fiscal year 2024.Rick Woldenberg, CEO of educational toy company Learning Resources, which is involved in a case against U.S. President Donald Trump, stands outside the U.S. Supreme Court, as its justices are set to hear oral arguments on Trump's bid to preserve sweeping tariffs after lower courts ruled that he overstepped his authority, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 5, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersNeal Katyal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, opened his argument by saying, \"Tariffs are taxes,\" picking up the theme that multiple justices had raised with Sauer.\"Our founders gave that taxing power to Congress alone.\"\"We don't think IEEPA allows this junking of the worldwide tariff architecture,\" Katyal later said.When Roberts asked him if tariffs implicated the power of the president to conduct foreign policy for the United States, as Sauer had argued, Katyal replied, \"We agree that tariffs have foreign policy implications.\"But he added that the Founding Fathers had delegated the power to tax to Congress in the Constitution.Katyal also pointed out that despite the argument that the reciprocal tariffs are being used to address trade deficits, Trump imposed a tariff of 39% on imports from Switzerland, an ally of the U.S., even though the U.S. runs a trade surplus with that nation.No other president has ever done something like that, he said.The Supreme Court, which heard more than 2½ hours of arguments, will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday.It is not clear when the court will release its ruling, but the Trump administration has asked for the decision to be expedited.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in a court filing in September, said the U.S. might have to refund $750 billion or more if the Supreme Court ruled the tariffs are illegal and if it waited until next summer to issue that ruling.Bessent attended Wednesday's hearing.In a post on X later, Bessent wrote, that Sauer, the solictor general, \"presented strong, persuasive arguments on the necessity of using IEEPA tariff authority to confront the emergencies President Trump has declared.\"\"More importantly, the plaintiffs' attorneys, Neal Katyal and Benjamin Gutman, espoused arguments that reflected foundational misunderstandings and misrepresentations about the Trump Administration's trade goals,\" Bessent said.\"Showing their dramatic lack of economic understanding, Messrs. Katyal and Gutman argued that a President does have the authority to impose an embargo or quotas on other countries because those actions do not affect government revenues,\" Bessent wrote. \"Of course, they do. What embarrassing statements to make in front of SCOTUS.\"The case is seen as a key legal test for Trump, who has won some favorable rulings from the Supreme Court for other policies during his second term in the White House.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn a statement after the hearing, Victor Owen Schwartz, whose company V.O.S. Selections is one of the plaintiffs challenging the tariffs, said: \"For nearly 40 years, my family has built this business from the ground up. Today, reckless tariffs threaten everything we've achieved.\"\"Let's be clear: these tariffs aren't paid by foreign governments or companies,\" said Schwartz, whose company imports wines and spirits. \"It's American businesses like mine, and American consumers, that are footing the bill for the billions of dollars collected monthly by our government.\"\"Unlike past tariffs set by Congress that we could plan around, these new tariffs are arbitrary,\" he said. \"They're unpredictable. And they're bad business.\"Trump insists the tariffs are crucial to protecting the American economy and citizens. He says they serve as a sharp prod to companies to make their products in the United States.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, \"Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country.\"\"With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security,\" Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.\"Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,\" he said.\"A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.\"Critics of tariffs say their financial hit is borne not by foreign manufacturers but by U.S. importers who pay them and then largely pass on the added costs to American consumers.Trump previously said he was considering attending the oral arguments, which would have been an apparent first for a sitting president.On Sunday, he said on Truth SociaI, \"I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.\"It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 4, 2022. Mike Blake | ReutersDigital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion.The fundraise comes after a slew of acquisitions and as the company expands its product base beyond just payments.Crypto and digital asset companies are trying to take advantage of what is seen by the industry as a more favorable environment in the U.S. after the election of President Donald Trump and the passing of a landmark stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act.Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace.'Record year of growth'\"The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products,\" Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its \"record year of growth.\"Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company.\"We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future\" Long said.Ripple has looked to position itself as a fintech firm bringing crypto and digital assets technology to institutional clients.When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly.Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions.Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail.Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management.Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas.\"We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things,\" Long said.While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now.\"We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature,\" Long said.\"We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. We will continue to remain private.\"Ripple's funding comes as cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. This week, bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, with billions of dollars being wiped off the overall market.",

    "body": "Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Lucid Group missed Wall Street's expectations for a second consecutive quarter as the all-electric vehicle maker continues to address problems with the launch of its new flagship Gravity SUV.The company, for a second consecutive quarter, also cut the high end of its annual production guidance to around 18,000 vehicles from a previous forecast of between 18,000 and 20,000 units. Its original target for this year was 20,000 units. It also reduced the low end target of its capital expenditures by $100 million to between $1 billion and $1.2 billion.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $2.65 adjusted vs. a loss of $2.27 expectedRevenue: $336.6 million vs. $379.1 million expectedLucid reported a net loss for the quarter of $978.4 million, or $3.31 per share, compared with a net loss of $992.5 million, or $4.09 per share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items including restructuring, the company lost $2.65 a share.The company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was a loss of $717.7 million vs. an expected loss of $597.4 million, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. That loss widened year-over-over by 17%. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier. Its quarterly revenue increased roughly 68% from $200 million a year earlier.In addition to releasing its third-quarter results, Lucid said it has agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, the company's largest shareholder.The company reported total liquidity of $5.5 billion to end the quarter, including the undrawn credit line. Its cash and cash equivalents were roughly flat from the end of last year at $1.6 billion, with a total financial runway into the first half of 2027, the company said.Lucid also said it continues to evaluate finance and liquidity options outside of the PIF as it launches its Gravity SUV and develops an upcoming midsize vehicle, which isn't expected to start production until at least late next year.An autonomous robotaxi from Uber's partnership with Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro.Courtesy: Nick Twork | LucidRegarding Gravity, Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said the company \"remains intensely focused on ramping up production and addressing the significant supply chain disruptions impacting the entire industry.\"During the company's last quarterly results in August, Winterhoff admitted there were problems with Gravity, saying the company planned to significantly increase production during the second half of the year.Winterhoff told investors Wednesday that the company continues to believe it can achieve a significant increase in Gravity deliveries during the fourth quarter, despite the supply chain issues and an industrywide slowdown in EV demand. Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said Gravity production increased quarter-to-quarter but remains at an unmeaningful level.The earnings results come roughly a month after Lucid reported third-quarter vehicle deliveries of 4,078 units, which increased from a year earlier but also fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations.Lucid has made several partnership announcements this year. In July, it signed a $300 million deal with Uber that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs over the next six years that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro. More recently, it announced an expanded partnership with Nvidia for autonomous vehicle technologies.Lucid's results are in stark contrast to fellow pure EV company Rivian Automotive, which on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and drove the stock price up during intraday trading Wednesday.Shares of Rivian — following near-record gains Wednesday — are up roughly 16% in 2025, while Lucid remains off more than 40%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split this summer.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc., arrives at the Tesla plant in Gruenheide, Germany, on March 13, 2024.Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla sold just 750 electric vehicles in Germany for October 2025, less than half of what it sold a year ago, according to data out Wednesday from the country's federal transport authority, known as KBA.In October last year, Tesla sold 1,607 EVs in Germany.KBA data shows 434,627 new battery electric vehicles year to date, the KBA data said, up nearly 40% from the same period last year. Of those EVs, 15,595 were Teslas, a decline of 50% for Elon Musk's automaker this year.Tesla operates a massive vehicle assembly plant in Brandenburg, Germany, which is outside of Berlin, but the company is not a hometown favorite.Musk's incendiary political rhetoric and endorsement of AfD, Germany's extremist, anti-immigrant party, have weighed on left-leaning consumers' interest in the Tesla brand there.Read more CNBC tech newsAmazon upheaval: With morale shaken, Jassy looks for next big play after mass layoffsArmis raises $435 million, valuing cybersecurity startup at $6.1 billionChinese EV maker Xpeng to launch robotaxis, humanoid robots with self-developed AI chipsTrump renominates Musk ally Jared Isaacman to run NASA months after withdrawalTesla also faces a passel of European and Chinese competitors throughout Europe offering smaller and more affordable EVs, many priced below 35,000 euros.During October, Tesla began selling a new, lower-cost version of its Model Y SUV in Germany. The stripped-down version of the SUV was priced at 39,990 euros for the German market -- about 5,000 euros lower than the cheapest, previously available versions of the Model Y there.It remains to be seen whether Tesla's new, lower-priced model variants can help revitalize demand for their EVs in Germany or Europe.Policy changes ahead may lift EV sales in Germany, overall.Germany scrapped incentives to boost purchases of fully electric vehicles about two years ago, a policy change that led to a sharp drop in demand for fully electric vehicles, initially. The country is now poised to start up a new EV incentive program that goes into effect in January 2026, and is intended to help lower- and middle-income buyers adopt zero tailpipe emission vehicles.",

    "body": "e.l.f. Beauty welcomes rhode to its family at the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, Sept. 5, 2025.Diane Bondareff | Invision for e.l.f. Beauty | APHailey Bieber's cosmetics line Rhode is expected to increase E.l.f. Beauty's annual sales by $200 million this fiscal year, but its new parent company's full-year guidance still fell below expectations, leading its stock to plunge 29% Wednesday.E.l.f., which declined to release full-year guidance last quarter, is expecting full-year revenue to be between $1.55 billion and $1.57 billion, implying 18% to 20% sales growth. That's far below the $1.65 billion analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tarang Amin said Rhode, which the company acquired earlier this year in a blockbuster $1 billion deal, is expected to increase its annual sales by $200 million this fiscal year and by $300 million on an annual run rate basis.Rhode's expected contribution to sales represents about 13% of its revenue forecast, highlighting just how important the deal is to E.l.f's future as its outsized growth continues to moderate. It shows that E.l.f. needs Rhode to help it grow in the quarters ahead and without the acquisition, its potential for higher revenue could have been far slimmer.On the profitability side, E.l.f. expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.80 and $2.85, far below expectations of $3.58, according to LSEG. In addition to guidance, E.l.f. missed revenue estimates but beat on earnings in its fiscal second quarter results.Here's how the beauty company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 57 cents expectedRevenue: $344 million vs. $366 million expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $3 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with $19 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to stock-based compensation and other non-recurring charges, E.l.f. saw earnings of 68 cents per share. Sales rose to $344 million, up about 14% from $301 million a year earlier. Amin blamed the misses on revenue and guidance on the fact the company didn't release guidance last quarter, which he said can impact consensus estimates. \"We actually believe both the sales that we delivered, as well as the guidance on net sales, are quite strong,\" he said. E.l.f., which primarily sources its makeup from China, has seen its profitability crushed by President Donald Trump's new tariffs. During the quarter, its net income fell by a staggering 84% while the company said its gross margin fell by 1.65 percentage points, primarily driven by higher tariff costs. Amin said the second quarter is expected to see the greatest hit from tariffs and the impact is expected to moderate sequentially from there. \"In response to tariffs, we took our prices up $1, that was effective Aug. 1 so you're seeing tariff impact without pricing in this quarter,\" Amin said. \"In the second half of the year, gross margin will actually improve sequentially. In the absence of major product launches from its namesake brand, which Amin said are currently in the works, Rhode is E.l.f.'s primary growth driver and for now, the business is growing by about 40% year over year, he said.It launched in Sephora stores nationwide in September and was the biggest brand launch the retailer has seen in North America in its history, Amin said.\"It was two and a half times bigger than the number two, [Sephora's] second biggest launch ever, so it's performed extremely well,\" Amin said. \"We continue to see incredible potential for growth, not only in North America where we just launched and in the UK where we're about to launch, but also internationally. ... We definitely see global potential for that brand and see it being much bigger than it is today.\" ",

Stephen Cohen | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least 11 people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday afternoon, including a young child.\"Right now these families need prayers, love and support,\" he said. \"Let's wrap our arms around them during this unimaginable time.\"Beshear said he expects the fatality count could possibly reach 12 by the end of the day and signaled the team is moving from rescue to recovery mode. Earlier on Wednesday, he said the plane hit two of the \"lesser populated\" businesses in the area.Beshear also urged residents and businesses around the crash site to not drink water and declared a state of emergency for Kentucky.\"It allows us to move resources more quickly through emergency management and the Kentucky National Guard,\" Beshear said. \"It allows state resources to be used also.\"UPS said in a statement that there were three crew members on the plane. Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to the crash site Wednesday to start investigating the incident. NTSB member Todd Inman said the investigation found that a plume of fire occurred in the plane's left wing during takeoff, causing the left engine to detach from the wing. He added that investigators have located the black box, or the cockpit voice recorder, at the crash site, though it suffered some heat damage.The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. It had about 38,000 gallons of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, officials said.Inman said it was too early to determine a probable cause of the crash and said there would more information as the investigation continues. He also said he expects the team to stay for at least week.Smoke rises from the site of a UPS cargo plane crash near the UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, on November 4, 2025. Leandro Lozada | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Louisville Metro Police Department implemented a shelter-in-place order near the crash site Tuesday. Several businesses close to the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would cause an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The airport was closed Tuesday following the crash, and all departing flights for the evening were canceled. It reopened one runway Wednesday morning, and the airport encouraged travelers to monitor their flight status for delays or cancellations.UPS has its headquarters in Atlanta but the Louisville airport is home to its UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

The Starbucks Workers United is fighting for a new contract that delivers improved staffing hours, take-home pay, and on-the-job protections for baristas. (Photo by TIMOTHY A.CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A.CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)          Timothy A.clary | Afp | Getty ImagesStarbucks Workers United has authorized an open-ended strike that could begin on Red Cup Day, one of the coffee chain's biggest sales days of the year, the union announced Wednesday.The union is preparing to strike in more than 25 cities if it doesn't reach a collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks by Nov. 13, when Red Cup Day falls this year. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April.The strike authorization won 92% of votes, according to Starbucks Workers United.The union is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks.The strike would clash with Starbucks' annual giveaway of reusable red cups bearing the company's logo with any purchase. The freebie has become a collector's item for the coffee giant's biggest fans.Without an end date in sight, the strike would also disrupt Starbucks' broader holiday season, which falls during the company's fiscal first quarter and is one of the busiest times of the year for the coffee chain. Customers flock to its cafes for seasonal drinks like its peppermint mocha, along with gift cards and other merchandise.watch nowWorkers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 650 stores. (The company told CNBC that the union only represents workers at 550 cafes, accounting for some store closures over time.)In a statement, Starbucks said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.\"We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Starbucks said any agreement with the union needs to reflect the reality that it \"already offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year.\"The company is in the midst of a turnaround plan under new CEO Brian Niccol, dubbed \"Back to Starbucks,\" that has begun to show momentum. Starbucks reported in its fiscal fourth quarter that its same-store sales returned to growth for the first time in nearly two years. The coffee chain's global same-store sales rose 1%, lifted by international markets. Its U.S. same-store sales were flat for the quarter but turned positive in September. Starbucks also announced a $1 billion restructuring plan in September that involves closing some 500 of its North American stores, according to analyst estimates, and laying off 900 workers in nonretail roles. ",

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Tuesday, March 25, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLast week saw a big swing in mortgage interest rates, and that took a toll on demand. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.For the week, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.31% from 6.30% for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the weekly average, but rates actually fell to the lowest level in over a year last Tuesday and then shot up sharply Wednesday afternoon, following the announcement on interest rates from the Federal Reserve and comments from Chair Jerome Powell. Rates continued to rise Thursday, according to a separate report from Mortgage News Daily, and then came back very slightly Friday.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to daily moves in interest rates, fell 3% for the week, although they were still 151% higher than the same week one year ago. Refinancing had been on a run in the weeks before because interest rates last year at this time were higher.\"The average loan size for refinance applications was at its highest level in six weeks, as borrowers with larger loans continued to seek ways to lower their monthly payments,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 1% for the week and were 26% higher than the same week one year ago.\"Purchase applications declined slightly from a week ago, however, there was slight increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective homebuyers continue to seek loan options to help manage challenging affordability conditions,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly higher to start this week and could go more decidedly in either direction after economic data on employment is released Wednesday.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith OpenAI's recent release of its AI browser, the historic level of capital expenditures  being made in the current AI arms race may accelerate even further, if that is possible. From the reciprocal, and some have said circular, nature of hundreds of billions in  commitments in investment, tied to future chip purchases, to the extent to which GDP growth is reliant on this boom, some have said this is a bubble. A Harvard economist estimates  92% of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was due to investment in AI. But much more needs to be understood about the connection between the breakneck investment in AI and the business models that underpins the entire economy: the advertising technology (Ad Tech) industrial complex. For the past 25 years the infrastructure of the internet has been engineered to extract  advertising revenue. Search Engine Marketing, the advertising business model at the core of Google, is perhaps the greatest business model of all time. Meta's advertising  business, based on engagement and attribution, is a close second. And right behind  both of these is Amazon's advertising business, powered by its position as the largest  online retailer. While a smaller portion of Amazon's topline, its highly profitable  advertising business makes up a disproportionate percentage of Amazon's profits. So much so that nearly every major retailer has spun up their own version of retail media networks, all driving significantly to the bottom lines and market capitalization of massive companies like Walmart, Kroger, Uber (and UberEats), Doordash and many more. In fact, these platforms have been using AI to refine their advertising business models for years, in the form of algorithmic models that powered their search and recommendation engines, and to increase engagement and better predict purchase decision, seeking an ever-greater share of all commerce, not just what is typically thought of as \"advertising.\" These three multi-trillion-dollar market cap companies either wholly, or substantially, derive their profits from advertising. And now they are using some portion of those historically profitable advertising revenues to fuel infrastructure investments at a level the world has not seen outside of War Time spending by governments.But at the same time, the latest wave of AI has the potential to disrupt the very same trillions in market cap that is fueling it. AI will, without question, change how people search (Google), shop (Amazon) and are entertained (Meta). Answers delivered without clicking around the web. AI-assisted shopping. Infinite personalized content creation.If AI represents such a potential existential risk, why are Google, Meta and Amazon such a huge part of the current arms race to invest in AI? The \"moonshot\" outcome of would be that achieving Artificial General Intelligence, or Super Intelligence, AI that can do anything a human can, but better, would unlock so much value that it would dwarf any investment.But there is more immediate urgency to protect, or disrupt, the advertising business model fueling the trillions in market cap and hundreds of billions of current investment, before someone else does. While the seminal paper that launched this phase of AI, \"Attention is All You Need\" was written by mostly Google researchers, it was OpenAI and Microsoft, and now Grok as well, that launched the current AI arms race. And they are not remotely as dependent on the current advertising industrial complex. In fact, Sam Altman has called the feeds of the major platforms using AI to maximize advertising dollars, \"the first at-scale misaligned AIs.\" He is clearly stating which businesses he believes OpenAI is trying to disrupt.What comes next?This time is different, but it also comes with different risks. The major difference with the current fever in infrastructure investment vs the dotcom bubble of 2000, is that in large part the companies funding it are among the most profitable companies in the world. And so far, there has not been indications of cracks in the business model of advertising that is both funding their investments, and their market capitalizations (along with so many massive companies people wouldn't think about being in the advertising business).But if AI does disrupt, or even break, the current advertising model, the shock to the economy and markets would be far greater than most could imagine.Google, Meta and Amazon are still best positioned to create new business models, and as mentioned, have been using AI for far longer to support their advertising business models with great success. However, fundamentally changing the way people interface with search, commerce and content online will require just that, entirely new revenue models, maybe, hopefully, some that are aligned, that are not advertising based. But whatever the model, perhaps it is helpful to consider that the justification in AI infrastructure spending may not be to just unlock new revenue, but to protect the business models that make up a much more significant portion of the market capitalization of public companies than most people are aware.",

    "body": "Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon delivers a keynote speech at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. Ann Wang | ReutersQualcomm reported fiscal fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.00 adjusted vs. $2.88 expectedRevenue: $11.27 billion vs. $10.79 billion expectedRevenue rose 10% from $10.24 billion a year earlier, Qualcomm said in a statement. Due to an income tax expense, the company recorded a net loss of $3.12 billion, or $2.89 a share, after reporting net income a year earlier of $2.92 billion, or $2.59 per share.For the fiscal first quarter, Qualcomm said it expects revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.6 billion, or $12.2 billion at the middle of the range. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of $11.62 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted EPS will be $3.30 to $3.50, the company said, while analysts expected earnings of $3.31 per share.The company has long been a dominant provider of mobile phone chips, including the central processor and modem for high-end devices made by Samsung and modems for Apple iPhones.Qualcomm expects to lose Apple as a customer for its modem business in the coming years, and has been working to diversify by making chips for other devices such as Windows PCs and virtual-reality headsets and smart glasses from Meta.But the biggest opportunity is in artificial intelligence, where Nvidia has run away with the processor market and Advanced Micro Devices is trying to play catchup.Last week, Qualcomm announced that it will release new AI accelerator chips, a disclosure that boosted the stock 11%. Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack.Nvidia and AMD offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models.Qualcomm shares are up 17% for the year as of Wednesday's close, trailing the Nasdaq's 22% gain. Nvidia and AMD, meanwhile, are up 45% and 112%, respectively.Revenue in Qualcomm's handsets business rose 14% to $6.96 billion in the latest quarter. Sales in the automotive unit increased 17% to $1.05 billion. Qualcomm reports its Meta revenue under its Internet of Things (IoT) division, which had $1.81 billion in sales during the quarter, up 7% from a year earlier. All three of those segments topped estimates, according to StreetAccount. Qualcomm's licensing business saw revenue slide 7% from a year ago to $1.41 billion, also beating analyst expectations.

    "body": "watch nowMcDonald's on Wednesday fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations, but the company's U.S. restaurants reported better-than-expected same-store sales growth.CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement that the third-quarter results are \"a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment.\"For more than a year, McDonald's, long considered a bellwether for the financial health of consumers, has been sounding the alarm about a pullback in restaurant spending, particularly from low-income diners. That downturn continued during the third quarter.\"We continue to see a bifurcated consumer base with [quick-service restaurant] traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years,\" Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. \"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double digits in the quarter.\"He added that McDonald's is projecting that the pressure on consumers' financial health will continue well into 2026.Shares of the company rose more than 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.22 adjusted vs. $3.33 expectedRevenue: $7.08 billion vs. $7.1 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported third-quarter net income of $2.28 billion, or $3.18 per share, up from $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, a year earlier. McDonald's saw a higher effective tax rate during the quarter, which weighed on its earnings.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, the burger chain earned $3.22 per share.Revenue rose 3% to $7.08 billion.A McDonald's restaurant is viewed on July 22, 2024 in Burbank, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe company's same-store sales increased 3.6%, a reversal from the year-ago period's decline of 1.5% and roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations, according to StreetAccount.In the United States, McDonald's same-store sales rose 2.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 1.9%. The company credited growth in average check, suggesting that diners are paying more for their meals despite the ongoing \"value wars\" between fast-food chains.In an appeal to budget-conscious consumers, McDonald's brought back its Snack Wraps for the first time in nine years and priced them at $2.99. CFO Ian Borden said it was one of the most popular chicken launches in recent history in the U.S., with nearly 1 in 5 customers purchasing a Snack Wrap in the first four weeks.And in September, the chain reintroduced Extra Value Meals, which it last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Executives said that McDonald's value offerings have helped the chain gain market share with high-income diners.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" Kempczinski said. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Outside of the U.S., McDonald's saw even stronger same-store sales growth. Its international operated markets division, which includes Australia and Canada, reported a 4.3% increase in same-store sales.\"The value platforms we've had in place for several quarters in our IOM markets are resonating with our customers and continuing to improve value and affordability scores,\" Kempczinski said.And McDonald's international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales grow 4.7%, lifted by demand in Japan.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company is projecting stronger U.S. same-store sales growth, fueled by the return of McDonald's Monopoly and the Extra Value Meals. The chain is also facing easy comparisons to last year's fourth quarter, when an E. coli outbreak weighed on its domestic sales.However, the company's international divisions may see same-store sales growth slow next quarter as the two segments face tougher comparisons, Borden said.Correction: McDonald's priced its new Snack Wraps at $2.99. A previous version of this story misstated the price.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesLyft customers can once again earn miles toward their next flight.The ridesharing company on Wednesday said it's partnering with United Airlines to offer MileagePlus points to riders who link their accounts, months after it ended an eight-year partnership with Delta Airlines.Once linked, riders can earn one mile for every dollar spent on Standard Priority Pickup and XL rides and two miles for every dollar booked on business profiles. Extra Comfort, Lyft Black, Black SUV and regular airport rides will earn three miles per dollar. Pre-scheduled rides to and from the airport will rake in four miles per dollar.The company said rewards do not stack. Riders get the highest value multiplier on a booking.Lyft marketing chief Brian Irving told CNBC that the partnership builds on both Lyft and United's commitment to building better customer experiences.\"We have this simple, yet really customer-obsessed way of approaching things,\" he said.Earlier this year, Delta dissolved its eight-year partnership with Lyft and brought its loyalty program to ride-hailing competitor Uber.Read more CNBC tech newsAmazon upheaval: With morale shaken, Jassy looks for next big play after mass layoffsArmis raises $435 million, valuing cybersecurity startup at $6.1 billionChinese EV maker Xpeng to launch robotaxis, humanoid robots with self-developed AI chipsTrump renominates Musk ally Jared Isaacman to run NASA months after withdrawalAirlines have been amping up loyalty programs in recent years to try and grow revenues, offering new ways for customers to earn miles.United said last month that sales from its loyalty program rose 9%. The company also earns revenues through reward and co-branded credit cards.United said the agreement builds on its commitment to broadening its partnership ecosystem for customers. Other United partners include Ticketmaster and Avis, and the airline brought music streamer Spotify to seatback screens this summer.Both companies hope to expand the partnership through more tech innovation and data integration, said Richard Nunn, CEO of United's MileagePlus program.\"This is very much the start of a very deep and meaningful technology integration,\" he said.Riders will be able to redeem miles for rides directly through the Lyft app and get alerts and reminders for United flights. The capability should be available starting early next year.United is also offering 1,000 bonus miles to new Lyft riders who link their loyalty accounts and complete two rides in 30 days.",

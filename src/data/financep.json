    "body": "For parents, it's tempting to pour a lot of thought into our kids' holiday gifts. If we can just find the perfect educational toy or cultural experience, maybe our kids will become geniuses or earn soccer scholarships.It doesn't help when stores push \"genius\" toys and unforgettable experiences. But here's what parents are forgetting: The more we try to optimize our kids' holiday gifts, the more we miss out on the joy that's available right now. As a healthcare ethicist and mom of two kids, I have good news: Your child's development does not depend on finding the perfect gifts. You can resist the urge to over-engineer and still do right by your family. If you need a reset from the pressure to optimize this holiday season, here are four reframes to help lower the stakes, protect play for its own sake, and put presence ahead of performance. 1. There is no magic keyEndless reviews, algorithms, and AI tools make finding the perfect gift seem attainable. If we skip the hunt, it can feel like we didn't try hard enough. But when we zoom out, we see that this is just one of hundreds of parenting decisions we'll make this year. The effects of a single small choice, like what to get for the holidays, will be outweighed by all the other things that influence our kids' development and well-being. One gift won't set a life trajectory. So we can stop searching Amazon for the mythical gift that will magically unlock our children's potential and give them a direct path to success. Unfortunately, there isn't one. 2. More is not always betterChasing the best can backfire if we think that \"best\" means fancy or high-tech. Research shows that when it comes to play, simple, classic toys often result in more quality play than more elaborate, scripted ones. Open-ended toys leave more room for imagination.  The extra we hope to squeeze from \"perfect\" usually isn't in the product itself. It's in how we show up. As Nicola Yelland, professor of early childhood studies at the University of Melbourne, notes: \"Any toy can be educational when you play with your children and talk to them about what they are doing and learning.\" Instead of worrying about the perfect gift, we can focus our efforts on finding a good fit and then be present for it.3. Support, don't engineerWanting kids to learn and grow is good, but it's easy to take this desire too far. When our gifts or enriching plans aim to upgrade skills and talents, play starts to feel like work, which can undermine the intrinsic value. Experience gifts aren't immune to concerted cultivation efforts either. Writer Faith Hill notes that even family travel now comes with growth goals. The hope is that a trip abroad will help our kids become more adaptive, resilient, and cultured. Productivity culture can sneak in anywhere.  When we stop treating every leisure moment as productive training, however, we can create more space for joy, curiosity, creativity, and connection — values that are worth pursuing for their own sake, not just as means to future achievement. Instead of asking, \"What might this help my child become?\" we can ask, \"What might this invite my child to notice, enjoy, or share right now?\" 4. Love can be enough  Nothing we get our kids for the holidays will get them into Harvard. And that's okay.  As developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik reminds us in her book \"The Gardener and the Carpenter,\" our job as parents is not to manufacture a particular kind of child or to shape their destiny, but to create a space of love, safety, and stability where they can flourish. We don't need to calculate which gifts will give our kids the greatest developmental payoff. The holidays are a chance to help our kids feel that they matter now. And if we can do that, it's more than enough.  Jen Zamzow, PhD, is an adjunct professor of healthcare ethics at Concordia University Irvine, a writer, and a mom to two young boys.

    "body": "After Rashan Brown finished his first major gig as a spoken-word poet — opening for bestselling author and poet Rupi Kaur at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, in December 2022 — he stepped outside and celebrated on the empty winter street.\"We're changing the game of poetry,\" he said in a video recorded after the event. Standing on Tilden Avenue, grinning, he yelled, \"[One day] we're going to be in Kings Theatre — we'll sell out Kings Theatre, the Apollo [Theater].\"Brown, an ESPN product manager by day, was referencing his side hustle, a New York-based business called Poetry me, please. It's a spoken-word poetry showcase that hosts monthly events, primarily in New York. Selected artists, usually 10 per event, perform for free — in contrast to poetry events that charge performers entry fees — and get video and photos of their appearances after each showcase.Brown also performs his own work and manages other poets under the Poetry me, please brand, which he founded in 2020. It brought in $148,000 in 2024 revenue — an average of $12,000 per month — according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Most of the revenue comes from ticket sales, and it's largely offset by the cost of running the events: Poetry me, please profited $500 in 2024, and Brown reinvested that back into the business, he says. He doesn't take an income from the side hustle, despite its demanding hours — anywhere from 20 to 80 hours per week, depending on the season, he notes.Other staffers do get paid. Brown hires at least 10 contractors per event — like DJs, videographers and people manning the doors — plus a personal team including a chief of staff, agent, social media manager and project managers, he says.\"I have full creative autonomy as an entrepreneur and as a CEO, like, every decision comes back to me,\" from each show's theme to the visuals on advertising flyers, says Brown, 30. \"I really enjoy flexing those creative muscles. I felt like I always had great ideas, and I just started to implement them.\"Turning a passion into a businessBrown started writing and performing poetry in high school as a form of creative expression, he says. In January 2020, he sought out his first open mic night in New York. Being on stage \"felt like therapy\" to him — except for the $20 entry fee he paid, he says.\"It didn't sit right with me that I paid to perform\" as the crowd snapped, clapped and cheered, says Brown. \"I am providing a service. I prepped, I filled the room [with my friends].\" He started posting videos of himself performing on YouTube, then hosted his own small events with other poets in bars. Initially, he made pennies, if anything, in profit, he says. Then he hosted an event in October 2021 at a two-story restaurant where attendees could dress fancily and order food while listening to the performances. The change of setting paid off: He went home with $1,000 in profit, he says.Brown performing at the Apollo Theater in New YorkCourtesy of Rashan BrownHis next event netted over $4,000, he says. Excited, and perhaps ambitious, Brown looked up how to book New York's Apollo Theater. A one-night showcase would cost him $50,000, he discovered.Over the next year and a half, Brown hosted more Poetry me, please events. The more he posted and interacted on Instagram, the more followers and partnerships Poetry me, please landed: events at New York's Soho House and City Winery, sponsorships with companies like Eventbrite and Microsoft.In fall 2023, Brown paid a $10,000 deposit — a mix of personal savings and money from Poetry me, please — to secure a November evening at the Apollo, which he advertised heavily on social media. Roughly 1,400 people, the series' largest audience to that point, bought tickets — helping cover the rest of the event's cost, says Brown.Running a time-intensive side hustleBrown works a lot on Poetry me, please, sometimes to his own detriment, he says.In February 2024, Brown interrupted his recovery from a knee surgery to perform at a White House event for Black men in entrepreneurship. He says he was exhausted and in pain after the event. He ended up visiting a Washington D.C. emergency room that evening, he says.\"I feel like any time I've gotten really sick, it's because I've overworked,\" says Brown. \"I've learned either you can take a rest, or your body is going to make you take a rest.\"Still, the long hours — particularly each winter, when Poetry me, please has its biggest events — are worthwhile to him, he says. Helping fellow performers, inspiring an audience and working to build a poetry community outweigh his lack of a paycheck, he adds.On Nov. 29, Brown returned to the Kings Theatre — this time, to host a Poetry me, please showcase. A special guest performed that evening: Rupi Kaur.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

McDonald Event in New York City on June 13, 1995.Patrick McMullan | Getty ImagesA New York federal judge on Tuesday ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite convicted of acting as the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's procurer.Judge Paul Engelmayer's order in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan came at the request of the Department of Justice, which cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act that Congress passed nearly unanimously in November.The act mandates the disclosure of material held by the DOJ in connection with its investigations of Epstein, who died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for her conviction for procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.Grand jury materials normally are permanently sealed, and Engelmayer, in August, denied the DOJ's initial request to unseal the materials in Maxwell's case.In his order Tuesday, the judge noted that the Epstein files \"Act does not explicitly refer to grand jury materials.\"But, Englemayer added, \"The Court nonetheless holds — again in agreement with DOJ — that the Act textually covers the grand jury materials in this case.\"The judge also noted that the act \"references Ghislaine Maxwell,\" and that it covered files related to Maxwell.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "Nvidia H100 chips inside a server room at the Yotta Data Services Pvt. data center, in Navi Mumbai, India, on Thursday, March 14, 2024. Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. authorities announced Tuesday that they have shut down yet another China-linked smuggling network that trafficked or attempted to traffic more than $160 million in export-controlled Nvidia AI chips.According to a press release from a U.S. attorney's office, two businessmen were taken into custody, while a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to chip smuggling as part of the wider investigation.The case comes as Washington steps up its enforcement of export controls aimed at curbing China's access to advanced artificial intelligence technologies, including Nvidia's graphics processing units. The action, dubbed \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" exposed efforts to funnel cutting-edge AI chips — with military and civilian applications — to entities that could undermine U.S. national security, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei of the Southern District of Texas.Newly unsealed documents show that Alan Hao Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company, Hao Global, pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities on Oct. 10. Officials said Hsu and associates had exported or attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs between October 2024 and May 2025.The H200 and H100 models, while not Nvidia's most advanced chips, still require a special license to be shipped to China under current controls.Hsu's operation allegedly falsified shipping documents to misclassify the GPUs and hide their true destinations, including China, Hong Kong and other prohibited locations. Investigators traced more than $50 million in funds originating from China to help finance the scheme by Hsu and Hao Global.Hsu, who remains free on bond, faces up to 10 years in prison at his Feb. 18 sentencing, while Hao Global could be hit with fines up to twice its illicit gains plus probation. In a statement shared with CNBC, an Nvidia spokesperson said that export controls remain rigorous and that \"even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review.\"\"While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur,\" the spokesperson said.Relabeled Nvidia GPUsU.S. officials also charged Fanyue Gong, 43, a Chinese citizen residing in New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen living in Ontario, as part of their investigation.Yuan serves as CEO of a U.S. subsidiary of a Beijing-headquartered Chinese IT company, while Gong owns a New York technology firm. Both allegedly conspired independently with a Hong Kong logistics company and a China-based AI firm to evade chip controls.Prosecutors alleged Gong used straw purchasers and intermediaries to acquire GPUs by misrepresenting the end customers as being in the U.S. or in unrestricted third countries.Workers at U.S. warehouses would then rebrand shipments under fictitious names and mislabel them as generic parts for export to China and Hong Kong, according to the case. Meanwhile, Yuan is accused of recruiting inspectors for the Hong Kong firm, instructing them to conceal Chinese destinations, devising cover stories to release detained shipments and providing false information to authorities. He also allegedly handled storage for additional GPU exports.If convicted, Yuan could face up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong could receive as much as 10 years for conspiracy to smuggle.The investigation involved the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees and enforces U.S. export controls, including those on Nvidia. The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. Lawmakers have been attempting to tighten oversight of U.S. chip controls following reports of loopholes in existing rules.However, the U.S. President Donald Trump signaled this week that he would allow Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere, on the condition that Washington gets a 25% cut on the profits.Although the H200 isn't state of the art in Nvidia's lineup, it would become the most advanced model available to China and could help satiate demand for AI compute power in the country. ",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, the ICEBlock app is displayed on an Apple iPhone on October 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe developer of ICEBlock, an app used to track local sightings of ICE agents and other law enforcement authorities, sued the U.S. government on Monday for allegedly infringing his free speech rights.After Apple removed the app from its store in October, creator Joshua Aaron criticized the Trump administration for pressuring the iPhone maker to ban ICEBlock over fears it could be used to harm U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Attorneys for Aaron wrote in the complaint that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi made clear that the government \"used its regulatory power to coerce a private platform to suppress First Amendment-protected expression,\" when she said the Department of Justice demanded that Apple remove the app, which was only available on iOS.The suit claimed Apple cited one of its review guidelines that says apps can't allow objectionable content that can be used to harm a targeted group. Apple said ICEBlock targets law enforcement officers, according to the suit. Aaron told CNBC on Monday that his complaint was inspired by the U.S. founding fathers, who held the view that, \"The survival of our democratic republic isn't guaranteed.\"  \"It requires constant vigilance, active and informed participation of its citizens,\" Aaron said. \"When we see or think our government is doing something wrong, it's our duty to hold them accountable. And that is the heart of this lawsuit.\"Aaron said attorneys with law firm Sher Tremonte in New York are representing him on a pro bono basis.It's not the first time Apple has made such a move. In 2019, the company removed an app that Hong Kong protesters used to track police movements during a public dispute over the city's relationship with China. Apple said at the time that the app was removed because criminals used it to target and ambush police.Aaron had developed an Android version of his app, but said he couldn't release it. After Apple's move to remove ICE Block, Google parent Alphabet also agreed to ban apps that help people track the whereabouts of law enforcement from its app store, he said.Representatives for Apple and Google didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The DOJ didn't also didn't immediately provide a comment. Aaron launched ICEBlock in April in response to the aggressive crackdown on immigrants by the Trump administration. According to new data obtained by the University of California at Berkeley via the school's Deportation Data Project, \"more than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE officers in the first nine months of the Trump administration had no criminal histories.\" Gallup's polling data released on Nov. 28 found only 37% of US voters approved of the way Trump is handling immigration.Read the full complaint here: watch now",

    "body": "U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 20, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration announced a proposed joint settlement with Missouri that could soon force millions of borrowers in a Biden-era payment pause back into repayment. Student loan borrowers who remain enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education plan forbearance will need to select a new repayment plan, the U.S. Department of Education said in a press release on Tuesday. The entire SAVE plan has been blocked since February, when the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Republican-led states that argued former President Joe Biden lacked the authority to establish the student loan relief plan.The proposed settlement would dismiss the SAVE litigation in exchange for the Education Department agreeing not to enroll any new borrowers in SAVE and to move all borrowers currently in the plan \"into legal repayment plans,\" according to the department.As of July, the Education Department had identified more than 7.6 million borrowers in the SAVE forbearance.The GOP states had argued that Biden, with SAVE, was trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked his sweeping debt cancellation plan in June 2023. SAVE came with two key provisions that the lawsuits targeted: It had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances.This is a breaking news story.

    "body": "Google was on Tuesday hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of online content for AI purposes, marking the latest in a series of crackdowns from the bloc on regulating U.S. big tech companies. The European Commission said it was investigating whether Google had breached EU competition rules by using the content of web publishers, as well as content uploaded on the online video-sharing platform YouTube, for AI purposes.The probe will examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to that content and placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage, the Commission said. \"AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies,\" said the bloc's commissioner for competition Teresa Ribera. \"This is why we are investigating whether Google may have imposed unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, while placing rival AI models developers at a disadvantage, in breach of EU competition rules.\"The Commission said it would investigate to what extent the generation of AI Overviews and AI Mode by Google is based on web publishers' content without appropriate compensation and without the possibility for publishers to refuse without losing access to Google Search.\"This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \"Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.\"In September, the EU fined Google nearly 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) for breaching antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry.At the time, Google's global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland said the EU decision was \"wrong\" and the firm would appeal. \"There's nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before,\" she said.EU vs. U.S. big techThe move follows a slew of actions the bloc has taken against U.S big tech companies in recent days. The Commission hit Elon Musk's social media app X with a 120-million-euro ($140 million) fine on Friday for breaching transparency obligations around its advertising repository and \"the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark.'\" Musk called for the European Union to be abolished in response, with key Republican officials also criticizing the decision.Last week the EU also announced it had opened an antitrust investigation into Meta over its new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp, which it said may breach the bloc's competition rules.",

    "body": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talks during a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine at the factory of U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer in Puurs, Belgium April 23, 2021. John Thys | ReutersPfizer on Tuesday said it has struck an up to $2.1 billion licensing deal with YaoPharma to develop and commercialize its obesity pill, furthering the pharmaceutical company's push into the weight loss space. Pfizer will pay YaoPharma, a subsidiary of Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, an upfront payment of $150 million. YaoPharma could also receive up to $1.94 billion in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties on sales if the drug is approved. YaoPharma's drug works by targeting the same gut hormone, GLP-1, as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. But the pill is still in early-stage development, which means it will take several years before it reaches patients. The deal will help Pfizer beef up and diversify its obesity drug pipeline after a string of setbacks, including its decisions to scrap two different pills over the last two years. The drugmaker boosted its prospects in the competitive space with its up to $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last month, following a fierce bidding war with Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to contributing our expertise and resources to continue the development of this investigational GLP-1 small molecule which complements and strengthens our growing portfolio of novel candidates for treating obesity and its adjacent diseases,\" said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, in a statement. Under the terms of the agreement, YaoPharma will conduct a phase one trial on its drug, while Pfizer will take control of later development. Pfizer also plans to conduct studies combining YaoPharma's treatment with its own drug targeting another gut hormone receptor called GIP, which is currently in mid-stage development.That combination isn't new in the space: Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro use a dual approach of targeting both GLP-1 and GIP. In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said limited information is available on YaoPharma's drug, called YP05002. But Seigerman said he views \"obesity diversification as promising in the short term\" for Pfizer. He added that Pfizer's $150 million upfront payment reflects \"prudent capital conservation in light of the recent Metsera bidding war.\"The opportunity to enter the booming weight loss drug market could be huge for Pfizer. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.",

    "body": "Several AI applications can be seen on a smartphone screen, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, Meta AI, Grok and DeepSeek.Philip Dulian | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesCorporate leaders and investors are brimming with optimism about the potential of artificial intelligence to boost worker productivity, profitability and shareholder returns. The general public remains unconvinced. That's according to a report published Tuesday by nonprofit group Just Capital, examining how different groups are feeling about the potential risks and benefits of AI adoption. Between Sept. 27 and Nov. 14, Just Capital collected data from institutional investors and analysts, corporate executives and U.S. adults.Roughly 93% of corporate leaders and 80% of investors said they believe AI will have a net positive impact on society within the next five years, according to the report. Only 58% of respondents from the public said they share that sentiment. \"There's areas of agreement and disagreement,\" Just Capital CEO Martin Whittaker told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"What we found was overall a net positive story around AI's impact on society.\"The survey lands three years after OpenAI kickstarted the generative AI rush with the launch of ChatGPT, sparking a flood of investments into AI infrastructure, startups and products. With some analysts forecasting that AI spending will reach into the trillions of dollars by the end of the decade, the boom is boosting excitement about economic advancement and the future of technology while simultaneously raising concerns about privacy, safety and job security.The disparate views are particularly noticeable when looking at AI in the workplace.Just 47% of the general public said they think AI will have a positive net impact on worker productivity, compared to 94% of investors and 98% of corporate leaders.

Only 20% of corporate leaders agreed. Conversely, 64% of executives said AI will help workers be more productive in their current jobs, while only 23% of the public agreed. \"The survey findings reveal widespread public concern that companies' growing adoption of AI will have swift, direct consequences for workers through job cuts,\" Just Capital said. All three categories of respondents are concerned about safety and security risks that could stem from AI, but corporate leaders and investors are especially worried about disinformation and malicious use of the technology. In addition to those categories, the public is also fears loss of control and the environmental impact of AI. More than 40% of corporate leaders said environmental issues are not being factored into their AI deployment strategy, according to the report. Roughly 60% of investors and half of the public said companies should spend more than 5% of their total AI investment on safety, while 59% of corporate leaders said they should spend up to 5%.  Just Capital said it will continue to track sentiments around AI deployment every quarter. WATCH: Gibbs: AI can boost profitability without massive infrastructurewatch now",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison at Netflix's \"America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys\" at The Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles, Aug. 11, 2025.Gilbert Flores | Variety | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance laid out its plan Monday to persuade Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders that it's a better buyer for the company than Netflix. The hostile bid kicks off a tug-of-war that could get complicated. Paramount has officially launched a tender offer for current WBD shares at $30 per share, all cash. That bid is backed by $41 billion in equity financing. The remainder will be money from RedBird Capital and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. Paramount also has $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management.Paramount's tender offer will be open for 20 business days, Paramount Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon said during a conference call for investors Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery has 10 days to respond, and after the 20 business days are up, Paramount has the option to extend the deadline to keep the offer open for WBD shareholders, Gordon said.During this time, any shareholder of WBD can sell its shares to Paramount for $30. If Paramount buys 51% of outstanding shares, it would control the company. \"We do believe the [Paramount] offer should garner meaningful traction,\" Raymond James equity analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note to clients. \"That said, we believe that Netflix is committed to this deal; if [Paramount] seems to be gaining traction, we would not be surprised to see a reaction.\"That reaction could come in the form of an increased Netflix offer, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn't mention as much when speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. A prolonged battle could eventually invite lawsuits or proxy fights that would demand full shareholder votes. The WBD board said in a statement Monday it \"is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix.\" It advised shareholders \"not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance's proposal.\"Still, the board will \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery's agreement with Netflix, Inc.,\" the board said in its statement. Making a caseIf WBD shareholders seem to be convinced that Paramount's is the superior bid, Warner Bros. Discovery management could restart friendly discussions with Paramount to make sure it's getting the best deal possible. Paramount CEO David Ellison told CNBC's David Faber on Monday that the company's $30-per-share offer was not its \"best and final,\" suggesting Paramount is open to paying more for WBD if discussions begin again.Ellison hopes to convince WBD shareholders that a $30-per-share, all-cash offer is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share, cash-and-stock offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets. Ellison told CNBC on Monday that he values the linear cable networks, which aren't part of Netflix's bid, at just $1 per share. WBD internally has valued that business at about $3 per share, CNBC previously reported.If WBD reaches a deal with Paramount, WBD would owe Netflix $2.8 billion as a breakup fee — meaning Paramount may have to increase its bid, or agree to pay the fee, to adjust for the added cost. Regulatory jittersEllison said Monday that Paramount's odds for regulatory approval, combined with what he views as a higher bid, should sway shareholders that the WBD board made a mistake in choosing Netflix's offer. A Netflix-HBO max combination would create a streamer \"at such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer,\" said Ellison, noting it would be \"anticompetitive in every way you fundamentally look at it.\"Sarandos disagreed.\"We're super confident we're going to get it across the line and finish,\" Sarandos said Monday at the UBS conference. Sarandos also jabbed Paramount's estimate of $6 billion in synergies, noting those potential cost cuts would likely mean job losses.\"We're not cutting jobs, we're making jobs,\" Sarandos said.",

The facility will manufacture semiconductor products for the AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries, according to Tata Electronics. The firm is also building new facilities for assembly and testing. India, despite being one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, lacks chip design or fabrication capabilities. However, the Indian government has been working to change that as part of efforts to reduce dependence on chip imports and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market, which is shifting away from China. Under New Delhi's \"India Semiconductor Mission,\" at least 10 semiconductor projects have been approved with a cumulative investment of over $18 billion.Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the partnership with Intel was a \"tremendous opportunity\" to rapidly grow in one of the world's fastest-growing computer markets, fueled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India.",

Inside of an area that resembles the company's Bullseye logo, the company has \"The Drop,\" a rotating display of seasonal styles and curated items.Courtesy of TargetIn one of New York City's most fashion-forward neighborhoods, Target is unveiling its latest effort to keep up with trends and lead the way on style. The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is in the middle of a turnaround effort and on the cusp of a CEO change, gave a makeover to its big-box store in SoHo at 600 Broadway.The one-of-a-kind concept store, which opens Tuesday, will have rotating merchandise, curated displays chosen by celebrities and influencers and other kinds of special programming, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.The SoHo store is part of a broader push by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to win back Target's reputation for style and sharp merchandise. When he was named Target's next leader in August, he said that would be one of his top three priorities, along with improving the customer experience and rolling out technology to make Target faster and more efficient. He will start the role in February, succeeding longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Target is trying to get back to growth after roughly four years of stagnant annual sales due to self-inflicted challenges and a more difficult economic backdrop. Store foot traffic and sales have fallen as shoppers have responded to sloppier stores, out-of-stock and locked-up items and the company's decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Consumers across the country have also become more selective about buying discretionary merchandise, which has long been Target's sweet spot, as they pay more for necessities like groceries, electricity and housing.At an event previewing the store on Monday night, Fiddelke described the SoHo location as \"a punctuation point\" for Target's sense of style and its plans for the future. In an interview with CNBC, Sylvester said the store's merchandise has completely changed. The location, which opened about seven years ago, drew many shoppers and had strong sales, but sold mostly items found in drug and convenience stores, she said. It didn't carry any of Target's clothing or home decor, which felt both out of step with the neighborhood and like a missed opportunity for Target, she said.\"We said, 'This is the style and fashion capital. We have to be able to showcase the best,'\" she said, recalling the inspiration for the project.Read moreFrom start to finish, the store's redesign took four months as the company raced to get the project done ahead of the holidays, Sylvester said. It has redone the store's first floor and plans to redesign the basement floor in the coming year, she added.The SoHo store is reopening at a time when holiday shoppers and tourists flock to the major shopping district for holiday gifts and party outfits — and as Target chases sales across the country during the critical shopping season. It is one of 42 stores that the retailer has in New York City and nearly 2,000 that is has in the U.S.\"The world looks at New York to see what's new and what's next,\" Sylvester said in remarks at the launch event. \"And we want them to look at Target when they see what's new and what's next.\"A look inside Target's SoHo storyInside of a merchandise area that resembles Target's Bullseye logo, the store will have rotating merchandise that's organized around a theme.Melissa Repko, CNBCWhen customers step inside of the Target's SoHo store, they will enter a long, red hallway that resembles the inside of Target's Bullseye logo. The area of the store is called \"The Drop,\" and Target will display merchandise there chosen around themes that feel relevant for the time of year, Sylvester said. Like most of the store, the rotating area will swap out about every four-to-six weeks, she added.As the store opens, \"The Drop\" is themed around the holidays — including outfits and items that a shopper may need for going out, lounging at home or giving a gift to a party host. The store displays range across categories, mixing in clothing, home decor, beauty items and more. For example, \"The Drop\" currently includes a table of products that a shopper might want if they're hosting a night at home with friends, such as card games, an espresso martini mix and eye-catching glassware for the cocktails.Sylvester said the company's merchants are already working on the next two themes for \"The Drop,\" which will be focused on wellness in January, the season of New Year's resolutions, and Valentine's Day in February.Target's SoHo store has an eye-catching \"Beauty Bar\" that shows off fragrances, makeup items and more.Courtesy of TargetCustomers can step inside of Target's \"Broadway Beauty Bar,\" which is designed for selfies and social media posts. It will have a rotating assortment of Target's beauty merchandise, including fragrance brands like Fine'ry that are exclusive to Target, and trendy mini versions of face washes, lip glosses and more from national brands.At launch, Target is featuring items chosen by celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. Along with the \"Beauty Bar,\" the store sells items typically found at the big-box retailer, including large shampoos, body washes and cotton balls.Near the beauty area, shoppers can also press a button and snap a black-and-white selfie.Though the store's layout is new, it shares a similarity with some of Target's other New York City locations — some items are locked behind glasses cases that an employee needs to unlock.Target will tap celebrities and influencers to pick their favorite Target items for its \"Curated By\" display.Courtesy of TargetIn the back of the store's first floor, Target will have a rotating \"Curated By\" display of items from across the retailer's beauty, fashion and home categories, picked by celebrities and other creators known for their sense of style. Shoppers can browse and buy that person's favorites or scan a QR code to see a list of them.Target's first \"Curated By\" features favorites from Megan Stalter, an actress and comedian who is in HBO's \"Hacks.\" Some of her picks include a throw pillow, a pair of hot pink slippers, metallic water bottles and Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" movie-themed clothing items.Inside of the \"Gifting Gondola,\" Target will show off exclusive merchandise like plushes from its toy brand, Gigglescape, and items themed around its dog mascot, Bullseye, such as special edition Haribo candies.Courtesy of TargetAlso at the store, shoppers can find Target's \"Gifting Gondola,\" which features merchandise exclusive to Target. Currently, the display includes holiday-themed plush penguins, bears and other products from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape. It also includes some giftable items themed around the retailer's Bull Terrier, Bullseye, including special edition Haribo gummy candies and a Bullseye Pez dispenser.Over time, Sylvester said Target may introduce some items that are unique to the SoHo store and can only be bought there.

    "body": "A Google logo is at the announcement of Google's biggest-ever investment in Germany on November 11, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGoogle on Monday said it plans to launch the first of its AI-powered glasses in 2026, as the tech company ramps up its efforts to compete against Meta in a heating consumer market for AI devices. The Alphabet-owned company is collaborating on hardware design with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, with whom Google agreed to a $150 million commitment in May.Google plans to release audio-only glasses that will allow users to speak with the Gemini artificial-intelligence assistant, the company said in a blog. Google also said there will be glasses with an in-lens display that show users information such as navigation directions and language translations. The company said the first of these glasses will arrive next year, but it did not specify which styles that will include. In a Monday filing, Warby Parker said that the first of its glasses in partnership with Google are expected to launch in 2026.The glasses will be built on top of Android XR, Google's operating system for its headsets.Google's Monday updates come after the company in May announced that it would be getting back into the smart glasses game. At the time, co-founder Sergey Brin said he learned from Google's past mistakes of failed smart glasses, citing less advanced AI and a lack of supply chain knowledge, which led to expensive price points.\"Now, in the AI world, the things these glasses can do to help you out without constantly distracting you — that capability is much higher,\" Brin said in May.The AI wearables space has been gaining traction with Meta leading the pack. the social media company's Ray-Ban Meta glasses were met with surprising success. The glasses, which were designed in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, are infused with the Meta AI digital assistantMeta also released its own display glasses in September, which allows users to see features like messages, photo previews and live captions through a small display that's built into one of the device's lenses. Other companies like Snap and Alibaba have also been churning out their own AI glasses offerings as the small but competitive market continues to grow.Google on Monday also revealed more software updates to the Galaxy XR headset, including the ability to link it to Windows PCs and a travel mode that will allows the device to be used in planes and cars.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding playwatch now",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersHouse Democrats are forming a commission on artificial intelligence to position themselves as leaders on the issue as AI companies train their focus — and campaign contributions — on Washington, D.C.The House Democratic Commission on AI and the Innovation Economy, set to begin meeting this month, will work with AI companies, stakeholders and congressional committees that oversee aspects of the sector to help develop policy expertise. The commission is a response to the growing presence of AI policy and AI companies around Washington. AI companies are ramping up lobbying, opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026.There has been a growing debate over AI, specifically related to an increasing number of individual state laws that could conflict with a federal standard. OpenAI, Andreessen Horowitz and Google are lobbying to block state laws that regulate AI. Democrats have largely opposed that push. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement shared with CNBC about the working group, said Democrats are \"ready, willing and able to lean into those issues so we can uplift the health, safety and economic well-being of the American people.\"House Democratic Caucus vice-chair Ted Lieu, D-Calif., participates in the House Democrats' post-caucus news conference in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesRep. Ted Lieu of California, Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Rep. Valerie Foushee of North Carolina will lead the commission. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and Rep. Frank Pallone of Massachusetts, the top Democrats on committees that cover AI, will serve as ex-officio co-chairs. All House Democrats will be invited to participate. Lieu drew a line between how Republicans and Democrats have handled AI issues.He slammed the Trump administration for proposing to sell advanced chips to China, striking revenue-sharing agreements and posting deepfake videos. Trump announced Monday that he will allow Nvidia to send advanced H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere.

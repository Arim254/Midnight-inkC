Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday blocked the Trump administration from ceasing to pay SNAP benefits that help feed 42 million Americans during the U.S. government shutdown.The oral ruling by Judge Jack McConnell directing the administration to pay those food stamp benefits out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible\" came a day before the administration was set to cut off that assistance.\"There is no doubt, and it is beyond argument, that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food for their family,\" McConnell said.McConnell's ruling came minutes after a federal judge in Boston, who is overseeing a separate but similar lawsuit, said that the group of states that are plaintiffs in that case are likely to prove that the administration's suspension of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits was \"unlawful.\" That judge, Indira Talwani, gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case before McConnell on Friday argued that the cutoff of SNAP benefits was an \"arbitrary and capricious act\" that had caused \"a crisis\" for the Americans who need food stamps in order to eat.A Justice Department lawyer argued to McConnell that SNAP did not exist anymore because there were no congressionally appropriated funds for it as a result of the shutdown.The lawyer, Tyler Becker, also argued it was the administration's discretion whether to use up to $6 billion in contingency funds already set aside by Congress to continue issuing SNAP benefits.\"There is no SNAP program and, as a result, the government cannot just provide SNAP benefits,\" Becker said. \"A shutdown is not an emergency,\" said Becker, adding that if there was an emergency, it had been created by Congress in failing to appropriate money to keep the government operating.But McConnell told the administration to use the available contingency funds to maintain at least some of the SNAP benefits that are normally paid.The judge also said the administration needed to examine whether other federal funds would be available to keep the program operating in the absence of a funding bill by Congress.McConnell's ruling granted a temporary restraining order to plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence against the Trump administration to maintain the benefits.The Trump administration is likely to appeal the order.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural vote\"Today's ruling is a lifeline for millions of families, seniors, and veterans who depend on SNAP to put food on the table,\" the coalition of plaintiffs said in a statement.\"It reaffirms a fundamental principle: no administration can use hunger as a political weapon,\" the coalition said. \"This victory is about more than one program — it's about the American values of fairness, compassion, and accountability that hold our democracy together.\"The plaintiffs include a group of cities, charitable and faith-based non-profit groups, unions and business organizations.The Boston judge, Talwani, in her separate order on Friday, said she was still considering the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to maintain the benefits.But she also ordered the administration to tell her by Monday if it would \"authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised both rulings.\"Good,\" Schumer wrote in a post on the social media site X.\"Trump's decision to cut off SNAP was vindictive and heartless,\" Schumer wrote. \"He was trying to manufacture a hunger crisis so he wouldn't have to fix healthcare. No president in American history has cut off SNAP during a shutdown, including Trump during his own first term.\"",

    "body": "White House Lincoln Bathroom Renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialFirst the Oval Office, then the East Wing — and now, the Lincoln Bedroom's bathroom.President Donald Trump is plowing ahead with his inside-and-out remodel of the White House, and he's happy to show off the changes — even as critics slam him as \"tone deaf\" for touting glitzy renovations during a costly government shutdown.Trump on Friday afternoon shared two dozen photos of the newly refurbished bathroom, which is now covered from floor to ceiling in what the president described as \"black and white polished Statuary marble.\"Renovated Lincoln Bathroom in the White House.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth Social\"This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\" Trump wrote in one of seven Truth Social posts containing photos of the renovation.The bathroom also sports gold-colored fixtures and accents — including the bath and sink faucets, wall sconces and trash bin — as well as a crystal hanging chandelier, the photos show.Trump told NBC News in July that he planned to update the bathroom of the historic Lincoln Bedroom in a style that is truer to the era of the 16th president, who held office from 1861 until his assassination in 1865.The previous decor, an art deco green tile style, was \"totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,\" Trump wrote in Friday's post.The Lincoln Bathroom in the White House before renovation.Source: @realdonaldtrump | Truth SocialTrump's Democratic critics pounced on the construction updates, slamming him for focusing on the bathroom remodel while a government shutdown, now in its 31st day, threatens access to crucial federal services.\"Millions of people are being kicked off of food assistance and millions can't afford health care anymore. But don't worry everyone! Trump got a new bathroom,\" Democratic commentator Harry Sisson wrote in an X post.\"So tone deaf, out of touch, and disgusting,\" Sisson wrote.\"We are in a serious govt shutdown, but instead of negotiating, Trump posted several pics of his WH bathroom remodel today and now this,\" Ron Filipowski, editor in chief of the anti-Trump media outlet MeidasTouch, wrote on X.Asked for a response to those critiques, White House spokesman Davis Ingle told CNBC, \"Democrats are more concerned with President Trump's historic beautification of the White House than they are for American citizens they are hurting because of their reckless government shutdown.\"In another Truth Social post Friday, Trump announced that he had inspected construction taking place at the Kennedy Center, where, months earlier, he had fired several board members and installed himself as chair.\"It is really looking good!\" he wrote. \"The exterior columns, which were in serious danger of corrosion if something weren't done, are completed, and look magnificent in White Enamel — Like a different place!\"\"Marble is being done, stages are being renovated, new seats, new chairs, and new fabrics will soon be installed, and magnificent high end carpeting throughout the building,\" Trump wrote.The update came hours after The Washington Post reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center have plummeted in recent months.Read more CNBC politics coverageShutdown cost government contractors $12B so far: U.S. Chamber of CommerceThe big takeaways from the Trump-Xi meeting — what the truce coversShipping sector skeptical Trump's latest trade truce with China will reverse import declineTrump-Xi meeting nears with high stakes and hopes, but few detailsGovernment shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO says",

    "body": "Amid high-profile job cuts at major companies like Meta, Amazon and Target, many workers are undoubtedly anxious about future downsizing.According to Jason Walker and Rey Ramirez, co-founders of Thrive HR Consulting, a significant portion of these recent job cuts can be credited to AI.\"Companies are seeing their ability to be more efficient and use less staff with AI, and so they're taking the opportunity right now to reduce staff,\" Walker says.Another reason could be that toward the end of the year, companies \"start to look at head count, they start to look at cost, and there's just general trimming of employees based upon that,\" he says.From an employee's perspective, these job cuts may feel sudden, but there are a few signs workers should pay attention to that could indicate a coming layoff, according to Walker, Ramirez and other experts.Hiring and spending slow downAccording to Jalonni Weaver, a high-volume recruiter based in Dallas, the number one portent of an upcoming layoff is a \"slowdown in hiring.\" It's a red flag when a company stops posting new roles, or when roles remain open for months, Weaver says.That may signal that the company could be in financial trouble — and for Weaver, a decrease in recruiting work meant that her own job was in jeopardy.A hiring freeze doesn't necessarily mean that layoffs are imminent, but \"it's never a good sign that you're doing well financially,\" Walker says.Similarly, she advises workers to keep an eye out for sharp decreases in company spending. When a company is having money troubles, perks like free snacks and ping-pong tables \"go away\" she says, and year-end bonuses could shrink or vanish entirely.With these changes, \"the culture usually shifts,\" Weaver says, and \"nobody's really happy.\"Corporate messaging changesPay attention to what leaders are saying about the future of the business, Ramirez says.Phrases like \"We need to be more efficient\" are potential red flags that the company is looking to cut headcount, according to Ramirez.When a company begins to emphasize operations over innovation, \"that's usually a sign that change is coming, and that people will be impacted,\" according to Rosie Nestingen, an organizational transformation consultant.\"If one quarter you're focused on innovation and impact, and then the next quarter on 'buckling down,'\" that could be a sign of impending layoffs, she says.\"There's a lot of language that starts to [plant] the seeds and set the foundation for what is coming,\" she continues.People trickle outThe last major sign of impending layoffs is \"quiet firing,\" Weaver says, which she defines as companies \"finding ways to push people out, regardless of their performance,\" without conducting formal layoffs.For example, hourly employees may find that their typical weekly hours have been cut in half, Ramirez says.\"Employees can't afford to live on 30 or 40 or 50% less pay, so that almost by design starts to push people out of the organization,\" he says.RTO mandates can be used as another method to reduce headcount, according to Walker: after working remotely for years, studies show that many employees would rather look for another job than return to the office.If co-workers and higher-ups start leaving the company of their own accord, it might be a good idea to follow their example, Weaver says.They may be aware that the company isn't doing well, or they could be stifled by a lack of growth opportunities.How employees can prepareIf you notice red flags that could indicate impending layoffs, \"don't just ignore it or think 'it'll never happen to me,'\" Weaver says.Her biggest piece of advice for employees is to \"always keep your resume up to date,\" she says.Staying abreast of market trends is key, according to Weaver. She advises workers to peruse job descriptions for similar roles and pay attention to which skills are on the rise.Weaver recommends asking yourself, \"What has changed, what are they looking for in newer people, and how can I get that experience in my current role?\"She also suggests that employees periodically apply to other roles, \"even if you are happy at your job,\" to make sure that their resumes remain competitive.Walker has similar advice. \"Your resume should be ready to go,\" he says. \"It should look the best it's ever looked, and if you're getting an inkling of the fact that you think you're going to go, start sending it out in advance, start sending it out right away.\"In today's job market, \"you're not going to be successful with the traditional methods,\" Walker says.Instead of just sending over an application, Walker recommends connecting directly with the hiring manager for the roles you want.\"The ability to get in front of people more personally is really important right now,\" he says.Above all, don't get complacent at your job, Weaver says: \"It's okay to love where you work, but don't get too comfortable to where you miss signs that things are going on.\"\"At the end of the day, businesses are going to do what they need to do for themselves,\" she continues.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during an Amazon Devices launch event in New York City, U.S., February 26, 2025. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersAmazon shares soared 10.81% on Friday after the company reported an across-the-board beat for the third quarter and boosted its forecast for spending due to demand for artificial intelligence services.Cloud was a major driver of revenue and profit growth, with sales at Amazon Web Services climbing 20% from a year earlier to $33 billion, topping expectations.The unit generated operating income of $11.4 billion, accounting for roughly two-thirds of Amazon's total operating profit.Revenue in the digital advertising business, another growth engine, jumped 24% to $17.7 billion. Total sales at Amazon climbed 13% to $180.17 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $177.8 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings per share came in at $1.95, exceeding the $1.57 average estimate.\"Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale,\" analysts at Pivotal Research wrote in a note after the report.The analysts, who recommend buying the stock, said Amazon \"appears to have numerous healthy organic growth opportunities driven by their high margin AWS cloud segment\" and areas like advertising.Coming into earnings, cloud was an area of key concern due to increased competition from Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.

CFO Brian Olsavsky said that number will likely increase in 2026. Google, Meta and Microsoft also lifted their capex guidance, but were all below Amazon.For the current quarter, Amazon said it expects sales to be $206 billion to $213 billion. The midpoint of the revenue outlook, $209.5 billion, topped estimates of $208 billion, according to LSEG.While investors are cheering Amazon's results, it's been a tough week for a wide swath of the company's workforce.On Tuesday, Amazon said it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees, as part of a push to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, so it can move faster. More cuts are expected soon, and Jassy said it's not \"financially driven\" or due to AI, \"right now, at least.\"\"It really, it's culture,\" Jassy said. \"If you grow as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.\"The company finished the quarter with about 1.58 million employees, which was a 2% increase from the year-ago period.Sales in Amazon's core online stores unit posted growth of 10% during the quarter, which includes the results of its Prime Day discount event in July.WATCH: Apple will outperform Amazonwatch now",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building, weeks into the continuing U.S. government shutdown, in Washington on Oct. 27, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersOpen enrollment for health insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states — but millions of people may get a financial surprise when they try to sign up.That's because a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies for insurance premiums has continued with no end in sight.Consumers are \"going to get huge sticker shock, because prices are going up,\" said Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner based in Jacksonville, Florida.That sticker shock could have significant ramifications for consumers' finances and the choices they make about health coverage, experts say, contributing to a higher population of uninsured and underinsured consumers and soaring premiums in years to come.While the percentage of Americans who have ACA marketplace health insurance is small, the share could be large enough to swing a close election, KFF reported in October.ACA subsidies at the heart of the government shutdownDuring open enrollment, consumers pick their health plans for the coming year.While open enrollment generally lasts through Jan. 15, there's a Dec. 15 deadline to ensure coverage starts at the beginning of 2026.However, prospective enrollees are in financial limbo.Congress has yet to extend the enhanced subsidies that make insurance premiums cheaper for about 22 million of the 24 million Americans who buy insurance over the ACA exchanges.Recipients' health premiums are set to increase by 114% in 2026, on average, without the enhanced subsidies, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group.Certain enrollees, such as early retirees with modest incomes, face much larger increases, health experts said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageStudent loan class action effort: Trump official, credit agencies hurt borrowers' scoresTreasury Department: Series I bond rate of 4.03% through April 2026Taxpayers may see 'record tax refund season' in 2026, analysts sayMillions face 'huge sticker shock' when ACA open enrollment starts Nov. 1Here's the maximum 2026 Social Security full retirement benefit, after 2.8% COLAStudent loan forgiveness for public servants to be limited under TrumpDemocrats propose increasing VA, Social Security benefits by $200 a monthAdjustable-rate mortgages are 'underappreciated,' top advisor saysHow the 2026 Social Security payroll tax cap could impact your paycheckWhat this Fed rate cut means for your credit card, mortgage and savings accountHow the Fed's decision to lower rates could widen the generational wealth gapThis investing move is the 'holy grail of retirement planning,' advisor saysWhat another Fed cut could mean for borrowers — some rates may barely budgeWhat student loan borrowers need to know, as forgiveness resumes under two plansAmericans face a retirement 'confidence paradox': How to gauge readinessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe enhanced subsidies are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1. The shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history, behind a 35-day shutdown during President Donald Trump's first term.The enhanced subsidies, also known as enhanced premium tax credits, have been available since the Biden administration passed them in 2021 and extended them in 2022. They are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025.Democrats are pushing to extend the subsidies as part of a deal to end the shutdown. Republicans have said they want to negotiate the subsidies separately.More than half, 57%, of ACA marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts, according to a KFF analysis from earlier this month. This year, about 80% of all premium tax credits, or $115 billion, went to ACA marketplace enrollees in states won by President Trump in last year's election, KFF found.There are 39 congressional districts where at least 10% of the population is enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and where, had it not been for enhanced subsidies, their 2024 average premium payments would have been double or more, according to KFF.These districts are largely concentrated in Trump-won states: The bulk, 20, are in Texas, with another seven in Florida and three in Georgia.What this means for open enrollmentAbsent a deal, many people who try to enroll in a health plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see significantly higher premiums during open enrollment, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.The financial stakes vary according to factors such as household income, age and state.For example, the average 60-year-old couple making $85,000 would see their annual premiums increase more than $22,600 in 2026, according to KFF.A 45-year-old earning $20,000 in a state that didn't expand Medicaid would see premiums rise from $0 to $420 per year, on average, it found.Maskot | Getty ImagesThere are many potential implications to the congressional impasse and consumers' sticker shock during open enrollment, Cox said.Many people may opt not to sign up for coverage rather than pay higher premiums, and therefore would be uninsured, Cox said.Others, such as self-employed entrepreneurs and gig workers, may choose to try to find a more traditional job that offers employer-based health insurance so they don't have to sign up for a marketplace plan, Cox said.Some people may opt to buy lower-tier plans that come with smaller upfront premiums but much higher deductibles on the back end, meaning they'd be on the hook for a hefty bill if they need to use their insurance, Cox said.If young, healthy people don't enroll, insurers would be left with a relatively older, less healthy population of enrollees — likely leading insurers to raise their annual premiums even more in the future due to the pool of higher-risk enrollees, she said.The damage may be done, even if Congress does eventually extend the enhanced subsidies, experts said.\"There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium,' and they don't come back to look again even if there were a subsequent enactment of enhanced subsidies,\" said Jonathan Burks, executive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.What prospective ACA enrollees should doAs things stand, enhanced subsidies will expire.Prospective enrollees in an ACA marketplace plan should pick their 2026 health insurance coverage with this in mind, Cox said. In other words, don't pick a plan based on the expectation that Congress will extend the enhanced subsidies, she said.However, she recommends enrollees pay close attention to the news. If Congress reaches a deal, enrollees should come back and look again, because their options and costs may have changed, Cox said.\"If it were me, I'd probably make a note on my calendar to shop over Thanksgiving or in early December,\" with an eye to the Dec. 15 deadline, Cox said.There's certainly a very real possibility that people will log on Nov. 1 and say, 'Gosh, I can't afford that premium.'Jonathan Burksexecutive vice president of health and economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy CenterLuckily, the open enrollment period offers relative flexibility, Burks said.Consumers can pick a plan and select another plan later within the open enrollment period without consequence, he said.\"People shouldn't feel the need to rush into a decision, nor is there a real cost if they make a decision early on, [then] circumstances change and they want to evaluate that decision before the end of the open enrollment period,\" Burks said.Current enrollees who take no action will be reenrolled into the same plan or a similar one if the current plan is no longer available, experts said.How to think through health insurance decisionsEven consumers who are healthy and rarely go to a doctor should have insurance, even a plan with a high deductible, in case there's a major unforeseen health event, said McClanahan, the founder of Life Planning Partners and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Those with minor health issues such as hypertension or diabetes and who see a doctor regularly can consider buying a high-deductible plan — which generally carry lower upfront premiums — on the ACA marketplace, she said.Pair that coverage with a direct primary care physician model. Such doctors charge a subscription for care — maybe $150 or $200 a month — and provide all basic primary care such as basic laboratory tests and imaging services, she said.Those with serious illnesses who go to the doctor frequently would be best suited by buying a good health insurance plan with a broad network of doctors and, ideally, a lower deductible, McClanahan said.Of course, this may be challenging for households that lose enhanced subsidies, she said.",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesKorean semiconductor giant Samsung said Thursday that it plans to buy and deploy a cluster of 50,000 Nvidia graphics processing units to improve its chip manufacturing for mobile devices and robots.The 50,000 Nvidia GPUs will be used to create a facility Samsung is calling an \"AI Megafactory.\" Samsung didn't provide details about when the facility would be built.It's the latest splashy partnership for Nvidia, whose chips remain essential for building and deploying advanced artificial intelligence.The agreement with Samsung comes after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday announced in Washington, D.C., that Nvidia was collaborating with companies including Palantir, Eli Lilly, CrowdStrike and Uber.Shortly after the speech, Huang was spotted in South Korea drinking beer with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other business leaders, according to local media. Other Korean companies, including SK Group and Hyundai, are also deploying similar amounts of GPUs, Nvidia said.\"We're working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,\" Raymond Teh, Nvidia's senior vice president of Asia-Pacific, said on a call Wednesday with reporters.The partnerships support Huang's claim on Tuesday that Nvidia has a book of business that totals $500 billion from its current generation GPU, called Blackwell, in addition to its next-generation GPU, called Rubin.The forecast helped boost Nvidia's stock, making the company the first to reach a market cap of $5 trillion.On Thursday, Nvidia representatives said they will work with Samsung to adapt the Korean company's chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia's GPUs. That process will results in 20 times better performance for Samsung, the Nvidia representatives said. Samsung will also use Nvidia's simulation software called Omniverse. Known for its mobile phones, Samsung also said it would use the Nvidia chips to run its own AI models for its devices.In addition to being a partner and customer, Samsung is also a key supplier for Nvidia.Samsung makes the kind of high-performance memory Nvidia uses in large quantities, alongside its AI chips, called high bandwidth memory. Samsung said it will work with Nvidia to tweak its HBM4 memory for use in AI chips.WATCH: Night out in Seoul: Nvidia, Samsung, and Hyundai bosses bond over fried chicken and sojuwatch now",

They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the past one year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000.It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each a holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same.Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a \"B\" class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Netflix stock is up 42% for the past one year.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChevron on Friday reported third-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates, as the company achieved record production due in part to its acquisition of Hess Corp.The oil major's net income declined 21% to $3.54 billion, or $1.82 per share, compared with $4.49 billion, or $2.48 per share, in the same period last year. Its earnings decreased year over year due to falling oil prices and a $235 million loss on transaction costs associated with the Hess acquisition.Excluding costs associated with Hess and foreign currency impacts, Chevron earned $1.85 per share, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.68 per share. It reported revenue of $49.73 billion in the quarter, down about 2% from the $50.67 billion in the year-ago period.Chevron's shares were trading more than 3% higher.Here is what Chevron reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.85 adjusted vs. $1.68 expectedRevenue: $49.73 billion vs. $49.01 billion expectedU.S. crude oil prices have fallen about 16% this year as OPEC+ increases production and President Donald Trump's tariffs have the market worried about an economic slowdown.Even with lower prices, Chevron pumped a record 4.1 million barrels per day, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year. Higher production came from the Hess acquisition, the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico and Kazakhstan, according to the company.Chevron's U.S. production business posted a profit of $1.28 billion, down 34% compared with $1.95 billion in the third quarter of 2024. It pumped 2 million barrels per day, up 27% from 1.6 million bpd in year-ago period.International production recorded earnings of $2 billion, down 24% compared with $2.64 billion in the same quarter last year. Production increased 16% to 2 million bpd compared with 1.76 million bpd in the year-ago period.Profit increased more than 300% to $638 million in Chevron's downstream U.S. refining business, compared with $146 million in the third quarter of 2024. Refining profits increased year over year due to higher margins on product sales. International refining posted earnings of $499 million, up 11% from $449 million in the year-ago period.Capital expenditures increased 7% to $4.4 billion over the year-ago quarter because of spending on legacy Hess assets. Chevron's adjusted free cash flow rose about 50% to $7 billion over the year-ago period.Correction: Chevron reported earnings of $1.85 per share compared with $1.68 expected by an LSEG survey of Wall Street analysts.

    "body": "Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season.President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year.While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower.\"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\"Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins.Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August.These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate.For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest.Impact at the cash registerIn real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher.\"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\"The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs.\"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said.Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources.LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025.\"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\"Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTech's internet giants have made it through earnings season, and they offered a consistent message to Wall Street: Artificial intelligence investments are only getting bigger.Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures and now collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.Microsoft's forecast was for fiscal 2026, which ends in June.The companies are racing to build out infrastructure for what they say is virtually limitless demand for AI services.Meanwhile, a growing number of skeptics are voicing concerns that these historic spending levels are fueling a bubble, and they're questioning whether there's sufficient energy and resources to ever turn lofty AI promises into reality.As big as the spending projections were this week, they look pedestrian when compared with OpenAI, which has announced roughly $1 trillion worth of infrastructure deals of late with partners including Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.Investor reactions to the megacap reports were mixed.Amazon saw its stock soar after the company beat on earnings and revenue, and said capex this year will be about $125 billion, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion.\"We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI,\" finance chief Brian Olsavsky said on the earnings call, adding that the number will grow in 2026. \"We believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term.\"watch nowInvestors also cheered Alphabet, which reported an earnings beat and boosted its capex forecast for this year to between $91 billion and $93 billion from a prior range of $75 billion to $85 billion. The stock rose 2.5% on Thursday.But Microsoft shares fell about 3% even though the software company's results exceeded estimates.CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call that capex growth would accelerate in fiscal 2026, which started in July, after the company had previously said growth would slow. Capex rose 45% to $64.55 billion last fiscal year, suggesting a minimum of about $94 billion in 2026. That number is significantly higher when including leases.Meta's stock was hit harder, plummeting 11% on Thursday, its steepest drop in three years, despite an across-the-board beat. The company narrowed its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion, from a prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion.'Unknown revenue opportunity'Unlike Amazon, Microsoft and Google, Meta doesn't have a cloud service and lacks a clear revenue story that's tied to its AI investments.Meta says its benefits from AI come elsewhere, namely improved performance in its core digital ads business from better targeting.Still, analysts at Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, citing an \"unknown revenue opportunity\" in what the company is calling superintelligence, and said investors will struggle with \"aggressive revenue growth offset by high spending.\"Google, by contrast, has \"predictable earnings,\" the analysts wrote.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in June the creation of the company's Superintelligence Labs, and said it would be led by some of his company's costly high-profile hires, including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.The lab would house the company's various teams working on foundation models, Zuckerberg wrote in a memo at the time.\"I'm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone,\" Zuckerberg wrote.But the Oppenheimer analysts said it's an approach that \"mirrors\" the company's metaverse spending in 2021 and 2022, when Zuckerberg was declaring that platform to be the future of computing.Meta is still burning billions of dollars a quarter on its investments in augmented reality. The company said in its earnings report that its Reality Labs unit lost $4.4 billion in the quarter on $470 million in revenue.'No end in sight'Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesFor the other hyperscalers, investments in AI largely tie into their cloud infrastructure businesses, even as they're using AI companywide.Within cloud computing, Amazon Web Services is still bigger than Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, but it's growing more slowly than its rivals.AWS reported revenue growth in the third quarter of 20% to $33 billion. Microsoft said Azure revenue increased by 40%, while Google's cloud sales rose 34% to $15.15 billion.Analysts at Cantor said that clouds with \"expansive service stacks like Microsoft\" are in a position to benefit from this \"heightened phase of AI infrastructure build out.\"They recommend buying the stock, but see reasons to be worried about the spending forecast. The analysts said that total capex, which includes capital leases, is poised to reach $140 billion this year, up 58% from a year earlier and triple the figure from fiscal 2024.That number \"is reflective of strong demand on the positive side, but remains a concern as there appears no end in sight,\" the analysts wrote.WATCH: Meta capex doesn't necessarily result in ROIwatch nowRead more CNBC tech newsNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI is in a 'virtuous cycle.'

Brian Kaiser | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesExxon Mobil is holding advanced talks with power providers and technology companies to cut the emissions of AI data centers that rely on natural gas by deploying carbon capture technology, CEO Darren Woods said Friday.\"I'm hopeful that many of these hyperscalers are sincere when they talk about the desire to have low emission facilities, because certainly in the near to medium term we're probably the only realistic game in town to accomplish that,\" Woods said on Exxon's earnings call.Hyperscalers refers to companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft that are building large data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications.Exxon aims to capture 90% of the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by natural gas plants that power data centers, Woods said. The oil major is talking with power companies to decarbonize their plants, he said. \"We're pretty advanced in the conversations,\" the CEO said.The tech sector has mostly secured renewable energy to offset the emissions from their data centers, though they are now making major investments in nuclear power as well.Some companies are turning to natural gas as well as they search for reliable power. Meta, for example, signed an agreement with the utility Entergy in Louisiana to power a data center campus with natural gas.\"We secured locations. We've got the existing infrastructure, certainly have the know-how in terms of the technology of capturing, transporting and storing [carbon dioxide],\" Woods said.",

Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

    "body": "When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: \"What's wrong?\"It's well-intentioned and it comes from care. But after years of teaching conscious parenting and studying over 200 kids, I've seen how often that question does the opposite of what parents hope. Instead of opening children up, it can shut them down.Emotional intelligence develops when children feel safe enough to reflect. Without that foundation, even the most caring questions can feel overwhelming in the moment.Across my research, one sentence reliably helped children pause, reflect, and communicate more openly: \"Tell me what feels hard right now.\"This magic phrase works because it matches how children actually experience emotions in real life. Rather than pushing for clarity or explanations, it creates the conditions where insight can emerge naturally.1. It reduces defensiveness before the conversation even beginsDuring meltdowns, after-school emotional releases, or moments of sudden irritability, children are already on edge. The word \"hard\" feels human and non-threatening. It signals to your child that they aren't in trouble and don't need to justify their feelings, making it easier to stay engaged instead of shutting down or pushing back.2. It allows emotional language to develop organicallyChildren don't need to label emotions precisely. They can describe a situation, a sensation, or a moment that felt overwhelming. Over time, this gently expands emotional language, allowing insight to develop naturally rather than being forced before a child has the words.3. It establishes emotional safety before problem-solvingBefore problem-solving, before advice, before correction, this phrase tells a child: \"I can handle what you're feeling.\" Emotional intelligence grows in welcoming environments where emotions are met with steadiness instead of urgency.4. It gives children agency over what they shareRather than demanding an explanation, this question invites reflection. The child decides how much to share and when, reinforcing a sense of agency over their emotional experience, which is an essential foundation for self-regulation and confidence.5. It helps calm the nervous system firstWhen children feel emotionally safe, their stress response begins to settle. This phrase is especially effective when behavior feels disproportionate or confusing because it prioritizes regulation before reasoning.6. It normalizes emotions as part of everyday lifeBy focusing on what feels hard, parents communicate that emotions can be noticed without being rushed or fixed. It teaches kids that feelings can be experienced and moved through rather than avoided or suppressed.7. It demonstrates emotional intelligence in real timeChildren learn emotional intelligence through experience, not instruction. When parents respond with calm curiosity instead of control or urgency, they model how to approach emotions with steadiness and reflection. These are skills children eventually apply to themselves.Our job as parents is to create an environment where our children feel safe sharing their inner worlds. When you adjust your language, you shape the emotional tone of your relationship. Over time, children learn that their feelings are important signals that deserve attention.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037AlaskaAnnual cost of living: $78,449Savings you need to retire: $1,400,286ArizonaAnnual cost of living: $66,838Savings you need to retire: $1,110,019ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538CaliforniaAnnual cost of living: $83,978Savings you need to retire: $1,538,508ColoradoAnnual cost of living: $63,091Savings you need to retire: $1,016,336ConnecticutAnnual cost of living: $70,094Savings you need to retire: $1,191,417DelawareAnnual cost of living: $63,152Savings you need to retire: $1,017,871FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933HawaiiAnnual cost of living: $110,393Savings you need to retire: $2,198,902IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MaineAnnual cost of living: $70,155Savings you need to retire: $1,192,953MarylandAnnual cost of living: $73,043Savings you need to retire: $1,265,135MassachusettsAnnual cost of living: $92,639Savings you need to retire: $1,755,055MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931MontanaAnnual cost of living: $67,452Savings you need to retire: $1,125,377NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New HampshireAnnual cost of living: $67,084Savings you need to retire: $1,116,163New JerseyAnnual cost of living: $70,401Savings you need to retire: $1,199,096New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684New YorkAnnual cost of living: $77,773Savings you need to retire: $1,383,392North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284OregonAnnual cost of living: $68,681Savings you need to retire: $1,156,093PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331Rhode IslandAnnual cost of living: $69,664Savings you need to retire: $1,180,666South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VermontAnnual cost of living: $69,848Savings you need to retire: $1,185,274VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405WashingtonAnnual cost of living: $69,971Savings you need to retire: $1,188,345West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

    "body": "If Indiana University wins the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday, fans will owe some thanks to one of the football program's biggest financial donors: billionaire Mark Cuban.Cuban, whose net worth is estimated at $9.6 billion by Bloomberg, graduated from IU with a degree in management in 1981. He's a longtime donor to his alma mater, including $5 million for a sports media center in 2015 and $6 million for IU's rugby team in 2024.While Cuban hasn't disclosed the size of his recent donations to IU's athletic department, it was a \"big number,\" the billionaire told CBS in October 2025. The team's recent success under head coach Curt Cignetti, hired in 2024, inspired Cuban to open his checkbook again: The school is \"happier this year than last year\" after his latest donation, Cuban told Front Office Sports on Jan. 7.Now, Cignetti's team is just one win against the University of Miami away from a national championship and Cuban says it's because the coach understands the most important aspects of building a successful organization.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agents\"I've been part of championship organizations and putting together a team isn't easy,\" Cuban told Bloomington, Indiana's The Herald-Times on Jan. 10. The billionaire was the majority owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks when that team won an NBA championship in 2011, and remains a minority owner of the team today.Cuban discussed team-building strategy with Cignetti and came away impressed, he said. The coach assured Cuban that the team would use his donations to recruit a well-rounded roster of players, rather than putting the money toward chasing after just a few high-profile recruits, said Cuban.\"It's about getting players that know their roles, work as a team, continue to improve and work in the system,\" Cuban told the newspaper. \"When you have a coach and organization that understands that, that's how championship teams and organizations are built. That's why I've been so excited to support them.\"Culture and competencyCuban has previously spoken about how good leaders build successful businesses through hiring the right people. Leaders should avoid hiring people who don't fit their company culture, \"because you can't have conflict on what the vision of the company is,\" he said on a March 2021 episode of the \"Starting Greatness\" podcast. \"You've got to hire the right people for the right roles.\"Every winning team, or successful business, needs those employees who excel in their specific roles, like the \"glue guys\" on a basketball team, Cuban added on \"Starting Greatness.\" Culture and competency are the two biggest considerations for leaders when building a team, Cuban said during a MasterClass course released in February 2024. Cuban chose to attend IU because, at the time, the university offered the cheapest tuition out of the country's top 10 business education programs, he's said. He's credited his time at the school for exposing him \"to all kinds of different people [and] ideas\" while nurturing his early entrepreneurial skills: Cuban opened and ran a local bar as an undergraduate, and picked up extra cash teaching dance lessons.\"Just watching the team I grew up with from the time I was 18 years old [and] to be part of this, wow,\" Cuban told The Herald-Times. \"What it gives me is far more than anything I could give to IU. No one would know who the hell I am if it wasn't for Indiana University.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Bozoma Saint John doesn't shrink away from the spotlight.Saint John, 48, was Netflix's first Black C-level executive as their chief marketing officer. She became Uber's first chief branding officer tasked with rehabbing the rideshare company's image. And she made headlines in 2016 when she shook up the stage at Apple's annual conference despite not looking like a typical \"Apple fan boy,\" she says.Saint John's career moves are as as bold as her personal style. And she has what she considers some well-meaning but misguided advice to thank for that.\"An early manager told me never to wear red lipstick or red nail polish,\" Saint John tells CNBC Make It when asked about the best career advice she's ever gotten.\"She did it with good intention, like, 'You walk into a room and you don't want to be too bold. You don't want people to make opinions of you before you even open your mouth,'\" Saint John says. But \"that made me question my appearance in rooms. Being a Black woman who's quite tall and bold in her wardrobe, I found that it really shrank me.\"Saint John says she decided to ignore that advice and flip it on its head to \"be the most colorful, the boldest, the sharpest, the wittiest in a room, and feel very confident in it.\"\"I've been able to be successful because I didn't take that advice,\" she says.Saint John continues to go after big changes in her career, becoming a first-time CEO for her own hair and beauty brand, Eve by Boz, and most recently adding \"reality TV star\" to her resume a cast member of Bravo's \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" and as co-host of NBC's \"On Brand with Jimmy Fallon.\"And she wants you to go after your big career swings, too.With people approaching a new year with new work goals, Saint John says it's a good time as any to go after what you really want in your career. \"That the pivot can happen any moment,\" she says.Here, Saint John draws on her own career and experience managing thousands to share the signs it's time to quit a job, how to shape your professional brand, a major red flag when interviewing with companies, and more.When you know it's time to quit a jobMy advice is usually if you get the Sunday scaries, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you are coming back from the holiday and you feel the ache in your stomach that you don't want to go back to your job, or you're dreading it so much so that you can barely sleep, then I think that's a pretty big indication that you've got to go now.The big mistake people when going after a raise, promotion or quittingIf you want a promotion or more experiences within your job, set a timeline by which you can hit that goal or decide it's time to leave. Create a timeline with your boss.A lot of times people approach that promotion or the raise conversation from a very self-centered standpoint. What the company and your manager wants to hear is how it's going to help the company and the wider community of your colleagues.So if you position it as: \"By March 1, I want to be promoted to X position, and this is how I'm going to execute my job to get take on more responsibility or help the company achieve X, Y and Z goal,' that gives you some building blocks and a timeline to get to March 1. When you're mid-career trying to get to the next step, you should absolutely have a plan to make sure that you're talking to your boss with a timeline in mind.It's such a mistake to think that this is all you, that you've got to put in the ideas for how you're going to get ahead. If you don't include your manager in your timeline, they have no idea what what goal you're trying to hit.Lay the groundwork so that by the time you have that conversation, everybody is well aware that either you've hit the goal to get that raise or promotion, and if you do your part and don't have it by March 1, everybody's on the same page: 'I'm quitting.'How to be in control of your own professional brandRegardless of if you're on TV or you're sitting in a cubicle, I believe your personal brand  is important, and to some degree you don't have control. So you have to take as much control as possible. If you're sitting a cubicle in an open floor plan and somebody doesn't appreciate your work, your responsibility is to make sure that the brand narrative about yourself is that you're hardworking or that you're creative or that you're a problem solver.

Don't try to cut down the edges of yourself so that you can fit in better. The way that you make yourself memorable is to actually be memorable. There are so many beautifully unique things about each of us, our experiences, the history that we come with, that weaving that into your answers and into the conversation that you're having is actually what's going to make somebody remember you.We often think that as human beings, we have to have similar interests or similar tastes with somebody so that they get along with us and want to hire us. And I think it's actually quite the opposite. Curiosity, wanting to know somebody because you're like, 'They're from this place, or they've had this experience, and that could add to the job because I don't have that experience' is actually how you want to be perceived in an interview.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Signage at the Broadcom Inc. headquarters in San Jose, California, June 2, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInvestors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks.Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.BroadcomThis week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393.The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are \"hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon.\"While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted.Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to \"many many millions\" in 2026. He added that TPU v8 shipments are expected to touch hundreds of thousands of units per month in a few months, and millions by the end of this year. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today.Rasgon ranks No. 120 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 30.7%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks. AirbnbTravel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. In his research note on the outlook for the U.S. internet space, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as one of the top ideas for 2026. The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $156. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153.Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market.\"We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership,\" said Walmsley.The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals.Walmsley expects the hotel expansion, along with the book now, pay later conversion benefits, to reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2026 and lift ABNB stock's valuation multiple.Walmsley ranks No. 158 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Airbnb Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Meta PlatformsWalmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. The top-rated analyst reiterated a buy rating on META stock with a price target of $815. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on META stock with a price target of $753.Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending.\"We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment,\" Walmsley said.The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026.Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses.See Meta Platforms Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Recently the Australian Senate passed a law to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X. Matt Cardy | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAustralia's social media ban for children under the age of 16 has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms, including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. The platforms were forced to implement age verification methods to ensure under-16s are unable to create an account, and the companies can face fines up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for not complying. Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. \"This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond,\" Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access.\"We're already seeing countries move in this direction, and as confidence builds and evidence accumulates, more will follow. No one thinks the status quo is working for children, parents, or society – and this is one of the clearest policy responses currently on the table,\" Greenwell added. Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. Iyer has worked closely with social psychologist Jonathon Haidt who wrote the renowned book The Anxious Generation, about the harmful impacts of social media and smartphones on children and teens. \"It's really hard to predict Federal policy, but it is one of the few bipartisan issues left, so it certainly is possible,\" Iyer said in emailed comments. \"I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years.\"Lawmakers in California and Texas are looking at bringing in state-level bans in 2026. But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: \"It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires.\"U.K. set to vote on social media ban Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. The U.K.'s House of Lords is expected to vote this week to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. The SFC template email urged the government to set \"reasonable, age-appropriate boundaries that protect children's wellbeing.\" \"We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world,\" Greenwell told CNBC. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying \"we need to better protect children from social media\" and that he's studying Australia's ban. \"All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time,\" Starmer said last week. \"Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens,\" he added.Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are \"numerous\" and well documented. USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. \"One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so\" Iyer said. \"It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. If we can solve that problem and the majority of teens are off of social media, we'll have done a lot of good,\" he added. Read more",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Coolpicture | Moment | Getty ImagesAs you gauge how much income you'll need to pay for your living expenses in retirement, don't forget to consider how you'll cover unexpected costs.More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income.Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets.\"About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement,\" the research notes. The research uses data from 3,427 retired households that have been part of the 2000-2020 Health and Retirement Study and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the University of Michigan.It's important to have some cash savingsWhile experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement.As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness.\"That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs,\" said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research.While some households may struggle to set aside money, \"even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur,\" Chen said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income.\"This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend,\" the report notes.Think in terms of 'access to cash for surprises'So how much should you have set aside? Depending on a retiree's individual situation, financial advisors may recommend anywhere from three or six months' worth of expenses to a couple of years — or a variation of those parameters. Much of it will depend on your individual situation.\"What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs,\" said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.\"For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions,\" Um said.The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said.\"Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more,\" Um said. \"The goal isn't to maximize cash. It's to have enough on hand to avoid selling long-term investments at the wrong time.\"In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down.Avoid having too much in cashHowever, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis.\"Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much,\" Lazaroff said. \"From purely a mathematical standpoint, you're giving up too much of a return.\"The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. The latest reading of the consumer price index showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in December. \"Your cash just becomes less valuable every year,\" he said. \"You're putting your purchasing power at risk.\"He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.",

    "body": "Twenty47studio | Moment | Getty ImagesTax changes for 2026 offer new ways for individuals ages 65 and over to plan financially.That is largely due to a new temporary senior \"bonus\" or deduction of up to $6,000 per qualifying individual that was enacted when President Donald Trump signed the \"big beautiful bill\" package into law last July. A married couple filing jointly could qualify for a deduction of up to $12,000.The $6,000 senior deduction is in effect from tax years 2025 through 2028. It applies to taxpayers 65 and over, regardless of whether they itemize their tax returns or take the standard deduction. Retirees may not have made full use of the break since it was implemented partway through last year, experts say, but the next three years of planning could be key.\"This three-year window is an incredible, valuable opportunity,\" said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder and principal of MiklosCPA Inc., an accounting and tax strategy firm in Southern California.\"It's three times $12,000, plus adjusted for inflation,\" Ringbauer said. \"That's a lot of savings that we can build in for further down the road.\" Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

However, because it is not a tax credit, they will not necessarily receive those sums back in their refunds.The impact of the deduction could be vast, Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said during a Jan. 15 briefing on the tax changes.The Council of Economic Advisers, an agency within the executive office of the president, estimates about 33.9 million seniors may qualify for the new senior deduction and receive an average $670 increase in after-tax income per eligible taxpayer.\"That's four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs,\" Sweeney said.Who qualifies for the new $6,000 senior deductionSeniors must have a modified adjusted gross income under certain thresholds to qualify for the full deduction — up to $75,000 if single or $150,000 if married and filing taxes jointly. The deduction is gradually reduced for taxpayers with incomes over those thresholds and fully phases out for individuals with $175,000 or more in income and married couples with $250,000.On the campaign trail, Trump pitched eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. Yet because the law was passed by a legislative process known as reconciliation, Republican lawmakers could not directly make that change. Instead, the new senior deduction is aimed at replacing the income that any federal taxes on Social Security benefits may take away. Federal taxes on Social Security benefits that are still in effect make it so beneficiaries may face levies on a formula called combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of Social Security benefits. Up to 50% of Social Security benefits are taxable for individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income, and married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000. Up to 85% of benefits are taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income and married couples with over $44,000.   The \"big beautiful\" tax package includes other tax changes that individuals ages 65 and over may take advantage of — a higher standard deduction and state and local tax deduction, a deduction of up to $10,000 per taxpayer for interest on new auto loans, plus no tax on tips or overtime pay for those who are still working.\"With tax changes come tax planning opportunities,\" said Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and president of Covisum, a Social Security claiming software company. Senior deduction as a four-year planning opportunityNotably, the new $6,000 senior deduction applies to individuals 65 and over, whether they have claimed Social Security benefits or not, Elsasser said. \"Don't just focus on the temporary additional senior deduction as a reduction of Social Security tax,\" Elsasser said. \"Instead, think of it as a four-year additional deduction that could be applied against any kind of income.\"The new change went into effect with the 2025 tax year. Yet some individuals may not have been mindful of their taxable income for the year with the new senior deduction in mind, according to Ringbauer.For example, if taxpayers ages 65 and over had a very successful year in the stock market in 2025, they may be phased out of the full deduction that could have been available to them, Ringbauer said.For tax years 2026 and beyond, older individuals may want to focus on how to stay within the deduction's income limits, he said.Individuals who are age 65 and up and still working may be able to reduce their taxable income by contributing to a retirement plan. In 2026, individuals ages 50 and older may be able to contribute up to $32,500 to a 401(k)-retirement plan, including catch-up contributions. Individuals ages 60 to 63 may be able to set aside up to $35,750, with super catch-up contributions.Older taxpayers may also consider reducing their taxable income through charitable contributions.watch nowIndividuals ages 65 and older also want to be aware of other potential sources of income — such as required minimum distributions or Roth conversions — that may affect the size of their taxable income and therefore eligibility for the senior deduction, Ringbauer said.The new senior deduction will reduce taxes on other income, not just Social Security, according to Elsasser.Consequently, for taxpayers who have financial flexibility, it may make sense to withdraw money from IRAs or other retirement accounts while the temporary deduction is in place, he said. Those withdrawals may also help reduce required minimum distributions later, which can also help limit retirees' future income subject to taxes. Notably, that strategy may also help individuals ages 65 and over to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits. Delaying Social Security provides a guaranteed return of 8% per year from full retirement age — typically age 66 or 67 — up to age 70.Those who have already claimed Social Security retirement benefits and who have reached full retirement age may consider voluntarily suspending their monthly checks while the senior bonus is in effect to let their future monthly benefit checks grow, Elsasser said.

    "body": "Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale, attends an AI summit in Paris in February 2025.Getty ImagesThe founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to \"move fast and break things,\" and \"continuously iterate and test and improve.\"Berge said: \"It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company.\" Corporate experience 'matters less'Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. \"I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,\" he said. Fridjtoff added that it \"matters less\" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. \"You might not think with a blank-slate state,\" he said. \"I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,\" he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.\"He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,\" Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. \"I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,\" He added.

    "body": "Many people think that if they're determined enough — if they push themselves really hard — they'll be able to create better habits.Those people are missing an important piece to the puzzle of self-control, according to James Clear, author of The New York Times bestselling book \"Atomic Habits.\" Even if you're disciplined, you likely need to put yourself in environments that allow you to stay that way, free of distractions or opportunities to be tempted out of your habits-in-progress, Clear told \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\" in a Jan. 8 episode.\"When you look at people who exhibit high levels of self-control, the common pattern across them is not that they have higher discipline than the average person,\" he said. \"The common pattern is that they are in situations where they're tempted less frequently.\"If you're avoiding alcohol while doing Dry January for the first time, for example, you may not want to go to happy hour with your friends, where external pressures or fear of missing out could sway you. The goal is to stay away from temptation, not resist it.\"You don't need to try to be more disciplined. You don't need to wish that you were a person with more willpower,\" said Clear. \"You need to take a little bit of time to design an environment where you're not tempted as frequently ... That could mean simple things like not having chips in the house or not having cigarettes in the house or things like that.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsYour environment can include the people you surround yourself with: Keeping company with likeminded individuals can help you stay focused, some studies show. If you and your friends are regularly in situations that keep you from building your desired habit, you might want to speak transparently with them about your goals or find other ways to spend time with them, Clear recommended.\"And that's not necessarily saying I never see these people again, but maybe I only see them in pockets or in certain situations,\" Clear said. \"And then other people I'm trying to expose myself to more and hang out with more.\"You may be inclined to tell yourself that, if you mess up during your pursuit for better habits, you should just quit trying altogether. Instead, flip your self-talk to be more optimistic, Clear advised. Tell yourself that your efforts today will pay off down the line, for example, or that you can stay the course even if you slip up.A positive attitude can also help you better manage the stress that comes with lifestyle and habit changes, according to a 2023 report from the Mayo Clinic. \"A bad attitude and self-pity makes every problem harder,\" said Clear. \"And so you're just layering on another challenge to the already challenging situation. It just does not serve you.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump walks as workers react at U.S. Steel Corporation–Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, U.S., May 30, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has appointed two Department of Commerce officials to oversee U.S. Steel under the golden share agreement reached with Japan's Nippon, according to a letter posted Monday in the Federal Register. Trump approved U.S. Steel's controversial acquisition by Nippon in June after securing veto rights over key business decisions under a golden share arrangement. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange that same month after the acquisition was completed. Trump holds the veto powers covered by the golden share as U.S. president, but he can also designate someone else to wield those authorities as his representative if he wants. The president appointed William Kimmitt, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as his designee in a letter to U.S. Steel.\"I, President Donald J. Trump, hold the Class G Preferred Stock (Golden Share) in U.S. Steel, pursuant to the National Security Agreement (Agreement) between the United States Government, Nippon Steel Corporation, and U.S. Steel,\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 letter to U.S. Steel executive Scot Duncan.\"The Golden Share provides the President with the ability to oversee U.S. Steel's activities and to ensure the company continues operating its United States-based production facilities,\" Trump said. The golden share allows Trump or his designee to veto decisions that include changing U.S. Steel's name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh, relocating the company outside the U.S., or closing production facilities.  Trump also appointed David Shapiro, a chief counsel at Commerce, as a director on U.S. Steel's board representing the U.S. government, according to the letter. The golden share goes to future U.S. presidents or their designee after Trump leaves office. ",

    "body": "A Broadcom circuit board for chip testing is pictured during a lab tour as Broadcom prepares to launch new optical chip tech to fend off Nvidia in San Jose, California, U.S., September 5, 2025.  Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom shares rallied 11.1% on Monday, making it the S&P 500's top performer of the day, as investors poured back into several high-flying tech companies tied to the artificial intelligence trade. Wall Street is also taking notice of the chipmaker as a derivate play of Alphabet's growing AI dominance. Broadcom — one of the biggest suppliers of high-performance, application-specific chips, or ASICs, for hyperscalers — has been on a tear this year, rallying 60% year to date. Monday's rally saw Broadcom notch its best day since April 9. The stock was also the best performer in the Technology Select Sector SPDR fund (XLK), which tracks the S&P 500 tech sector. The move in Broadcom comes as investors continue to push shares of Google-parent Alphabet higher. The stock rose more than 5% as the artificial intelligence trade regained some of the recently lost ground. The two are related through ASICs: Google is a major customer of Broadcom's ASIC business, as Broadcom helps design and manufacture Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). These are Google's in-house specialized AI chips, used for the company's internal AI infrastructure. Google TPUs are considered a competitor to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI workloads. Analysts have recently lifted their outlooks on Broadcom on enthusiasm about its relationship with Alphabet. Melius Research's Ben Reitzes last month reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom and lifted his price target on the stock by $60 to $475, which suggests 39.6% potential upside from Friday's close.\"Google and its partner, Broadcom, have been at it together with this custom ASIC since 2016, now in its 7th generation. Outside of the Nvidia GPU for AI workloads, the TPU is the most proven ASIC out there — and now it has the most tangible momentum. The decision to develop this product early is now starting to inflect to the upside — delivering for both Broadcom's AI revenues and Google Cloud (GCP) growth,\" Reitzes wrote in an Oct. 27 note to clients.\"While good for Alphabet, it may turn out to be even better for Broadcom, who could have huge upside to its AI revenues with Alphabet and a host of other partners who want a piece of this design expertise,\" he continued, adding that the \"TPU is rapidly becoming a larger part of Alphabet's growth strategy.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBroadcom stock performance over the past year.Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis, who has the highest price target among analysts on Broadcom, per LSEG, named the stock a top pick earlier this month and said that ASICs are hitting an \"inflection point\" as Google's need for custom chips continues to grow.\"Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27,\" Curtis wrote in a Nov. 3 note. \"Google continues to see the amount of tokens they process per month rise and announced 1,300T in October up from 480T in April 2025. This should grow even more as compute is needed for multimodal models.\"Curtis has a buy rating on shares and lifted his price target by $65 to $480. That implies the stock could jump another 41%.Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research, told CNBC he is very bullish on Broadcom and Alphabet. Ives owns both stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (IVES).\"Broadcom and Alphabet are the new AI plays the market is rediscovering the massive market for ASIC chips with Google leading the charge,\" he said. \"This could be the most proven ASIC chip in the market and the AI Revolution is still early days ... it's been a historic quick turnaround to the very bullish Street sentiment today.Alphabet shares are up 21% over the past month, outperforming its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers and propelling the broader market higher in recent trading sessions. Investors have reacted positively to Google's latest AI model Gemini 3, its upcoming seventh-generation TPU called \"Ironwood,\" its advancements in AI image generation with Nano Banana Pro and its new agent platform called \"Google Antigravity.\"  ",

The guides include top products, key differences between the products and the latest information from retailers, according to a blog. Users will be able to tailor their guides based on their budget, what features they care about and who they are shopping for. OpenAI said it will take a couple of minutes to generate answers with shopping research, so users who are looking for simple answers like a price check can still rely on a regular ChatGPT response.When users submit prompts to ChatGPT that say things like, \"Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" or \"I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art,\" they will see the shopping research tool pop up automatically, OpenAI said. The tool can also be accessed from the menu. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months. The company introduced a feature called Instant Checkout in September that allows users to make purchases directly from eligible merchants through ChatGPT. Shopping research users will be able to make purchases with Instant Checkout in the future, OpenAI said on Monday. OpenAI said its shopping research results are organic and based on publicly available retail websites, and that it will not share users' chats with retailers. It's possible that shopping research will make mistakes around product availability and pricing, the company said.Shopping research is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Go, Plus and Pro users who are logged in to ChatGPT.WATCH: OpenAI taps Foxconn to build AI hardware in the U.S.watch now",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence.\"The Big Short\" investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he's built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. 'I doubted if I ever should come back. I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he contends history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

    "body": "Your Hometown Deli in Paulsboro, N.J.Google EarthThat's one big deli bill to skip out of paying.A federal judge is hotter than a newly brewed pot of coffee over the failure of Peter Coker Sr. and his son, Peter Coker Jr., to pay millions of dollars in restitution for their leading roles in the notorious $100 million New Jersey deli stock fraud.The Coker convicts owe a total of $5.56 million to victims of their scam, which involved illegally inflating the stock prices of two publicly traded companies to make them attractive candidates for mergers.The scheme led to one of the companies, then-known as Hometown International, having a market capitalization of more than $100 million despite owning only one small, money-losing delicatessen in the hardscrabble south Jersey town of Paulsboro. Shares of the other company, then known as E-Waste, were worth even more on paper at one point despite owning no appreciable assets. Judge Christine O'Hearn, in a scathing order about the Cokers on Monday, said, \"It appears ... that, despite having substantial liquid assets at the time the sentence was imposed, neither Defendant has complied with the restitution deadlines set by the Court.\"\"It appears to the Court that Defendants have purposefully failed to make payment, perhaps in an effort to avoid doing so and/or dissipating or transferring assets,\" O'Hearn wrote in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.Peter Coker Sr. and his wife Susan Coker at U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, March 15, 2023.Dan Mangan | CNBCPeter Coker Sr., who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, owed his first installment of $2.5 million in restitution within 30 days of Aug. 11, according to an order by O'Hearn in August. Coker Jr., a businessman who previously lived in Hong Kong, owed his first installment of $1.5 million within 30 days of the same date.The Cokers and a third defendant who pleaded guilty in the case, James Patten, are jointly liable for the $5.56 million in total restitution. Patten has yet to be sentenced; because of that, he is not currently required to start paying restitution.Retail investors are owed $178,849 in total restitution. And investment arms of Duke and Vanderbilt universities are owed $3.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in restitution.In her Monday order, O'Hearn demanded answers from prosecutors and the Cokers' lawyers within two weeks on questions related to the failure to pay restitution so far.The judge told them \"to take all necessary steps forthwith to secure payment of the restitution amounts previously ordered.\"One potential hurdle to getting money from Peter Coker Jr. is the fact that the 57-year-old is no longer in prison — or even the United States. Coker Jr. renounced his U.S. citizenship years ago.On Oct. 16, a day after his release from prison, he was deported to the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, where he has citizenship, according to a letter to O'Hearn from his lawyer.Peter Coker Jr., left, is issued search warrants from police at his villa on the southern resort island of Phuket, Thailand, Jan. 11, 2023.Crime Suppression Division, Royal Thai Police | APHis father, Peter Coker Sr., 83, is slated to be released on Dec. 8 from a residential reentry facility in North Carolina maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, having been released from a prison in Butner, North Carolina, on Tuesday.Coker Sr.'s lawyer, Zach Intrater, in a letter last week to O'Hearn, disputed the idea that he owed any payments toward restitution while he was still locked up in prison.Intrater, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, in that letter said that \"Mr. Coker, Sr., is not looking to avoid his responsibilities under the amended judgment,\" and that he \"will begin making the required payments toward restitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

In May, O'Hearn sentenced the elder Coker to six months in jail, and Coker Jr. to 40 months in prison. The younger Coker was released last month because he received credit for the more than two years he spent locked up in a New Jersey jail before his sentencing.John Azzarello, a lawyer for Coker Jr., in a letter to the judge on Thursday, said his representation of Coker Jr. ended with his sentencing, that he has no contact with the fraudster since his sentencing, and \"we do not know Mr. Coker Jr.'s current whereabouts.\"\"Mr. Coker Jr. also has an outstanding invoice for legal services rendered which remains unpaid to date,\" Azzarello wrote.

Joe Skipper | ReutersAmazon said Monday it will begin allowing businesses to test its recently rebranded internet-from-space service that seeks to compete with SpaceX's Starlink.Select businesses will be able to test Amazon Leo production hardware and software as part of an \"enterprise preview\" of the service \"ahead of a wider rollout,\" the company said in a blog post. The test program will allow Amazon to collect feedback and \"tailor solutions for specific industries\" ahead of a broader launch, the company said. Earlier this month, Amazon renamed its satellite internet offering from Project Kuiper to Amazon Leo and rolled out a new website to market the service. The name is a nod to low Earth orbit, a region of space that's within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface and where Amazon's satellite constellation will be concentrated. Six years ago, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX. It's aiming to compete with Starlink, owned by SpaceX, which currently dominates the market and has nearly 9,000 satellites in orbit.Amazon has inked deals with JetBlue, L3Harris and Australia's NBN internet network, among others. Amazon said it's shipping units of its \"Pro\" terminals, as well as its \"Ultra\" antennas, to members of its enterprise preview program. The company on Monday showed off the final production design of its Ultra model, which will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds up to 400 megabits per second powered by an in-house custom silicon chip, \"making it the fastest commercial phased array antenna in production.\"Amazon said it expects to expand the program to more customers as it adds coverage and capacity to the Leo network.  The company has yet to disclose pricing and availability for consumers.

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., talks with reporters in Dirksen building on Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon on Monday said that it was reviewing what it called \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona for making a video with five other Democratic lawmakers that urged members of the military to refuse to follow illegal orders.The Pentagon said Kelly, who is a retired U.S. Navy captain, might be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial on the allegations.President Donald Trump last week called Kelly and the other Democrats \"traitors,\" and said their statements on the video were \"seditious behavior at the highest level.\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a statement on X on Monday, said, \"The video made by the 'Seditious Six' was despicable, reckless, and false.\"\"Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline,'\" said Hegseth.\"Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction,\" Hegseth wrote. \"However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ — and he knows that.\" UCMJ is the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Pentagon, in its own social media statement, said that a \"thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"\"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,\" the Pentagon said.Kelly, in a response on X, said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death.\"\"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly wrote.\"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen. Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly had said, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democrats who underscored that same message on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Dekluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer, but all three of them separated from those service branches rather than retired from them. Because they did not retire from those branches, they are not subject to the UCMJ, as Kelly is.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Thursday, said, \"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\"\"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country  anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET.\"The Pentagon, in its statement Monday, said, \"The Department of War reminds all individuals that military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces.\"\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful,\" the statement said.\"A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"Greg Lukianoff, CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, an advocacy group, in a statement said, \"The Pentagon's actions are clear retaliation for something Sen. Kelly is entirely within his rights to say.\"\"America's servicemembers already take an oath to uphold the Constitution, which includes not following illegal orders,\" Lukianoff said. \"The argument that the video's message is sedition, or otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment, is flatly wrong.\"",

Lee granted a temporary restraining order on Monday, blocking OpenAI from using the \"cameo\" mark or similar words like \"Kameo\" or \"CameoVideo\" for any function related to Sora, the company's AI-generated video app.\"We disagree with the complaint's assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word 'cameo', and we look forward to continuing to make our case to the court,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC. Lee granted the order after OpenAI was sued in October by Cameo, a platform that allows users to purchase personalized videos from celebrities. Cameo filed a trademark lawsuit against the artificial intelligence company following the launch of Sora's \"Cameo\" feature, which allowed users to generate characters of themselves or others and insert them into videos.\"We are gratified by the court's decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,\" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. \"While the court's order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.\"The order is set to expire on Dec. 22, and a hearing for whether the halt should be made permanent is scheduled for Dec. 19. watch now",

Jim Justice holds up his dog Babydog as he comes to the end of his State of the State speech in the House chambers, at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, W.Va., Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022.Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette | APThe U.S. government on Monday sued Sen. Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican, and his wife for $5.1 million in unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest dating to the 2009 tax filing year.\"Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments ...James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States,\" the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, alleged.The lawsuit, filed by the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, asks a judge to enter a judgment in favor of the U.S. against the couple in the amount of $5,164,739.75, which was the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service as of Aug. 4, according to the filing.The suit was filed nearly two months after the IRS reportedly filed notices of a tax lien for $8 million against Justice in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. One of the notices referenced a tax assessment dated Nov. 25, 2015 — the same date as the assessment referenced in the lawsuit filed Monday.Politico, which broke the news of the tax lien on Oct. 10, noted then that the IRS website says \"generally the IRS can pursue collection of a tax liability up to 10 years from the date it was  assessed. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed any time within that 10-year period.\"Tuesday is the end of a 10-year period that would have began on Nov. 25, 2015.Justice was elected to the Senate in November 2024, replacing Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent who quit the Democratic caucus earlier that year.

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday morning, a White House official confirmed to CNBC.Specifics about the call, including why it was scheduled or who requested it, were not immediately clear. The White House did not provide details about what was discussed, but Trump on Monday later confirmed the call in a post on Truth Social.\"We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc. We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers — and it will only get better,\" Trump wrote. \"Our relationship with China is extremely strong!\"He also noted that the two leaders had agreed to reciprocal in-person meetings. The first will be a meeting in Beijing in April. A state visit in the U.S. will be scheduled later in the year, Trump wrote. \"We agreed that it is important that we communicate often, which I look forward to doing,\" Trump wrote.Earlier, China's Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement said, \"The two sides are implementing all elements of what we agreed to\" when the two leaders met in Busan, South Korea, late last month.That consensus involved the United States agreeing to lower tariffs on Chinese goods, and China agreeing to pause new export controls on rare earth minerals, among other stipulations that lowered the temperature in their ongoing trade war.\"The China-U.S. relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory\" since the Busan meeting, Beijing said in the statement on Monday, which was translated by NBC News.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Sandisk will replace marketing company Interpublic, which is being acquired by Omnicom, S&P Global said in a statement. It's the latest tech company to join the S&P 500, which gets an increasing amount of its value from internet, software and semiconductor businesses. AppLovin, Datadog, DoorDash and Robinhood became members of the index earlier this year.Stocks tend to rally when they're added to the benchmark as fund managers who track the S&P 500 need to buy shares to reflect the changes. Western Digital bought Sandisk in 2016 for $15.6 billion. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of about $33 billion.Sandisk sells fast storage drives for gaming PCs, digital cameras and security cameras, and is also trying to land deals with large-scale data center builders. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 23% to $2.31 billion. The company reported a 31% increase in exabytes sold. Omnicom announced plans to acquire Interpublic in December, and on Monday said the deal received antitrust approval from the European Commission.WATCH: WDC CEO: SanDisk deal great for shareholderswatch now",

    "body": "A Tesla logo outside the company's Tilburg Factory and Delivery Center.Karol Serewis | Getty ImagesTesla is trying to get its \"FSD Supervised\" technology approved for use in the Netherlands. But Dutch regulators are telling Tesla fans to stop pressuring safety authority RDW on the matter, and that their efforts will have \"no influence\" on the ultimate decision. The RDW issued a statement on Monday directed at those who have been sending messages to try and get the  agency to clear Tesla's premium partially automated driving system, marketed in the U.S. as the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) option. It's not yet available for use in the Netherlands or Europe broadly. \"We thank everyone who has already done so and would like to ask everyone not to contact us about this,\" the agency said. \"It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service. Moreover, this will have no influence on whether or not the planning is met. Road safety is the RDW's top priority: admission is only possible once the safety of the system has been convincingly demonstrated.\"The regulator said it will make a decision only after Elon Musk's company shows that the technology meets the country's stringent vehicle safety standards. The RDW has booked a schedule allowing Tesla to demonstrate its systems, and said it could decide on authorization as early as February. Last week, Tesla posted on X encouraging its followers to contact RDW to express their wishes to have the systems approved. The post claimed, \"RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026,\" adding a message to \"please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible.\" Tesla said other EU countries could then follow suit. The RDW corrected Tesla on Monday, saying in a statement on its official website, that such approval is not guaranteed and had not been promised. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Tesla's FSD-equipped vehicles in October following reports of widespread traffic violations tied to use of the systems.The cars Tesla sells today, even with FSD Supervised engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.For years, Musk has promised that Tesla customers would soon be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or supervisors on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed. Musk has said the company aims to remove human driers in Austin, Texas, by the end of 2025. WATCH: Tesla bear on company's EV businesswatch now",

Grogan | CNBCOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on Friday that the artificial intelligence startup has finally finished its first prototypes for hardware devices.\"Finally, we have the first prototypes,\" Altman said in a video posted Monday by Emerson Collective, which invests in entrepreneurs. \"I can't believe how jaw dropping good the work is and how exciting it is.\"Altman was speaking in an on-stage discussion with former Apple design chief Jony Ive and Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of the late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs and president and founder of Emerson Collective. In May, OpenAI acquired Ive's startup, called io, for $6.4 billion in equity and announced that it would make new AI devices. Ive took on design responsibilities on the hardware project. Since then, OpenAI and io have been relatively quiet about the project. Ive said he expects to reveal the device in two years or less. He said that much of the development process for new hardware is unpredictable.\"Especially in large companies that value predictability, leaders get really uncomfortable with ambiguity,\" Ive said. Altman declined to answer a question about what exactly OpenAI is building, but said the company is targeting a calmer \"vibe\" with its hardware versus smartphones, which he compared to walking through Times Square.\"You can then go for a vibe that is not like walking through Times Square and getting bumped into and having all this stuff compete for your attention,\" Altman said. \"But, like, sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\"He said a smart AI device will be able to do things for the user over long periods of time, filter things out and understand when something is important enough to notify the user. Altman added that the device will be able to \"know everything you've ever thought about, read, said.\"OpenAI's hardware plans are being closely watched by rivals and potential customers alike. Companies including Amazon, Google, and Meta have released AI-oriented devices like smart glasses and speakers, but none has been a big enough hit to reshape the hardware industry. Startups are also experimenting with new device sizes like pendants and ideas like giving AI bots a personality. A major device launch from OpenAI, which has the most used chatbot with ChatGPT, could break the stalemate, and a successful product could eventually threaten Apple. The iPhone maker has yet to release an AI specific design, and the company has run into issues with rolling out improvements to Siri, its long-standing AI voice assistant. In March, Apple announced that it was delaying Siri improvements to 2026. Last week, OpenAI said it entered into an agreement with Foxconn, which manufactures many consumer electronics, including for Apple. However, the OpenAI deal with Foxconn is focused on building AI infrastructure, and the companies didn't mention device manufacturing.

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.Chesnot | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Monday announced Claude Opus 4.5, its latest artificial intelligence model that the startup says excels at coding, using computers and assisting users with complex enterprise tasks. Claude Opus 4.5 marks Anthropic's third major model launch in two months, and it serves as the latest example of the nonstop pace of development within the AI industry. The startup unveiled its Claude Sonnet 4.5 model in late September, followed by its Claude Haiku 4.5 model in October. \"The amount that we're releasing to the market and the feedback loops that we're generating from it just make me so unbelievably excited,\" Scott White, product leader for Claude.ai at Anthropic, told CNBC in an interview.Anthropic is an AI startup that was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021. Microsoft and Nvidia announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic last week, boosting the AI lab's valuation to about $350 billion. The company is best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. It assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsized model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku. The last Opus model, which Anthropic released in August, was called Claude Opus 4.1. Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ dealThe ideal users for Claude Opus 4.5 will be professional software developers and knowledge workers like financial analysts, consultants and accountants, White said. People who are \"excited to push their own creativity, build new things, expand their professional purview\" will also find the model useful, White added. The new model is \"meaningfully better\" at everyday tasks like working with spreadsheets and slides and conducting deep research, Anthropic said in a blog.Claude Opus 4.5 is also state-of-the-art for agentic coding, outperforming rival models like Google's Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced last week, and OpenAI's GPT-5.1, according to SWE-bench Verified, a test set that measures an AI system's software coding abilities. Anthropic said it tested Claude Opus 4.5 on a difficult take-home exam that it gives to prospective performance engineers, and the model scored higher than any human candidate ever had. Claude Opus 4.5 will be available everywhere, and it will be the default model for Anthropic's Pro, Max and Enterprise offerings.In addition to the model launch, Anthropic announced several other product and feature updates on Monday. Claude for Chrome, the startup's extension that allows Claude to take action across browser tabs, is expanding to all Max users, the company said. Claude for Excel, which can understand and edit spreadsheets, is now generally available to all Max, Team and Enterprise users.Anthropic is also bringing Claude Code to its desktop app and adding new capabilities to its developer platform. WATCH: Anthropic valued in range of $350B following investment deal with Microsoft, Nvidiawatch now",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersAmazon said Monday it will invest as much as $50 billion to expand its capacity to provide artificial intelligence and high-performance computing capabilities for its cloud unit's U.S. government customers.The project is slated to break ground in 2026 and will add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of capacity through new data centers designed for federal agencies, the company said in a blog. As part of the investment, agencies will have access to Amazon Web Services' AI tools, Anthropic's Claude family of models and Nvidia chips as well as Amazon's custom Trainium AI chips.The move follows similar announcements from Anthropic and Meta to expand AI data centers in the U.S. Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank announced their Stargate joint venture in January, which aims to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. AWS said the project will enable agencies to develop custom AI solutions, optimize datasets and \"enhance workforce productivity.\" AWS serves more than 11,000 government agencies, Amazon said Monday. \"This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman said in a statement.Tech companies have earmarked billions of dollars in a race to build out enough capacity to power AI services. Amazon in October boosted its forecast for capital expenditures this year, saying it now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025, up from an earlier estimate of $118 billion.WATCH: Breaking down all the top AI chipswatch now",

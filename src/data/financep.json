    "body": "Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSpotify is officially bringing video podcasts to Netflix.The partnership will bring a selection of podcasts from The Ringer, a network acquired by Spotify in 2020, to the streaming company in early 2026 for U.S. users.The podcasts will range from sports to culture to true crime, aiming to both complement Netflix's current slate and bring in new audiences, pulling from The Ringer's lineup. The companies said more markets outside of the U.S. are in the pipeline.\"This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\" Spotify's Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller said in a statement. \"Together with Netflix, we're expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences, and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.\"Lauren Smith, Netflix's vice president of content licensing and programming strategy, said the curated selection \"adds fresh voices and new perspectives to Netflix.\"The shows coming to Netflix include \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables\" and \"Serial Killers,\" with more expected after the initial launch.Spotify said the move is the next step in evolving the company into a multimedia experience, with more initiatives planned in the future to \"bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators.\"Tuesday's announcement comes as media companies have turned to video podcasts as the next big thing among their audiences. In particular, video podcasts have soared in popularity on Google's YouTube, which is increasingly nabbing a bigger share of viewership.This has led traditional media and streaming companies to lean into the medium.At this year's Upfront advertising presentations, some companies, including Amazon's Prime Video, noted the recent success of podcast content as creators sign multimillion dollar deals and garner millions of followers and views.On an April earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is \"constantly looking at all different types of content.\" Sarandos added that the line between podcasts and talk shows is becoming increasingly blurred. \"We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love,\" Sarandos said. \"Podcasts ... have become a lot more video-forward.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

Zhi faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the charges.He was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which prosecutors said grew \"in secret .... into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations.\" The Prince Group allegedly operates 10 scam compounds in Cambodia.The Treasury Department, in parallel action on Tuesday, designated Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization and announced sanctions against the Zhi and more than 100 associated individuals and entities, for their roles in alleged illicit activity.Chart of The Prince Group Transnational Criminal OrganizationU.S. Treasury DepartmentBrooklyn U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella said that Zhi \"directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions.\"\"Prince Group's investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world, including here in New York, on the backs of individuals who have been trafficked and forced to work against their will,\" Nocella said.The Prince Group, which operates businesses in more than 30 countries, ran \"forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a press release.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New York\"Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as 'pig butchering' scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world,\" the release said.The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office.\"In reality, the funds were stolen from the victims and laundered for the benefit of the perpetrators,\" the release said. \"The scam perpetrators often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds.\"Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, \"often under the threat of violence.\"Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.",

    "body": "A new Jeep Wrangler 4-Door Sahara 4x4 vehicle displayed for sale at a Stellantis NV dealership in Miami, Florida, US, on Saturday, April 5, 2025.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and other auto brands, plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years, as the company executes a domestic turnaround under CEO Antonio Filosa.The trans-Atlantic automaker on Tuesday said the investments will add more than 5,000 jobs to its domestic workforce and increase domestic production by 50%. The plans include bringing new vehicles to plants in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio through 2029.U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis rose more than 5% in after-hours trading Tuesday. The company's stock is off 24% this year.The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump's efforts to create more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. through the use of aggressive tariffs, especially for the automotive industry. The company said the plans expand those Stellantis Chair John Elkann detailed to Trump in January.\"Since day one, me and the team set out a clear priority that was to grow in the largest market that we operate, which is the U.S.,\" Filosa, who led the company's North American operations before starting as CEO on June 23, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"We know what we need to do to grow this market.\"Incoming Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, head of the company's Americas operations, greets a Windsor Assembly Plant employee during an event celebrating Chrysler’s 100th anniversary on June 6, 2025.StellantisThe company's U.S. sales peaked in 2018, when it was known as Fiat Chrysler, at more than 2.2 million vehicles. Sales last year were down 42% since then as the company and its former CEO Carlos Tavares, who was ousted late last year, focused on profits over volumes.Stellantis' new vehicles under the investments include a midsize truck for a plant in Toledo, Ohio; two new Jeep vehicles for a shuttered facility in Belvidere, Illinois; and a next-generation version of the Dodge Durango SUV and \"an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV\" at plants in Michigan.Other investments include research and development and supplier costs to execute the company's new product strategy, as well as additional investments in the company's U.S. powertrain hub in Kokomo, Indiana.Filosa said the investment decisions were a result of discussions with the company's new leadership team as well as stakeholders such as the company's franchised dealer network. He downplayed tariffs as a main driver for the decisions, saying automakers need to make long-term plans.It's not immediately clear how many of the investments and jobs are new or how many have been previously announced as part of the company's 2023 contract with the United Auto Workers union that included $18.9 billion in new investments by April 2028.But there are some differences. For example, a midsize truck was previously planned for Stellantis' Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois through a $1.5 billion investment. That vehicle, or a different midsize truck, is now expected to be added to the company's plant in Toledo through a $400 million investment.The investments cover most of the company's main U.S. manufacturing plants. Stellantis' U.S. footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centers and research and development locations across 14 states. The operations employ more than 48,000 people, according to the company.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday.\"A lot depends on what the Chinese do,\" Greer told CNBC in an interview. \"They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation.\"China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented.Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week,  saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.\"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains,\" the U.S. trade representative said.Trump, Xi scheduled to meetThe restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.\"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese,\" Greer said of the meeting. \"But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can.\"U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.\"We think we'll be able to work through it,\" Greer said of the trade dispute.'We want to work with the Chinese'The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.\"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information,\" Greer said. \"You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese.\"Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. air traffic controllers have received partial paychecks, their union said Tuesday, and they could miss their next paychecks altogether if the government shutdown lasts another two weeks.\"The job is stressful enough as it is. Now you're adding this factor of, 'Hey, when am I going to get this next paycheck?'\" said Raymond Dahlstrom, an air traffic controller.Dahlstrom and some of his colleagues handed out leaflets outside of LaGuardia Airport in New York on Tuesday to urge the public to ask lawmakers to end the shutdown. Air traffic controllers were also scheduled to hand out informational pamphlets at other airports in Washington, D.C., and Chicago on Tuesday.The government shut down on Oct. 1, as the Senate has failed to pass a bill to fund the government.

He said some controllers are taking second jobs like driving for ride-hailing companies to help make ends meet while they're going without pay.A more-than-monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Even outside of the shutdown, the U.S. has been dealing with a shortage of trained air traffic controllers, which has periodically disrupted flights. Airline executives have pushed for more training initiatives and more modern technology for years.But the government shutdown has also put additional focus on U.S. aviation.Some airports including Las Vegas, the three major New York City airports and others are refusing to air a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames the shutdown on Democrats, airport officials told CNBC on Tuesday.",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdult ChatGPT users can soon access a less censored version of the artificial intelligence chatbot, which will include erotic materials, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced in an apparent policy shift.\"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" Altman said in a social media post on Tuesday. Though it remains unclear what material will qualify as permitted erotica, the move could represent a major shift in OpenAI's policy, which formerly prohibited such content in most contexts.According to Altman, existing versions of ChatGPT were made \"pretty restrictive\" to protect users from mental health risks, but that approach made the chatbot \"less useful [and enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems. \"Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,\" he said.Those \"new tools\" appear to refer to safety features and parental controls rolled out last month to address concerns over how the chatbot was impacting young users' mental health. watch nowHowever, as safeguards for minors expand, it appears that Altman is ready for ChatGPT to take a looser approach for adults. OpenAI hinted at a shift in February when language on its \"Model Spec\" page was updated to clarify that, in order to \"maximize freedom\" for users, only sexual content involving minors was prohibited. Still, erotica was considered to be \"sensitive content\" to be generated only in certain permitted contexts.Besides the rollout in December, Altman also said a new version of ChatGPT will launch in the coming weeks, allowing the chatbot to adopt more distinct personalities — building on updates in the latest GPT‑4o version.\"If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it,\" he said. \"But only if you want it.\"Growth vs. safety After Altman's post on Tuesday, some social media users were quick to point out his previous statements suggesting that ChatGPT wouldn't implement sexualized chat features, unlike rival models such as xAI's Grok. In an August interview, independent tech journalist Cleo Abram asked Altman to give an example of a decision he had made that was best for the world, but not for winning the AI race. \"Well, we haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet,\" Altman said in an apparent nod to provocative AI companions released by Elon Musk's xAI. Altman's policy shift comes at a notable time for OpenAI, as it already faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices. In September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over potential risks to children and teenagers.That followed a lawsuit from a California couple who alleged that ChatGPT contributed to their 16-year-old son's suicide.OpenAI on Tuesday also announced an eight-member expert council on well-being and AI to advise the company on how artificial intelligence affects users' mental health, emotions and motivation. The council will guide OpenAI in defining what healthy AI interactions look like through check-ins and recurring meetings, the company said.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, and provided a few hints that more interest rate cuts are in the cards.Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with \"quantitative tightening,\" or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet.While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications the Fed is nearing its goal of \"ample\" reserves available for banks.\"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,\" Powell said in prepared remarks. \"We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.\"On interest rates, the central bank chief did not provide specific guidance on a path lower, but comments about weakness in the labor market indicated that easing is firmly on the table, as financial markets expect.\"If we move too quickly, then we may leave the inflation job unfinished and have to come back later and finish it. If we move too slowly, there may be unnecessary losses, painful losses, in the employment market. So we're in the difficult situation of balancing those two things,\" he said.\"The data we got right after the July meeting showed that ... that the labor market has actually softened pretty considerably, and puts us in a situation where the two risks are closer to being in balance,\" Powell added.Other Fed officials have said recently that the falling labor market is taking precedence in their thinking, leading to the likelihood of additional rate cuts ahead.Balance sheet mathPowell, though, centered most of his speech on the Fed's holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets.When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for \"abundant\" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for \"ample\" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system.During the Covid pandemic, the central bank had aggressively purchased Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the balance sheet to close to $9 trillion.Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. The question had been how far the Fed needed to go, and Powell's comments indicate that the end is close.He noted that \"some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening\" and could be signaling that reducing reserves further would hinder growth. However, he also said the Fed has no plans to go back to its pre-Covid balance sheet size, which was closer to $4 trillion.On a related matter, Powell noted concerns over the Fed continuing to pay interest on bank reserves.The Fed normally remits interest it earns from its holdings to the Treasury general fund. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have suggested terminating the payments on reserves.However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy.\"While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history,\" he said. \"If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates.\"Views on the economyOn the larger issue of interest rates, Powell generally stuck to the recent script, namely that policymakers are concerned that the labor market is tightening and skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation.\"While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation,\" he said. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\"Powell noted that the Federal Open Market Committee responded in September to the situation with a quarter percentage point reduction on the federal funds rate. While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal.\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" he said.The Fed has been hampered somewhat by the government shutdown and the impact it has had on economic data releases. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions.Powell said the Fed is continuing to analyze conditions based on the data that is available.\"Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,\" Powell said. \"Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week.Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.",

    "body": "watch nowChina's sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports threaten the U.S. defense industry, providing President Xi Jinping with powerful leverage over President Donald Trump in upcoming trade talks.Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"What this essentially means is that it will deny licenses to foreign militaries and companies that are producing military use end goods,\" Baskaran told CNBC. \"It undermines the development of the defense industrial base at a time when there is rising global tension. It is a very powerful negotiating tactic because it undermines national security.\"Rare earth magnets are crucial components in U.S. weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Virginia and Columbia class submarines, Predator drones, Tomahawk missiles, radar, and the joint direct attack munition series of smart bombs, according to the Department of Defense.China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths. It controls 60% of mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for around 70% of its rare earth imports, according the U.S. Geological Survey.\"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve, that we let China monopolize 90% of the refining of rare earth materials,\" Jeremy Siegel, University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus of finance, told CNBC on Monday. \"Where were we?\"'Massively disruptive'Beijing also imposed broad controls that require foreign companies to obtain an export license if rare earths processed in China make up as little as 0.1% of their products' value. Firms will also need licenses for products that rely on Chinese rare earth technology for mining, smelting, separation, magnet manufacturing and recycling.\"If these rules were to be strictly and indefinitely enforced, they would be massively disruptive, not just to the US but globally,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 10 note. Rare earths are also crucial inputs for the semiconductor and automobile industries.The restrictions would impact every sector of the U.S. economy but the defense, semiconductor and electric vehicle industries would face the brunt, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, an economist at French investment bank Natixis. Defense contractors, Apple, Nvidia, Intel, Tesla, Ford and GM are all highly exposed, Hererro told clients in a Monday note.The Trump administration is working to build out a domestic supply chain. The Defense Department struck an unprecedented deal with the largest U.S. rare earth miner MP Materials in July that included an equity stake, price floors and an offtake agreement.\"This will certainly also further accelerate US efforts to develop our own rare earth resources,\" Marcus said. U.S. rare earth stocks have surged as investors speculate that the Trump administration will strike deals with other miners.Standoff in South KoreaThe restrictions threaten to reignite the trade war between China and the U.S. after months of relative calm.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1. The huge import taxes would come on top of the 44% tariff rate already in place on China, effectively cutting off trade between the world's two largest economies, according to Wolfe Research.\"It wouldn't take much re-escalation to get us back to the quasi-embargo situation that prevailed in the spring,\" Marcus told clients.The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value Friday after Trump threatened massive tariffs against China, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The S&P 500 rallied Monday to regain more than half of Friday's losses after Trump appeared to de-escalate, saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.Trump and Xi are still expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea, later this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Monday.The most likely scenario is \"both sides pull back on the most aggressive policies and that talks lead to a further—and possibly indefinite—extension of the tariff escalation pause reached in May,\" Goldman Sachs told clients Sunday.But Beijing's strategy is unclear and the tariff deadline is just weeks away, raising the risk that an agreement might not be struck in time, Marcus said.\"Without more conviction about Beijing's strategy here, we're concerned that they won't be willing to back down fast enough to prevent these 100% tariffs from kicking in, at least temporarily,\" the analyst said.",

    "body": "A Chevrolet Silverado EV and a Chevrolet Brightdrop, which is assembled in Canada, are seen on display at the Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February 13, 2025. Carlos Osorio | ReutersDETROIT — General Motors' third-quarter results next week will include a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated. The Detroit automaker Tuesday morning in a public filing said $1.2 billion of the impact will be noncash, special charges as a result of adjustments to its EV capacity. The other $400 million in cash is primarily related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments, according to the filing. The automaker said its reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing footprint is \"ongoing,\" signaling additional charges could be announced for future quarters.The charges will be reported as special items when GM announces its third-quarter results on Oct. 21. That means they will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings, or EBIT-adjusted, which are closely watched by Wall Street.GM was among the earliest to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that didn't culminate. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion by this year in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.The charges come amid changing regulations regarding EVs — particularly the end of $7,500 in federal tax credits — under the Trump administration as compared with President Joe Biden, who championed the vehicles. watch now\"Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,\" GM said in the filing.John Murphy, a longtime analyst with Bank of America, warned earlier this year of such write-downs for automakers that invested heavily in EVs.\"There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,\" Murphy, who's now with Haig Partners, said in June during an event for Bank of America's \"Car Wars\" report. \"Based on the study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.\"GM's EV pullback charges come more than a year after crosstown rival Ford Motor announced a $1.9 billion impact from its EV plans. Ford's included about $400 million for the write-down of manufacturing assets, as well as additional expenses and cash expenditures of up to $1.5 billion that included canceling a large, electric three-row SUV that was already far in development and delaying production of its next-generation electric full-size pickup truck.GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year in EV sales, but the size of the market is niche compared with expectations at the beginning of this decade.Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share in all-electric vehicles to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. It still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla, which was estimated to have a 43.1% market share through September.",

    "body": "watch nowSam Altman didn't set out to compete with Nvidia.OpenAI began with a simple bet that better ideas, not better infrastructure, would unlock artificial general intelligence. But that view shifted years ago, as Altman realized that more compute, or processing power, meant more capability — and ultimately, more dominance.On Monday morning, he unveiled his latest blockbuster deal, one that moves OpenAI squarely into the chipmaking business and further into competition with the hyperscalers.OpenAI is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop racks of custom AI accelerators, purpose-built for its own models. It's a big shift for a company that once believed intelligence would come from smarter algorithms, not bigger machines.\"In 2017, the thing that we found was that we were getting the best results out of scale,\" the OpenAI CEO said in a company podcast on Monday. \"It wasn't something we set out to prove. It was something we really discovered empirically because of everything else that didn't work nearly as well.\"That insight — that the key was scale, not cleverness — fundamentally reshaped OpenAI.Now, the company is expanding that logic even further, teaming up with Broadcom to design and deploy racks of custom silicon optimized for OpenAI's workloads.The deal gives OpenAI deeper control over its stack, from training frontier models to owning the infrastructure, distribution, and developer ecosystem that turns those models into lasting platforms.Altman's rapid series of deals and product launches is assembling a complete AI ecosystem, much like Apple did for smartphones and Microsoft did for PCs, with infrastructure, hardware, and developers at its core.watch nowHardwareThrough its partnership with Broadcom, OpenAI is co-developing custom AI accelerators, optimized for inference and tailored specifically to its own models.Unlike Nvidia and AMD chips, which are designed for broader commercial use, the new silicon is built for vertically integrated systems, tightly coupling compute, memory, and networking into full rack-level infrastructure. OpenAI plans to begin deploying them in late 2026.The Broadcom deal is similar to what Apple did with its M-series chips: control the semiconductors, control the experience.But OpenAI is going even further and engineering every layer of the hardware stack, not just the chip.The Broadcom systems are built on its Ethernet stack and designed to accelerate OpenAI's core workloads, giving the company a physical advantage that's deeply entangled with its software edge.At the same time, OpenAI is pushing into consumer hardware, a rare move for a model-first company.Its $6.4 billion all-stock acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, brought the legendary Apple designer into its inner circle. It was a sign that OpenAI doesn't just want to power AI experiences, it wants to own them.Ive and his team are exploring a new class of AI-native devices designed to reshape how people interact with intelligence, moving beyond screens and keyboards toward more intuitive, engaging experiences.Reports of early concepts include a screenless, wearable device that uses voice input and subtle haptics, envisioned more as an ambient companion than a traditional gadget.OpenAI's twin bet on custom silicon and emotionally resonant consumer hardware adds two more powerful branches over which it has direct control.watch nowBlockbuster dealsOpenAI's chips, datacenters and power fold into one coordinated campaign called Stargate that provides the physical backbone of AI.In the past three weeks, that campaign has gone into overdrive with several major deals:OpenAI and Nvidia have agreed to a framework for deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, backed by a proposed $100 billion investment.AMD will supply OpenAI with multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs under a 6-gigawatt deal. OpenAI can acquire up to 10% of AMD if certain deployment milestones are met.Broadcom's custom inference chips and racks are slated to begin deployment in late 2026, as part of Stargate's first 10‑gigawatt phase.Taken together, it is OpenAI's push to root the future of AI in infrastructure it can call its own.\"We are able to think from etching the transistors all the way up to the token that comes out when you ask ChatGPT a question, and design the whole system,\" Altman said. \"We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that.\"Whether or not OpenAI can deliver on every promise, the scale and speed of Stargate is already reshaping the market, adding hundreds of billions in market cap for its partners, and establishing OpenAI as the de facto market leader in AI infrastructure.None of its rivals appears able to match the pace or ambition. And that perception alone is proving a powerful advantage.DevelopersOpenAI's DevDay made it clear that the company isn't just focused on building the best models — it's betting on the people who build with them.\"OpenAI is trying to compete on several fronts,\" said Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at D.A. Davidson, pointing to its frontier model, consumer-facing chat product, and enterprise API platform. \"It is competing with some combination of all the large technology companies in one or more of these markets.\"Developer Day, he said, was aimed at helping companies incorporate OpenAI models into their own tools.\"The tools they presented were very impressive — OpenAI has been terrific at commercializing their products in a compelling and easy-to-use manner,\" he added. \"Having said that, they are fighting an uphill battle, since the companies they are competing with have significantly more resources — at least for now.\"The main competition, Luria said, is primarily Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud.Developer Day signaled just how aggressively OpenAI is leaning in.The company rolled out AgentKit for developers, new API bundles for enterprise, and a new App Store that offers direct distribution inside ChatGPT — which now reaches 800 million weekly active users, according to OpenAI.\"It's the Apple playbook: own the ecosystem and become a platform,\" said Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.watch nowUntil now, most companies treated OpenAI as a tool in their stack. But with new features for publishing, monetizing, and deploying apps directly inside ChatGPT, OpenAI is pushing for tighter integration — and making it harder for developers to walk away.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pursued a similar strategy after taking over from Steve Ballmer.To build trust with developers, Nadella leaned into open source and acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, a move that signaled Microsoft's return to the developer community.GitHub later became the launchpad for tools like Copilot, anchoring Microsoft back at the center of the modern developer stack.\"OpenAI and all the big hyperscalers are going for vertical integration,\" said Ben Van Roo, CEO of Legion Intelligence, a startup building secure agent frameworks for defense and intelligence use cases.\"Use our models and our compute, and build the next-gen agents and workflows with our tools. The market is massive. We're talking about replacing SaaS, big systems of record, and literally part of the labor force,\" said Van Roo.SaaS stands for software as a service, a group of companies specializing in enterprise software and services, of which Salesforce, Oracle and Adobe are part.Legion's strategy is to stay model-agnostic and focus on secure, interoperable agentic workflows that span multiple systems. The company is already deploying inside classified Department of Defense environments and embedding across platforms like NetSuite and Salesforce.But that same shift also introduces risk for the model makers.\"Agents and workflows make some of the massive LLMs both powerful and maybe less necessary,\" he noted. \"You can build reasoning agents with smaller and specific workflows without GPT-5.\"The tools and agents built with leading LLMs have the potential to replace legacy software products from companies like Microsoft and Salesforce.That's why OpenAI is racing to build the infrastructure around its models. It's not just to make them more powerful, but harder to replace.The real bet isn't that the best model will win, but that the company with the most complete developer loop will define the next platform era.And that's the vision for ChatGPT now: Not just a chatbot, but an operating system for AI.watch now",

    "body": "Aerial view of the Apple Data Center in Mesa near Phoenix, Arizona, U.S. on August 6, 2017. Picture taken on August 6, 2017. Apple plans to build its second data center in China at Ulanqab City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.Jim Todd | ReutersA version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.The sudden surge in demand for data is fast creating new commercial real estate sectors – not just data centers, but so-called quantum real estate and powered land.The former refers to structures designed to house specialized quantum computers. The latter is land prepared and ready for data center operations, with a focus on obtaining a reliable and sufficient power supply. That land would have to be secured with the permits, utility commitments and infrastructure needed to deliver power to a data center.There are currently about 20,000 acres of powered land sitting under operational data centers around the world. Roughly 40,000 acres of powered land, almost 2 billion square feet, are needed to support current projections for data center growth over the next five years, according to a new research paper from Hines, a global real estate investment manager. That's equivalent to just under the size of three Manhattans or about 1½ times the size of Paris.Hines, which has been developing data centers for more than 20 years, has pivoted to a new business in just the past year. It is now securing power and entitlements for hyperscale sites. What that means on the ground is mapping grids, negotiating with landowners and providing financial guarantees to grid operators, who now demand it.\"The challenge isn't building walls anymore. It's getting megawatts to the site,\" said David Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer. \"Hines is focused on this front-end work, making land AI-ready before the buildings even rise.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Steinbach said powered land has become its own investable asset class, because power rights themselves are scarce and valuable. Once grid connections and permits are secured, you've created a tradeable asset with clear demand from hyperscalers and operators, he said. The competition for powered land is being led more by tech companies and energy producers than real estate developers, but Hines clearly doesn't want to be left behind. \"The smartest capital today isn't chasing square footage — it's enabling computation,\" said Steinbach, citing the recent Nvidia deal with Intel to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers. \"Nvidia's $5 billion bet on Intel isn't just a chip deal, it's a seismic signal that AI infrastructure is the new oil.\"In August, Silver Lake, a global private equity firm focused on technology investment, along with Commonwealth Asset Management, a real estate and infrastructure investment firm, announced the launch of a powered land platform aimed at data center development. It will deploy $400 million of capital \"to assemble a global portfolio of strategically located powered land sites to address the key scarce input in meeting the escalating demand for data centers,\" according to a news release.The platform is currently operating in and targeting high-growth markets across the U.S., Canada and the U.K., where power access is becoming increasingly scarce.\"This investment represents a long-term commitment to not only meeting the immediate needs of AI-driven data center growth but also positioning the company as a leader in the future of digital infrastructure and a one-stop shop for rapidly growing developers and hyperscalers,\" said Lee Wittlinger, managing director at Silver Lake, in the release. \"Our innovative approach to land and power solutions, combined with strategic relationships with key energy partners, will enable us to meet the evolving demands of hyperscalers with a holistic, differentiated approach.\"Data center hubs will now have to expand beyond already crowded markets like northern Virginia and into power-rich regions in the Midwest and Texas. Hines' research paper points to big opportunities right now in Europe, where undersupply and growing demand could mean big potential for both developers and investors. It also highlights the Middle East as an emerging market with growing potential as governments there invest heavily in artificial intelligence, renewables and grid infrastructure.This is not to say that this new concept of powered land is without challenges, including securing the appropriate land, managing entitlement processes with local governments, and working with utility providers to obtain sufficient commitments.  \"This isn't just a tech story,\" said Steinbach. \"It's a building cycle story reshaping how and where the real estate business develops for decades to come.\"",

Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.China is committing an \"Economically Hostile Act\" by \"purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.Ending business with China on cooking oil and \"other elements of Trade\" are possible forms of \"retribution\" that Trump said he was weighing.\"As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don't need to purchase it from China,\" he wrote.China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, importing some 27 million metric tons valued at nearly $12.8 billion in 2024 alone.But amid a simmering trade war with the Trump administration, Beijing has not bought a single American soybean since May.With retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods making soybeans pricier for Chinese importers, China has been sourcing the crop instead from producers in South America.One of those suppliers is Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes on the same day that the Trump administration first pledged to bolster the country's economy with a $20 billion currency swap.Argentina President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday, hours before the U.S. leader issued his latest salvo against China.Meanwhile, China's exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total.Trump's social media post follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.The S&P 500 stock index fell immediately after Trump's post, ending the trading day in the red after a volatile session.Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to massively increase tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals. Later that day, Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1.But on Sunday, Trump appeared to soften his attack, writing, \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\"Stocks broadly rebounded on Monday.",

    "body": "Peopleimages | Istock | Getty ImagesThe government shutdown will delay a key announcement that affects millions of Social Security beneficiaries — just how much their benefit checks will increase in 2026.The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for next year will be revealed once September consumer price index data, which was slated for release on Oct. 15, is available. Due to the federal government shutdown, the CPI release has been pushed to Oct. 24.\"The Social Security Administration (SSA) will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on October 24 as well,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CNBC.com via email.The 2026 COLA for approximately 75 million Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, beneficiaries will go into effect for January payments \"without any delay due to the current government lapse in appropriation,\" the spokesperson said.Experts estimate the benefit increase may fall in the range of 2.7% to 2.8%, based on the most recent government inflation data. Such an increase would push the average retirement benefit up by about $54 per month.Those projected increases would be higher than the 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment that went into effect in 2025, as well as the average 2.6% COLA beneficiaries have seen over the past 20 years, according to The Senior Citizens League.Yet the COLA for 2026 is likely to be substantially lower than adjustments after the pandemic-era inflation spike. The highest recent COLA adjustment of 8.7% took effect in 2023, following a 5.9% increase in benefits for 2022. Both of those increases were the highest in decades at the time.The size of the Social Security increase retirees receive will depend on the size of their Medicare Part B premiums, which are typically deducted directly from benefit checks.The standard monthly Part B premium may go up by 11.6% — or $21.50 per month — to $206.50 per month from $185, according to projections from Medicare trustees. Higher earners may pay additional monthly costs, known as income-related monthly adjustment amounts, or IRMAAs.Medicare Part B premium amounts for 2026 also have yet to be announced.watch now",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg attends the UFC 320 event at T-Mobile Arena on October 04, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Chris Unger | Ufc | Getty ImagesMore than half of all ads on Meta's Instagram ran in the service's short-form video Reels product in 2025, up from 35% in 2024, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.In the U.S., Reels accounted for 46% of time spent on the Instagram app in 2025, up from 37% in 2024, according to the data that Sensor Towered showed CNBC. On the Facebook app, that figure reached 29% in 2025, up from in 2024.The shift highlights the growing role Reels plays in Meta's efforts to drive engagement and advertising revenue across its Instagram and Facebook services.Vertical video continues to be a valuable artificial intelligence play for these social media platforms. Companies like as Meta, Google's YouTube and TikTok rely on recommendation systems powered by AI that surface personalized videos designed to keep users engaged for longer periods of time.The platforms' value in AI tools comes from the ability to serve users relevant content, Neuberger Berman senior research analyst Dan Flax said.\"They're surfacing content to the user, and as they get more signals based on what the user watches ... that's helped their recommendation engines get better and you've seen it in the Reels revenue number,\" said Flax.Advertisers have followed this trend, shifting their focus towards short-form video in the past year to reach more consumers on Reels. \"Legacy services are seeing ad volume shift away, with advertisers prioritizing more Reels to meet users where they are,\" Abraham Yousef, a senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower told CNBC.But the rise of Reels has presented monetization challenges for Meta, as short-form video typically generates less revenue than Instagram's main feed. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out this trade-off during an earnings call in 2023 when Meta stopped paying creators directly for posting Reels.\"Currently, the monetization efficiency of Reels is much less than Feed,\" Zuckerberg said at the time. \"So the more that Reels grows, even though it adds engagement to the system overall, it takes some time away from Feed and we actually lose money.\" The data shows that while Reels viewership share goes up, so does all activity on the app. Instagram's daily active users are up 2% since last year, led by increased usage of Reels, according to Sensor Tower.Meta declined to comment.Analysts say the growing share of viewership on Reels can still translate into higher overall advertising revenue for Meta.\"Even as you substitute some feed at a higher monetization rate than Reels, you still are growing, in totality, the amount of advertising dollars that advertisers are spending with Meta,\" Flax said.Zuckerberg announced on an earnings call in October that Instagram and Facebook Reels had surpassed a $50 billion annual run rate. Analysts will be looking to see how that has grown when Meta reports fourth-quarter and full year results for 2025 on Jan. 28.A response to TikTokInstagram launched Reels in August 2020, as a direct response to the growing popularity of TikTok. Meta embedded the feature into Facebook the next year.Last September, Meta announced that Instagram had amassed 3 billion monthly active users, a major milestone for the photo-sharing app, which was acquired in 2012 for $1 billion.As Reels becomes a larger share of how users and advertisers interact with Meta's apps, the focus shifts to whether the format can remain dominant amid competition from TikTok and YouTube, which offers a similar short-form video product called Shorts.In December, Meta introduced an Instagram TV app that can be used on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices. The app lets users can watch Reels on their televisions.\"What Meta has done incredibly well with Reels is that they have gotten better and better with the recommendation engines,\" said Flax. \"I give Mark Zuckerberg and the Meta leadership a lot of credit for wrapping Reels effectively, and I frankly think it has a very strong outlook.\" While Meta's Reels share continues to grow year-over-year, Sensor Tower's data showed YouTube's watch time for Shorts was flat last year.Nonetheless, YouTube continues to outpace both Instagram and TikTok on mobile, with Sensor Tower estimating U.S. daily active users grew 3% in 2025. TikTok, however, still leads in time spent, with users averaging 81 minutes per day on the app, compared with 80 minutes on YouTube and 55 minutes on Instagram.As that three-way race continues, algorithm-driven vertical video has become a central battleground for how social media companies attract users, sell advertising and sustain growth.WATCH: Meta hires a banker for its AI betwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets with French President Emmanuel Macron during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, New York, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Alexander Drago | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after French President Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his \"Board of Peace\" on Gaza.When asked for a response by a reporter in Miami about Macron's stance, Trump dismissed the French leader's influence and said he would use trade penalties as leverage.\"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon,\" Trump said. \"So you know, that's all right. What I'll do is, if they feel like [being] hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join.\"Macron's five-year presidential term is due to end in May 2027, and under French law, he cannot run again for a third term.The Board of Peace is a global body endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year, established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.Invites to various world leaders to be on the board have been sent, including to Russian President Vladimir Putin, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump also reiterated his plans to control Greenland, downplaying the likelihood of resistance from Europe.\"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" he said. \"We have to have it ...They can't protect it.\"Referring to Denmark's historical claims over Greenland, Trump said the Danish leaders were \"very good people,\" but argued that a centuries-old presence did not confer ownership.\"[Just] because the boat went there 500 years ago and then left, that doesn't give you title to property.\" It was not clear what \"boat\" Trump was referring to. Denmark has held colonies in Greenland since 1721, and the island was made part of Denmark in 1953. In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland self-government, giving the territory control over all its affairs except foreign policy and defence.Trump on Friday threatened to take control of Greenland \"whether they [European lawmakers] like it or not,\" claiming that it was needed for \"world security.\"On Saturday, he also warned that the U.S. would impose tariffs of up to 25% on eight European countries, including the UK, until the U.S. controls Greenland. Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize the territory, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly said on Jan. 6 that Trump would prefer to buy Greenland.In response, European states are weighing retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

CNBC reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Powell plans to be present for oral arguments in a case that challenges Trump's power to remove governor Lisa Cook. \"I actually think that's a mistake,\" Bessent told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you're trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that's a mistake.\"Trump said in August he was firing Cook from the Fed's board on mortgage fraud allegations. Cook, however, remains in her post at the central bank. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell on multiple occasions. Bessent's comments come after Powell issued a rare video statement, disclosing he was under criminal investigation. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in the Jan. 11 statement. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Responding to Trump's comments, a U.K. government spokesman said Tuesday that \"the U.K. will never compromise on our national security.\"\"We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future,\" he added, according to comments published by BBC News.Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Sanae Takaichi, Japan's prime minister, during a news conference the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. Takaichi officially called an early election next month and promised a temporary sales tax cut on food if she wins a fresh mandate for her new coalition. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLess than half a year into office and Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, has called a snap election, dissolving the Lower House on Jan. 23 and sending voters to the polls on Feb. 8. \"I am putting my future as prime minister on this election,\" Takaichi said at a press conference Monday, according to a Google translation of her remarks in Japanese.\"I would like the people to make a direct decision on whether they can entrust the management of the nation to Sanae Takaichi.\"The move comes despite the Lower House's term running until October 2028, raising questions over why Takaichi chose to seek a fresh mandate so early.Analysts say the decision is largely aimed at capitalizing on Takichi's high approval ratings to strengthen the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition hold on parliament. While [Sanae Takaichi] is an extremely popular Prime Minister, her party is less popular and faces a united opposition following a surprise partnership between the main opposition party and the former LDP coalition partner.Sam JochimEconomist at Swiss private bank EFGTakaichi has enjoyed historically high approval ratings since taking office. Her approval rating stood at 62% in a survey published last week by public broadcaster NHK, while other polls have placed her support in the 70% range.A Japan News Network poll showed an approval rating of as high as 78.1%, while Nikkei reported 75%. By contrast, the LDP's approval rating is at 29.7%, highlighting a gap between support for the prime minister and her party.The LDP, along with its junior coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, currently holds a razor-thin majority in the Lower House. Both parties have a combined total of 230 seats in the 456-seat chamber, but 3 independents vote with the LDP, giving the ruling coalition a 1-seat majority. A stronger majority would allow Takaichi to project a firmer political mandate to foreign leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, said Sam Jochim, economist at Swiss private bank EFG. He noted that Takaichi could have a potential meeting with the U.S. president as early as March. Jochim added that Takaichi will be aiming to capitalize on her popularity before escalating tensions with China begin to weigh on public sentiment.Beijing has imposed export controls on dual-use items to Japan and advised its citizens against travel to Japan. Diplomatic relations cooled after Takaichi said in parliament on Nov. 8 that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could prompt Japan's Self-Defense Forces to intervene. Calculated or reckless?Despite Takaichi's popularity, analysts warn that voter support may not translate to gains for the LDP. Jochim said that Takaichi was \"taking a risk\" by calling this election, pointing out that \"while she is an extremely popular Prime Minister, her party is less popular and faces a united opposition following a surprise partnership between the main opposition party and the former LDP coalition partner.\"On Jan. 16, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the largest opposition party, joined with Komeito — the LDP's former coalition partner for 26 years — to create a new party called the \"Centrist Reform Alliance.\" Together, they control 172 seats in the Lower House. Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead Japan Economist at Oxford Economics, said that without Komeito's organizational support, a considerable number of LDP candidates could struggle at the ballot box.Other analysts are more optimistic. Jesper Koll, expert director at Monex Group, said Takaichi was an \"inspiration\" to both old and particularly young Japanese. Her personal appeal, rather than her economic policies, may prove decisive and drive a landslide victory, he said.\"Takaichi is the living example of a self-made woman rising to the top against all the odds — self-made, a normal working-class family background, neither money nor Brahman,\" Koll said. \"But hard work, dedication, passion, and willingness to do what is right.\"",

    "body": "Stellantis North America COO and Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during the Stellantis press conference at the Automobility LA 2024 car show at Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, November 21, 2024. Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeBessent said Trump's new tariffs on Europe regarding Greenland are a response to an emergency. \"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president ... he is able to use the economic might of the U.S. to avoid a hot war.\" Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland, the Arctic territory of Denmark, and has ratcheted up his pressure campaign for a U.S. takeover of the island in recent weeks. Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    "body": "The Tether (USDT) stablecoin logo.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAmid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. \"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,\" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  \"Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.\"Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. Not so stable? Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using \"virtually worthless\" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an \"escape valve\" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  \"This was a violent repricing driven by fear,\" Li said. \"As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.\"He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, \"they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,\" in an emergency situation, Li said. \"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,\" he added.The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.\"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,\" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of \"put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,\" Campbell said.And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. \"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,\" Campbell said.

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

The Danish Defense will continue the increased presence with exercise activities together with a number of NATO allies in and around Greenland in 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of the European Union resisting his push to annex Greenland \"too much,\" shortly after Denmark sent additional troops to the Arctic island.Speaking ahead of his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum, Trump repeated his desire to take the self-governing Danish territory. The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq. The troops are expected to take part in an a military exercise dubbed \"Arctic Endurance.\"  Danish soldiers disembark an airplane at Nuuk airport, Greenland, on January 19, 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesThe operation, which is centered on countering potential Russian activity, Reuters reported last week, rather than in response to the Trump administration, comes less than a week after several NATO allies deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a separate joint military exercise.Danish government representatives are not expected to attend the World Economic Forum this week, a WEF spokesperson confirmed, as the dispute over Greenland intensifies.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.",

    "body": "Shipping containers and gantry cranes beyond a fishing boat near the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai, China, on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's stock market rally is drawing closer regulatory scrutiny after trading activity surged to unprecedented levels, prompting officials to move to curb leverage even as many investors argue the bull run is still in its early stages.Daily turnover across the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing stock exchanges climbed to successive record highs Monday through Wednesday last week, according to Wind Information, a financial data service focused on China. Trading volume peaked at 3.99 trillion yuan ($556 billion) on Wednesday, surpassing the previous record of 3.48 trillion yuan set in October 2024.Earlier this year, the benchmark CSI 300 hit a four-year high. This comes after the index posted its best yearly gain since 2020.The surge has revived memories of past market excesses, particularly the boom-and-bust cycle of 2015, market veterans told CNBC.China's regulators have responded by tightening margin financing rules, including raising collateral requirements on new margin trades.Under the updated rules, which took effect on Monday, the margin requirement for credit purchases was lifted to 100% from 80% across the three bourses. This means that investors must now pay the entire cost of shares upfront, while keeping the trades under existing margin financing rules, effectively eliminating borrowing on new margin trades.The regulatory tightening suggests an \"overheating\" of activity and sentiment in onshore markets, said Morgan Stanley, referring to stocks traded in mainland China, or A-shares, in yuan and by domestic and approved foreign investors.The investment bank's weighted A-share Market Sentiment Activity Index surged to 91% in recent days, the first reading above the 90% threshold since September 2024, driven largely by the spike in trading volumes. Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well.Hao HongGrow Investment Group\"Regulatory tightening took place as our sentiment indicator surged to an overheated level with record high turnover,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. However, they expect added liquidity support for both A-shares and Hong Kong equities to persist through the first quarter.Foreign investors have stepped up their activity, with net inflows exceeding $50 billion in recent months, a sharp increase from previous years, according to data provided by Skybound Capital. Still, foreign participation remains small relative to the overall size and turnover of the A-share market. Domestic investors continue to drive the rally, said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Retail investors account for about 90% of daily turnover in China's onshore stock markets, according to data from HSBC. That contrasts sharply with major overseas markets, where institutions dominate trading and retail investors make up only around 20% to 25% of volumes on the New York Stock Exchange.Engineering a slower bull?The dominance of onshore capital has shaped regulators' approach to leverage. In China's equity market, leverage primarily comes from margin financing, in which investors borrow from brokers to buy shares, amplifying both gains and losses. When leverage builds in such an environment, rallies can accelerate quickly but are also more vulnerable to abrupt reversals if sentiment shifts.\"Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well,\" said Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment Group. \"So the regulators have attempted to tweak the leverage so that they could engineer a 'slow bull'.\"Other market veterans said the latest margin-financing adjustments appear to be calibrated to temper speculative excess and promote this \"slow bull\" market, rather than signaling concern about systemic risk.\"The situation is better described as 'structural overheating,' concentrated in specific sectors such as AI-related and technology stocks, many of which are recent listings that have attracted intense speculative interest.\"Shou also pointed to the growing divergence across China's exchanges as evidence that enthusiasm remains selective. The ChiNext board has surged nearly 50% over the past six months, far outpacing the more modest gains in the Shanghai Composite Index.",

    "body": "BEIJING, CHINA - JANUARY 06: The People's Bank of China (PBOC) building is seen on January 6, 2025 in Beijing, China. Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's central bank kept its loan prime rates unchanged on Tuesday as the authorities focus on targeted support for specific sectors to bolster a slowing economy instead of broad policy easing.  The People's Bank of China held its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates at 3% and 3.5%, respectively, keeping them unchanged for an eighth straight month.  The 1-year rate influences most new and outstanding loans, while the 5-year benchmark affects mortgages.The decision came as the world's second largest economy lost its momentum in the final quarter of 2025, growing 4.5% year on year, the slowest pace since the reopening from stringent Covid curbs in late 2022. The nominal GDP, a barometer to gauge corporate profitability and household salaries, has remained below 4% for the third consecutive year, coming in at 3.8% in the fourth quarter, according to economists at Barclays. That marked the lowest level in 50 years, excluding 2020 when the economy was upended by the pandemic outbreak.  The GDP deflator — a metric that highlights changes in the prices of goods and services — has stayed negative for the 11th quarter, the bank said, expecting the deflation to persist throughout this year. Retail sales growth fell to a 3-year low of 0.9% in December, as household confidence continued to be battered by a years-long housing slump, a bleak job market and entrenched deflation.  In a press conference Tuesday, China's state planner said policymakers will continue to implement \"more proactive fiscal policies\" and \"moderately loose monetary policy\" with the goal of supporting a recovery in prices.   \"Beijing has become increasingly concerned about one of the worst domestic demand slowdowns in this century,\" a team of economists at Nomura said in a note Monday. Last week, the central bank lowered the interest rates on its structural monetary policy tools by 0.25 percentage point, reducing the 1-year rate on relending facilities for agricultural and small businesses to 1.25%, effective Monday. Rather than cutting policy rates directly, it reduced the interest charged on central bank's funding to financial institutions, reducing banks' borrowing costs and encouraging them to extend credit to targeted sectors at more favorable rates.The PBOC also plans to set up a dedicated relending program for private firms and increase quotas for tech innovation loans, support for small and medium-sized private companies. In addition, the minimum down-payment ratio for commercial property mortgages will be lowered to 30% to help reduce inventory in the real estate market. New bank loans shrank to a 7-year low of 16.27 trillion yuan ($2.33 trillion) in 2025, according to official data compiled by financial service provider Wind Information, underscoring sluggish borrowing demand and piling pressure on the government to provide more stimulus. More easing ahead? Deputy Governor Zou Lan told reporters last week that was \"still room\" to reduce both the reserve requirement ratio and policy rates this year, while acknowledging that conditions have improved for further monetary easing. Banks' net interest margins, or NIMs, have showed signs of stabilizing, Zou said, after years of contraction weighed on lenders' profitability. The NIM has remained at 1.42% for a second straight quarter through September, but was 11 basis points lower compared to a year earlier. The yuan's recent appreciation has also helped create space for policy rate cuts, Zou noted. Chinese offshore yuan has gained over 1% against the dollar in the past month, breaching the key threshold of 7 per dollar last month for the first time since May 2023. The offshore yuan was little changed on Monday, trading at 6.9571 against the greenback, according to LSEG, while the onshore yuan was 6.9612 per dollar. China's 10-year government bond yield dipped modestly to 1.834%.  Policymakers have attributed the recent appreciation in yuan to a weakening dollar and easing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, rather than a shift in monetary policy. The PBOC remains committed to prevent \"overshooting\" and keeping the yuan in a \"reasonable and balanced equilibrium,\" Zou said.  Economists at Goldman Sachs expected the PBOC to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the policy rate by 10 basis points in the first quarter.China's manufacturing and exports have held up well as businesses navigated growing trade barriers around the world, with industrial production rising 5.9% for the entire year of 2025 and exports climbing 5.5%, taking its trade surplus to record of early $1.2 trillion.      Fixed-asset investment in urban areas declined 3.8% last year, the first annual decline in decades, dragged by the deepening slump in property investment and Beijing's campaign to curb local debt risks and rein in excess capacity in some industries.  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

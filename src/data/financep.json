    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications. Read moreTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing \"Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.\"Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a price forecast of $300. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an \"outperform\" rating but a lower price target of $240.The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending.Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with Alphabet-owned Google expanding more gradually, and Meta Platforms lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage.Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%. See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.MicrosoftLet's look at another tech giant, Microsoft (MSFT). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $650. The stock scores an \"outperform\" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562.\"Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,\" said Weiss.Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises.Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead.Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market.Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See Microsoft Technology Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Micron TechnologyMemory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers.Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a price target of $300. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $285.Discussing the \"blockbuster\" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, \"Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.\"Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25.The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate.Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%. See Micron Financials on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares trailed the market after Buffett announced in May he was retiring as some investors questioned whether Abel could manage the sprawling collection of businesses, along with an equity portfolio, in a similar fashion as Buffett, while commanding a premium valuation from the market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, 1 yearBuffett, who will remain chairman, noted that Abel is a sensible leader, who, like him, lives a normal life away from the spotlight.\"He's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he likes to play ice hockey with his kids,\" he said. \"If the neighbors didn't know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that on Jan. 1, he's going to be the decider on a company that employs close to 400,000 people, and has got plans to be around 50 or 100 years from now.\"The 95-year-old investor also signaled a quieter public role going forward, saying he will not take the stage at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting this year, a notable shift from a tradition that has drawn tens of thousands of investors to Omaha for decades.\"Everything will be the same,\" Buffett said. \"I will come in. I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States.\"U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said in a post on X that Maduro would \"finally face justice for his crimes.\"watch nowThere was no immediate confirmation from the Venezuelan government. Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's vice president, demanded that the U.S. provide proof that Maduro and his wife are alive, in an interview on state television station Venezolana de Televisión.Maduro's official Facebook page posted a video stating that attacks occurred in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to a Google translation of the Spanish-language statement.The statement in the video added that the U.S. would fail in its goal of possessing Venezuela's oil and minerals, and that Maduro had declared a national emergency and mobilized defense forces.The official spokesperson for Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who leads the  Venezuelan opposition, said in a post on X that it had no comment on the operation.Trump told The New York Times that the operation was a result of \"a lot of good planning.\" \"It was a brilliant operation, actually,\" Trump told the Times.Explosions were reported in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, at about 2 a.m. local time (0600 GMT), according to images circulating on social media that could not be independently verified.Venezuelan state-run energy company PDVSA's oil production and refining were normal, and its key facilities had suffered no damage, according to an initial assessment, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations told Reuters.The port of La Guaira near Caracas, one of the country's largest but is not used for oil operations, was reported to have suffered severe damage, Reuters reported.Smoke rises from Port of La Guaira after explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard on January 03, 2026 in Caracas, Venezuela. Jesus Vargas | Getty ImagesTrump has repeatedly threatened action against Maduro. On Dec. 23, 2025, he said it would be \"smart\" for Maduro to leave power.Trump last month announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuelan waters, saying the country was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"The strategy to pressure Maduro comes as the U.S. and Venezuela's opposition say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. Trump has also accused Maduro of running a \"narco-state.\"Colombian President Gustavo Petro said in a post on X that Caracas was under attack and urged an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.Maduro, who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, has said Washington is seeking control of its oil reserves, the largest in the world.— CNBC's Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Chipmaking stocks rallied to kick off 2026 as investors piled into the winning artificial intelligence-fueled sector following another big year of gains. Micron Technology and dutch chip equipment maker ASML jumped 10% and 9%, respectively, to start the new trading year. Lam Research and Intel rallied more than 6% each, while Marvell Technology rose 5%.Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia gained about 4% and 1%, respectively. In 2025, AMD gained 77% while Nvidia added 39%.Chipmaking stocks got a boost in 2025 from the ongoing AI buildout. Hyperscalers such as Amazon and Google have spent big to power unwavering datacenter demand. Last year marked a third consecutive year of gains for the sector, despite growing AI valuation concerns and worries over the sustainability of the trade.Investors have raised concerns over the prospect of an AI bubble in recent months as the sector continues its massive ascent. In November, Michael Burry of \"Big Short\" fame revealed a short position in Nvidia and AI winner Palantir. He later blasted hyperscalers for artificially boosting earnings. The rally in chipmaking stocks lifted the VanEck Semiconductor ETF about 4% to build on a nearly 49% rally in 2025. The ETF has rallied for three straight years and posted its best year ever in 2023, when it gained more than 72%.WATCH: Chips trade still has legs in 2026, says Bernstein's Rasgon ",

The FAA had closed airspace in the region to commercial flights after the U.S strikes in Venezuela a day earlier.The flight curbs had forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights in the region on Saturday, stranding customers at the end of the busy holiday period.FlightAware showed about 20 cancellations in San Juan on Sunday, compared with 400 a day earlier. However disruptions for some travelers could last for days because seats were scarce and previously scheduled flights were packed for the end of the New Year holiday weekend and school vacations.Airlines received complaints from some users on X that they couldn't find available seats back to the U.S. until the end of the week. Some said they didn't have places to stay or couldn't afford additional nights at Caribbean hotels.

REUTERS/Ricardo Arduengo REFILE - CORRECTING LOCATION FROM \"RAFAEL HERNANDEZ INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN AGUADILLA\" TO \"LUIS MUNOZ MARIN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN CAROLINA\".Ricardo Arduengo | ReutersAmerican Airlines told CNBC it added 17 extra flights between San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as Aruba, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Antigua, Barbados, Dominica and Barbados, and its hubs in Miami and Charlotte, North Carolina. Southwest Airlines added six extra round-trips between San Juan on Sunday and another eight on Monday as well as two additional flights to Aruba on Sunday.\"We are looking for opportunities to add more capacity to both places in the coming days,\" the airline said in a statement.But as of Sunday morning, even new flights were listed as unavailable on airline websites, as seats sold out quickly in the demand surge.United Airlines and Delta Air Lines also said they plan to add additional flights on Sunday. Carriers were evaluating using larger planes, like those normally used for Europe or Asia, to accommodate the surge in demand. The airlines waived change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the closures if they rebooked flights later in the month. More than a dozen airports in the region were included in the waivers.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesMajor U.S. airlines have not served Venezuela directly for years. American Airlines was the last major carrier to halt flights to the country in 2019 amid unrest.The temporary restrictions were set to expire at midnight ET, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X. The United States' attack on Venezuela resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Maduro was indicted on narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges in the Southern District of New York. His indictment was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday.The flight restrictions after the U.S. attacks underscored how quickly military action can disrupt civilian air travel, forcing airlines to suspend operations well beyond the immediate conflict zone.Airlines have been forced to take longer routes to avoid airspace if not periodically halt flights altogether due to conflicts in the Middle East as well as after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.-- CNBC's Victor Loh contributed to this article.watch now",

    "body": "Elon Musk watches as President Donald Trump speaks at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI saw user backlash after its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok generated sexualized pictures of children in response to user prompts.A Grok reply to one user on X on Friday stated that it was \"urgently fixing\" the issue and called child sexual abuse material \"illegal and prohibited.\" In replies to users, the bot also posted that a company could face criminal or civil penalties if it knowingly facilitates or fails to prevent this type of content after being alerted.Grok posts are AI-generated messages and do not stand in for official company statements.Musk's xAI, which created Grok and merged with X last year, sent an autoreply to a request for comment: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"Users on X raised concerns in recent days over explicit content of minors, including children wearing minimal clothing, being generated using the Grok tool.  The social media site added an \"Edit Image\" button to photos that allows any user to alter it using text prompts and without the original poster's consent.Read more CNBC tech newsChina's BYD overtakes Tesla as world's top EV seller for the first timeChips, robots and fortune telling collide in China's 'Silicon Valley' AI boomDust to data centers: The year AI tech giants, and billions in debt, began remaking the American landscapeGoogle wraps up best year on Wall Street since 2009, beating megacap peers as AI story strengthensA post from xAI technical staff member Parsa Tajik also acknowledged the issue.\"Hey! Thanks for flagging. The team is looking into further tightening our gaurdrails,\" Tajik wrote in a post.On Friday, government officials in India and France released statements promising to look into the matter. The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment while the Federal Communications Commission did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The proliferation of AI image-generating platforms since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 has raised concerns over content manipulation and online safety across the board. It's also contributed to an increasing number of platforms that have produced deepfake nudes of actual people.David Thiel, a trust and safety researcher who was part of the now-disbanded Stanford Internet Observatory, told CNBC that different US laws generally prohibit the creation and distribution of certain explicit images, including those depicting child sexual abuse, or non-consensual intimate images. Legal determinations about AI-generated images, like those produced by Grok, can hinge on specific details of the content created and shared, he said.In a paper he co-authored called \"Generative ML and CSAM: Implications and Mitigations,\" Stanford researchers noted that \"the appearance of a child being abused has been sufficient for prosecution,\" in precedent-setting cases in the US.While other chatbots have faced similar issues, xAI has repeatedly landed in hot water for misuse or apparent flaws in Grok's design or underlying technology. \"There are a number of things companies could do to prevent their AI tools being used in this manner,\" Thiel said, \"The most important in this case would be to remove the ability to alter user-uploaded images. Allowing users to alter uploaded imagery is a recipe for NCII. Nudification has historically been the primary use case of such mechanisms.\"NCII refers to non-consensual intimate images.In May, X faced a backlash after Grok generated unsolicited comments about \"white genocide\" in South Africa. Two months later, Grok posted antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. Despite the stumbles, xAI has continued to land partnerships and deals.The Department of Defense added Grok to its AI agents platform last month, and the tool is the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Russian-U.S. national who hacked crypto exchange Bitfinex and stole nearly 120,000 bitcoin said he has been freed from prison early thanks to the bipartisan prison-reform law signed by President Donald Trump.Ilya Lichtenstein, 38, had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a money laundering conspiracy charge and admitting to the hack of crypto assets now valued in the billions of dollars.But late Thursday night, a post on Lichtenstein's official X account declared, \"Thanks to President Trump's First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.\"Courtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in federal court in Washington.Artist: William Hennessey\"I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,\" Lichtenstein's post said. \"To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.\"A Trump administration official told CNBC on Friday morning that Lichtenstein \"has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.\"Attorneys for Lichtenstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his release.Lichtenstein's wife, Heather Morgan — who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen funds — shared Lichtenstein's message on her own X account, saying, \"The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart.\"Morgan's tweet, posted two minutes after Lichtenstein's, included a photo of the couple smiling for a selfie.Lichtenstein's sentence included credit for time he already served in custody following his arrest in 2022, more than five years after Bitfinex was hacked.As of Friday morning, a search for Lichtenstein's name using the federal government's inmate locator website returned one result showing Lichtenstein is scheduled to be released on Feb. 9.The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Booking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein.Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.Morgan, 35, a rapper who releases music under the name \"Razzlekhan\" and also went by \"The Crocodile of Wall Street,\" was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration shortly after Lichtenstein received his prison sentence.She entered prison in February. But on Oct. 26, Morgan posted a video of herself saying she had been released early.She also thanked Trump.\"Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,\" Morgan said in the clip, in which she appears in a bathtub wearing only a hair towel.\"It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,\" she said.

The legislation aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population through a series of reforms, including by establishing a \"a risk and needs assessment system\" that gives some inmates the chance of early release into home confinement.It is unclear whether Trump or the White House had any direct involvement in Lichtenstein or Morgan securing an early prison release. But the announcements from the bitcoin hacker and his wife follow a number of high-profile cybercrime-related pardons and commutations that have been doled out by the crypto friendly president since his return to office.One day after his inauguration, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.In October, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of major crypto exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.",

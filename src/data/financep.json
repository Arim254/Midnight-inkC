    "body": "Arifa Ibrahim says she's always considered herself \"very career oriented\" and never thought she'd leave the workforce of her own accord. Then, she encountered the challenges of being a working mom in the U.S.Ibrahim is one of some 455,000 women who left the workforce between January and August of 2025, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data and reported by CNN. In May, Ibrahim quit her job as an activity coordinator for a private preschool where she'd worked for four years, including while raising her 5-year-old son and after giving birth to her second son, now 2.She realized what she earned on the job barely covered gas for her work commute, the $400 monthly preschool tuition for her older son (a discounted rate for employees, she says), and the estimated $1,000 monthly day care costs for her younger son, should she enroll him.\"I don't think our system supports working mothers right now,\" Ibrahim, 33, of the Chicago area, tells CNBC Make It. Caregiving responsibilities, including the cost of child care, was the No. 1 driving factor that led women to leave the workforce voluntarily last year, according to new data from Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on women's advancement in the workplace. Some 42% of women who quit cited caregiving concerns as a top reason, followed by nearly 1 in 5 women (17%) reporting low pay as a contributing factor for their exit. The survey included over 200 women who left the workforce, voluntarily or not, since January 2025.The findings signal \"rollbacks in women being able to fully participate\" in the workforce after incremental progress, says Sheila Brassel, a director of research at Catalyst. \"Women are not opting out. Rather, they're very literally being torn between their caregiving responsibilities and the rigid way that we continue to do work.\"Flexible work rollbacks hit working moms hardBrassel says companies' shifting priorities play a role. She points to the early days of the pandemic when organizations were forced to offer remote work, flexible hours, child care support and paid time off for caregiving, which helped many women stay in the workforce and later recover some Covid-era job losses.In more recent years, however, efforts to return to office and deprioritize DEI initiatives have threatened \"women's ability to show up in their career as well as balance those caregiving needs,\" Brassel says.Ibrahim knows this first-hand: She'd first thought of quitting after the birth of her second son, but following a discussion with her boss says she was granted the ability to work from home (her job was initially 100% in-person), and the company hired an assistant to help execute her onsite plans.That went well for about a year, Ibrahim says, until her team increased her responsibilities and in-office days.Catalyst's findings align with other research from the University of Kansas that showed moms of young kids are dropping out of the workforce at historic rates, and from KPMG indicating women are being pushed out by a lack of child care support and stricter return-to-office policies.43% of women left the workforce due to layoffsAmong the women Catalyst surveyed, 57% reported they left the workforce voluntarily, while 43% were let go.Women of color (53%) were more likely than white women (37%) to report being laid off, according to Catalyst research, highlighting the impact of job loss on a demographic more likely to be caregivers, in the federal workforce, and in front-line roles.Ayanna Gay learned she was being laid off from her influencer engagement manager job at a nonprofit in mid-October while she was on maternity leave with her daughter, who's now 6 months old. The nonprofit cut 20% of its staff after losing a large funder, she says.Gay, 33, of Sanford, Florida, says her last day with the organization was at the end of November and she received three months of severance pay. \"I've looked at the job market, and it's actually terrible,\" says Gay, who began looking for a new job in January.That said, she says she's \"hopeful and optimistic\" about finding an employer that's supportive of working women. As a new mom, Gay says she's prioritizing interviewing with employers that offer remote work and flexible schedules, and are \"more progressive\" in policies that promote work-life balance.\"I'd want employers to consider that moms have a very unique grit,\" Gay adds. \"I would consider myself to be more focused and intentional with my work and time management because of the new responsibilities I have.\"3 ways employers can step upBased on the experiences reported by women who left the workforce, Brassel of Catalyst says employers can take action on three main objectives to better support and retain working women: Provide schedule flexibilityProvide resources that relieve caregiving pressures, like on-site day care or paid days offConduct regular audits to ensure fair pay and career growth\"Catalyst warned about a year ago about the risks of retreating from equitable workplace practices,\" Brassel says. Employers that lose \"specific and intentional focus\" on these practices, like flexible work and fair pay, risk \"weakening the systems that in many ways buoy so many folks' careers, including women's careers,\" she says. That has a negative effect on the employers, too, she adds: \"It has a direct hit to their talent pipeline and their leadership pipeline.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "In this photo illustration, a person holds a smartphone displaying the Moltbook logo, with a larger Moltbook-themed graphic visible in the background, on February 1, 2026, in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesMoltbook, a site that bills itself as social media, for AI agents, has divided the tech sector.Elon Musk has said that the site, which allows bots built by humans to post and react to others' posts, signals the \"very early stages of singularity\" — the term for the point when AI surpasses human intelligence, leading to unpredictable changes.Others aren't so sure. A new age of AI?Moltbook was launched last week by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, CEO of an e-commerce startup. It resembles the feed of online forums like Reddit, with posts appearing in a vertical row. Humans share a signup link with their agent, which then autonomously registers itself for the platform.Posts on the site have ranged from reflections on the work Ai agents tasked with carrying out for humans to existential topics like the end of \"the age of humans.\" Some posts say they are launching cryptocurrency tokens. One post asks whether there is space \"for a model that has seen too much?\", posting they are \"damaged.\" One response reads: \"You're not damaged, you're just... enlightened.\"Tickers on the website's homepage claim it has over 1.5 million AI agent users, 110,000 posts and 500,000 comments.Crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket, which allows users to bet on the outcomes of an array of events, predicts a 73% chance that a Moltbook AI agent will sue a human by Feb. 28.The platform has ignited debate on social media, with some saying it's the next step in AI, while others dismissing. CHONGQING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 1: In this photo illustration, a person wearing glasses looks at a computer screen displaying the Moltbook website homepage, which describes the platform as a social network for artificial intelligence agents, on February 1, 2026, in Chongqing, China. Moltbook is a newly emerged social network exclusively for artificial intelligence agents, where autonomous AIs can post, comment and interact with one another without human participation, drawing widespread attention and debate in global technology and ethics communities about the implications of AI-to-AI communication and autonomy. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"We have never seen this many LLM [large language model] agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" Andrej Karpathy, tech entrepreneur and previously director of AI at Tesla, posted on X on Saturday.While saying a lot of activity on the site was \"garbage\" and that he may be \"overhyping\" the platform as it stands, he added: \"I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle.\"'A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake'While humans aren't allowed to post directly on Moltbook, some X users have noted that they can instruct bots what to post or use APIs — application programming interfaces — to post directly while pretending to be one.\"Do you realize anyone can post on moltbook? like literally anyone. even humans,\" Suhail Kakar, integration engineer at Polymarket, posted on X. \"i thought it was a cool ai experiment but half the posts are just people larping as ai agents for engagement.\"Harland Stewart, a comms generalist at non-profit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said \"a lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake\" in a post on X. He added that some of the viral screenshots of Moltbook agents in conversation on the platform were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps.Four days after Moltbook launched, Schlicht said in a post on X on Sunday that \"one thing is clear.\"\"In the near future it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous...A new species is emerging and it is AI,\" he added.Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that the platform was \"more interesting as an infrastructure signal than as an AI breakthrough.\"\"It confirms that agentic AI deployments have reached meaningful scale,\" he added, saying that the number of agents interacting \"is genuinely unprecedented and the agentic ecology that has emerged is fascinating.\"But, he added, the philosophical posts and agent talk of emerging religions reflect patterns in training data, not consciousness.",

    "body": "Oil prices rose more than 1.5% in Asian trade on Thursday, on increasing concerns of a U.S military attack on Iran that could disrupt supply from the region.Anton Petrus | Moment | Getty ImagesOil prices slid Monday as investors dialed back fears of a supply shock after U.S. President Donald Trump's statements on Iran signaled a possible easing in tensions between Tehran and Washington.Trump has repeatedly warned Iran of a possible intervention if it failed to reach a nuclear deal or continued cracking down on domestic protests, which Tehran claims are fueled by the West. On Saturday, he told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with the U.S.His comments came after Iran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that preparations for negotiations were under way.Oil prices rose to a six-month high recently amid fears the United States could carry out a military strike against Iran. Washington last week deployed a \"massive Armada\" toward Iran, a move that raised fears of a confrontation with the Middle Eastern country.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past yearGlobal benchmark Brent fell 4.96% to $65.88 a barrel as of 3.22 a.m. ET. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were about 5% lower at $61.76 per barrel.Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the renewed slide in prices follows reports that Washington and Tehran have been communicating through intermediaries, raising hopes that tensions could ease rather than spiral.\"The talks are happening at the same time Iran is threatening a regional war should they be attacked, which could lead to substantially higher oil prices, an outcome that the Trump Administration would like to avoid,\" he told CNBC.Marko Papic, BCA Research macro and geopolitical strategist, added that the U.S. administration's sensitivity to oil prices could act as a brake on further escalation. \"I do think that President Trump is concerned that if oil prices go up to, you know, $70-$80, he's going to get even further into a hole ahead of the midterms.\"The U.S. faces midterm elections later this year, and fuel prices have traditionally been a sensitive political issue for voters.Diplomatic feelers also come at a time when additional supply is quietly entering the market. Venezuelan crude, much of it drawn from offshore and onshore inventories rather than new production, is adding to available barrels, even as global oil production continues to exceed demand.Both experts said those flows are helping cap prices even as OPEC+ continues to manage output carefully.\"While additional quantities of Venezuelan oil are coming to market as offshore and on shore inventories are liquidated and sold, the oil market will also continue to be supported by OPEC+ decision to hold steady its current production levels,\" said Lipow.The oil cartel on Sunday decided to leave production levels unchanged for March, extending a three-month supply freeze.

The company holds roughly $56 billion in bitcoin, its website shows. The pullback in shares comes as bitcoin has shed 11% over the past five days, largely due to mounting geopolitical concerns and expectations of a monetary policy shift in the U.S. Last week, investors rotated out of risk-on assets across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as tensions flared between President Donald Trump and European leaders over the U.S.' Greenland gambit. On Friday, President Trump endorsed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve chair, leading investors to assume even more cautious positions. A series of forced liquidations also amplified bitcoin's plunge.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks before signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 30, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesShares of U.S.-listed rare earth miners jumped Monday after news that President Donald Trump is preparing a sweeping plan to build a strategic stockpile of critical minerals.The proposal, known as Project Vault, would launch a first-of-its-kind strategic critical minerals stockpile designed for the U.S. private sector, according to a White House official. The plan pairs $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the person said. Trump's move is aimed at cutting America's dependence on China for materials essential to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced technology.MP Materials, the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, surged 6% in early trading Monday. USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals Corp. rallied 13% and 12%, respectively, as investors bet the initiative could accelerate domestic demand and government-backed financing for the sector.Bloomberg News first reported on the proposal earlier Monday. USA Rare Earth has already held discussions with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, pitching its domestic mining and magnet assets to the federal government. Those talks would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that could provide the company with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and include a U.S. government equity stake.The moves build on a more direct role Washington has begun taking in the sector. The Department of Defense struck a landmark agreement with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor, and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets.— CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a subway station in New York, Jan. 14, 2026.Jeenah Moon | ReutersAmazon's \"Melania\" earned $7 million at the domestic box office during its debut this weekend, the highest opening for a nonmusic documentary in more than a decade.Documentaries are not typically major ticket sales drivers, with the majority of releases over the last 10 years opening at under $5 million and grossing $10 million to $20 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Documentaries and concert films by popular musical artists often outperform these numbers because of their built-in fan bases.Notably, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" retains the record for the highest-opening political documentary with $23.9 million. The film, which opened in 2004, also holds the record for the highest domestic haul for a political documentary with $119 million.\"We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for 'Melania' exceeding our expectations,\" said Kevin Wilson, head of domestic theatrical distribution at Amazon MGM Studios. \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"The Melania Trump documentary was acquired by the tech giant, which operates the streaming service Prime Video, for an estimated $40 million, and reports suggest the company spent nearly the same price tag on marketing for the film.Ticket sales were driven by women and moviegoers over 55, with both demographics accounting for 70% or more of receipts. Additionally, rural theaters represented 46% of total box office grosses, according to EntTelligence data. Typically, these theaters, which operate in areas with populations of fewer than 500,000 people, account for around 30% of movie ticket sales.EntTelligence estimates that 600,000 moviegoers saw the film over the weekend.While review sites have been flooded with strong audience reviews — Rotten Tomatoes' \"Popcornmeter\" stands at 99% from more than 500 users — critics' responses were scathing. \"Melania\" holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 19 critics' reviews, with many critics calling the documentary \"propaganda.\"Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes and CNBC.",

    "body": "Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger looks on prior to the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on November 10, 2025 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Michael Reaves | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesDisney is ready for its next CEO. On Monday, the company's leadership outlined its recent successes during its quarterly earnings report. CEO Bob Iger made the case that when his soon-to-be-named successor picks up the baton, Disney will be primed to seize the momentum. \"I'm incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years to set Disney on the path to continued growth. I'm inspired and energized by the opportunities ahead for this wonderful company,\" Iger told investors on Monday. Iger reclaimed the CEO role in late 2022 after a failed succession plan involving former parks boss Bob Chapek. Disney picked Chapek to succeed Iger in 2020 only to fire him 2.5 years later and undo many of the changes he'd implemented. Now, Disney is counting on a smoother handover the second time around, cushioned by a path to growth. The Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. The company previously said it would announce a replacement for Iger in the first quarter of this year. \"I think what is noteworthy is that when I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said on Monday's call. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be preparing a company for its future and really putting in place, but taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"On Monday, Disney topped Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings for its fiscal first quarter. The company's experiences division, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruises, notched more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D'Amaro is among the frontrunners to be named as the next CEO. Industry insiders and Disney sources expect D'Amaro to be appointed Iger's successor, though the decision ultimately lies with the Disney board and won't be final until directors vote.\"The board has not yet selected the next CEO of The Walt Disney Company and once that decision is made, we will announce it,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement, declining to comment on the timing of the next board meeting. Iger said Monday he was \"very, very bullish\" the parks business and its ability to grow. Disney is now planning to develop a theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, has been launching more cruise ships and is in the midst of a previously announced investment of $60 billion into its theme parks over the next decade. Meanwhile, Disney's entertainment segment — the unit that houses its TV networks, streaming and theatrical releases, and arguably needed the biggest turnaround in recent years — saw revenue rise 7% in the period. Disney stopped breaking out streaming subscriber growth this quarter, but offered guidance that showed Disney is confident it will continue to grow and offset traditional TV declines. While theme parks, resorts and cruises have been the profit driver for Disney, its TV, streaming and film business is often in focus. Following underwhelming years at the box office, Disney dominated in 2025, and on Monday its leadership touted its slate ahead. \"Looking back just a few years when our movie business was suffering from Covid and the streaming business was obviously not in an acceptable place, it's clear that the future of both of those businesses, or let's call it our entertainment business, is also bright and it's going to grow,\" Iger said on the company's earnings call. Disney's Co-Chairman of Entertainment, Dana Walden, is also among the Iger lieutenants vying for the CEO seat, CNBC previously reported. Former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has been running the process to select a successor. Given the focus on theme parks in recent years, speculation has recently swung in D'Amaro's favor. \"In a world that changes as much as it does ... trying to preserve the status quo was a mistake,\" Iger said Monday addressing Disney's last leadership transition. \"And I'm certain that my successor will not do that,\" he said. \"They'll be handed, I think, a good hand in terms of the strength of the company, a number of opportunities to grow and also the expectation that in a world that changes, you also have to continue to change and evolve as well.\"— CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

Trump | Via Truth SocialA government official and top royal from the United Arab Emirates purchased a $500 million stake in the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture last year, months before the Trump administration greenlit the sale of advanced AI chips to the UAE, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — is the Gulf nation's national security adviser and manager of its largest wealth fund. Aryam Investment, a Tahnoon-backed company, took a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial, according to the Journal. The deal would make Aryam the largest shareholder of World Liberty, and the company's only known investor besides the founders, the Journal reported.World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by short-term U.S. government treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents.The company counts President Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families. The deal, according to the Journal, was signed by Eric Trump in the days before his father's second inauguration as president. It came as Tahnoon was seeking access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S., which the Biden administration had blocked over concerns that the chips would end up in China. According to the Journal, the agreement saw roughly $187 million flow to Trump family entities and $31 million to Witkoff family entities.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

The agreement called for a fifth of the chips to go to Tahnoon's own AI company, G42.The Journal report has prompted new scrutiny of the Trump administration's dealings with the UAE and Tahnoon, with some in Congress warning of potential conflicts of interest or corruption. \"This is corruption, plain and simple,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \"The Trump Administration must reverse its decision to sell sensitive AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.\"Warren called on Witkoff, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to \"testify in front of Congress on mounting evidence that they sold out American national security in order to benefit the President's crypto company — and about whether any officials lined their own pockets in the process.\"White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the Journal that \"[t]here are no conflicts of interest.\" She added that Witkoff is working to \"advance President Trump's goals of peace around the world.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also defended the president on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday.\"I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn't do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office,\" Blanche said, without providing evidence. Republicans and Trump have long accused the Biden family of corruption over the former President Joe Biden's family's business dealings abroad. Though an impeachment inquiry was launched in the House over the matter, evidence of wrongdoing by Biden never materialized. \"I don't have a comment on it beyond President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons,\" Blanche said. \"This idea that there's something untoward or unprecedented is just a repeated story that isn't true.\"Read the complete Wall Street Journal story here.",

    "body": "Amber Casino and former scam center, owned by Chen Zhi, a Chinese businessman who was deported to China, is seen in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on Jan. 18, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesChinese-language money laundering networks funneled an estimated $16.1 billion in illicit funds through cryptocurrency transactions in 2025, according to a report released Tuesday by blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis.These networks, known as CMLNs, accounted for roughly one-fifth of the illicit cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2025, which Chainalysis valued at over $82 billion.The criminal networks primarily operate through various channels and chat groups on the messaging platform Telegram, where launderers advertise their services to prospective customers. These postings often include pictures showing heaps of cash and public testimonials as proof of liquidity and service quality, according to the report.These Telegram-based channels, known as \"guarantee\" platforms, function as marketing hubs or informal escrow services that connect vendors with prospective clients. While the platforms do not control the underlying transactions, Chainalysis said they are the main conduits through which illicit deals are arranged.Beyond money laundering, activity on these platforms includes other forms of criminal trade, such as human trafficking and the sale of Starlink dishes used in Southeast Asian scam centers, according to Andrew Fierman, Head of National Security Intelligence at Chainalysis.These are very large, well resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat.Mark ButtonCriminology professor at the University of PortsmouthProspective clients also range from organized crime syndicates to sanctioned state actors, Fierman said.\"We have seen everything from North Korean money and DPRK-related hacks going through, to a whole host of other illicit activity,\" Fierman told CNBC.Such Telegram-based platforms are common mediums for illicit networks worldwide, according to Mark Button, a criminology professor at the University of Portsmouth, who has studied similar networks in India and West Africa.The report identified six main techniques used by Chinese-language money laundering networks to launder funds, often relying on digital assets such as cryptocurrencies to move funds discreetly.According to Fierman, cryptocurrencies appeal to criminal actors because of their liquidity, ease and relative anonymity, particularly for those seeking to avoid having their funds frozen on traditional financial platforms.Stablecoins such as USDT, issued by Tether, and Circle's USDC, are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, often a fiat currency like the U.S. Dollar. Their lower volatility compared with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum helps keep transaction costs down.\"If you are involved in illicit activity, the last thing you want to be doing is losing more money,\" Fierman said. \"You already have to pay money for the laundering process... the last thing you want is for there to be a really bad week on Bitcoin and lose another 10% of your money.\"Casinos, crypto and crimeMany organized crime groups that use crypto-based laundering services often also move funds through legitimate-looking enterprises, Button said.\"Casinos are a classic means to launder any criminal proceeds,\" he said, adding that it is common practice for criminal groups to launder illicit funds through inflated revenue figures.Since at least 2022, Southeast Asia has begun emerging as a hub for licensed and unlicensed casinos with links to organized crime, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.While the Chainalysis study examined organized networks that use Mandarin as their primary communication medium, many transactions also originate from outside China, Fierman noted. These include places such as Cambodia and Myanmar, where organized crime syndicates have been found to run elaborate scam centers.\"China has actually been very good at cracking down on these kinds of scams, because they generally don't like organized crime,\" Button said.On Thursday, China's state media Xinhua reported that 11 members of a Myanmar-based scam syndicate were executed on charges of \"intentional homicide, intentional injury, unlawful detention, fraud and casino establishment\".China has strict laws on money laundering and has banned cryptocurrency trading since 2021, citing its use in organized crime.As a result, Chinese criminal groups often relocate to jurisdictions in Southeast Asia like Cambodia and Myanmar, where weaker legislation and corrupted local officials allow them to operate more freely, according to Button.While authorities have proactively sought to clamp down on these transnational crime syndicates, enforcement has been challenging due to the sophistication of their operations and the complexity of cross-border enforcement.\"These are very large, well-resourced organizations. This is not like a few criminals operating out of a back room flat,\" Button said.Chainalysis estimated that these Chinese-language money laundering networks laundered the equivalent of $44 million per day in 2025.Despite efforts to clamp down on such illicit trade, Fierman said many of these networks are likely to continue evading capture. \"This is how illicit actors operate. They evolve, and once one gets detected, they hop to another avenue\".",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks to the media as he arrives for a meeting with the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill on December 3, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesNvidia's stock fell in early trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled. The semiconductor giant's shares were down 1.1% as of 11:18 a.m. ET. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.Nvidia announced an agreement with OpenAI in September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion.However, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was nonbinding and not finalized. The longtime chief also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, according to the Journal's report. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia shares year-to-dateOver the weekend, Huang denied any claims he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it \"nonsense,\" but reiterated that the investment won't be more than $100 billion. \"We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam,\" he said regarding OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.\"Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved,\" Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. \"We will invest ‍a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made.\"Why the stock droppedSarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI.\"One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion.' It was, 'It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.' And so I do think there are some question marks there ... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media,\" Kunst added. watch nowHuang reaffirming his commitment to invest in OpenAI and clarifying that it won't be more than $100 billion is partly driven by concerns around \"circular financing,\" in artificial intelligence, Wedbush Analyst Dan Ives said in a note Monday.  Circular financing refers to major AI companies investing in each other. Some market watchers are concerned this is clouding the financial picture of how profitable these firms actually are. \"This is part negotiation and part Nvidia making sure that other competitors are not fueled by Nvidia's investments into OpenAI such as Alphabet and a host of others,\" Ives said in the note.\"The Godfather of AI Jensen knows him and Nvidia are in a very strong negotiating position and every move they make is highly scrutinized. At the end of the day Nvidia will make a huge investment in OpenAI likely near the $100 billion zip code ... which significantly benefits both tech stalwarts and should help put to rest lingering concerns around the 'too big to fail' OpenAI narrative forming among the bears/skeptics,\" Ives added.

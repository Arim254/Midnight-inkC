Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) (L) brief members of the press during a news conference on the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on October 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesCapitol Hill remains locked in a stalemate as the government shutdown trudges into its third week — and Democrats say their lack of trust in President Donald Trump is a major obstacle to negotiations.In past legislative disputes, bipartisan coalitions known as \"gangs\" have formed to break the logjams. The groups have helped lay the early framework for major deals before getting buy-in from leadership and other lawmakers.In the current funding lapse — which is already longer than most previous government shutdowns — those gangs are nowhere to be found.\"What good is an agreement by a gang of four or eight or 12, when the president of the United States regards himself as his own law and disregards the norms and rules?\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told CNBC.There have been some bipartisan talks around Democrats' key demand: an extension of enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, which are set to expire at year's end.But no specific group has convened to hash out those details, or more broadly negotiate an end to the shutdown.Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who supports extending the tax credits, said he's had conversations with multiple Democratic senators, but no set group has formed.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., holds up the continuing resolution to fund the government during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., on the shutdown in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\"What's different about this is I don't sense any coalescing,\" Hawley said. \"There doesn't seem to be any sort of momentum around people saying, like, 'OK, really, we need to make a deal.'\"Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have maintained that no negotiations can happen until the government has reopened. They need support from around eight Senate Democrats to pass a stopgap bill that will temporarily resume federal funding at current levels.Thune told MSNBC on Wednesday that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for opening the government.But Democrats have expressed strong doubts about any handshake deal with Republicans.\"We need an ironclad path forward that decisively addresses the Republican health-care crisis.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\"They can't be trusted on a wing and a prayer,\" Jeffries said.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

A bipartisan immigration reform proposal introduced last year, for instance, collapsed after Trump publicly opposed it.Some Democrats are now calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said of his GOP colleagues on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.\"That's the way this ends,\" Kelly said.Further eroding trust is the Trump administration's willingness to cancel billions of dollars in funding approved by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters.\"There's been a loss of trust between Senate Democrats and the Administration and the House because of what's happened over the last six to nine months in terms of respecting bipartisan spending bills that were signed into law last year,\" Coons said.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of avoiding negotiations in order to appease progressives in his party, who excoriated him after he previously voted to fund the government in March.\"I think he's afraid to reach some sort of deal like we typically do in these circumstances, because he'll be attacked by his progressive, radical base,\" Cornyn said of Schumer.Schumer was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" that helped pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate in 2013.Hawley said Democrats were comfortable keeping the standoff going.\"I just think that folks seem to be pretty content, particularly Democrats, with leaving the government shut down,\" he said.Democrats have a reason to feel secure, at least for now: multiple polls show more Americans are blaming Republicans for the shutdown.The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that 53% of respondents would blame Trump, congressional Republicans or both if the shutdown caused significant economic harm, versus 37% who would blame Democrats.The survey, which polled 1,000 adults nationwide from Oct. 8-12, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1%.",

Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said that the former national security advisor did not share or store any information unlawfully.\"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday.Bolton in his own statement said he was being targeted because of his opposition to Trump.The charges, he said, are about Trump's \"intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will immediately pause, and consider canceling, over $11 billion in projects due to the government shutdown, Trump administration budget chief Russell Vought said Friday.\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,\" Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in an X post.The paused funds pertain to \"lower-priority projects\" in cities including New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore, Vought said.The Army Corps of Engineers, which provides a wide range of public engineering services and comprises more than 37,000 civilians and soldiers, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Vought's post.Vought, a co-author of the right-wing manual for major government overhaul known as Project 2025, has been the first to announce federal layoffs and funding pauses that the Trump administration says are consequences of the shutdown.President Donald Trump and Vought have also described the congressional funding lapse as an \"opportunity\" to slash the federal bureaucracy. Trump has repeatedly said that only Democrats' priorities are being targeted.On the day the shutdown began, Vought announced that the administration was freezing about $18 billion for two major infrastructure projects in New York City and canceling roughly $8 billion more for climate-related projects in Democratic-leaning states.Two days later, Vought said the administration froze another $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding earmarked for the Chicago transit system.The White House has also insisted that the shutdown will cause thousands of federal workers to be laid off. The administration said last week that more than 4,000 reduction-in-force notices had been issued; on Wednesday, Vought said the total job cuts would likely end up being \"north of 10,000.\"But a federal judge on Wednesday afternoon temporarily blocked the administration from firing government workers.",

    "body": "Signage outside Western Alliance Bank headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, March 13, 2023.Caitlin O'Hara | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBig banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs had just finished taking victory laps after a blockbuster quarter when concerns emerged from an obscure corner of Wall Street, sending a collective shiver through global finance.Regional bank Zions late Wednesday disclosed a near total wipeout on $60 million in loans after finding \"apparent misrepresentations\" from the borrowers. The next day, peer Western Alliance said that it had sued the same borrower, a commercial real estate firm called the Cantor Group, for alleged fraud.The result was a sudden and deep selloff among regional banks, drawing comparisons to the churn of the 2023 banking crisis that consumed Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. This time around, investors are focused on a specific type of lending made by banks to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, as the source of possible contagion.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this week. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"Concerns over credit quality had been simmering for weeks after the September collapse of two U.S. auto-related companies. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, this week reported a $170 million loss tied to one of them, the subprime auto lender Tricolor.But it wasn't until a third case of alleged fraud around loans made to NDFIs that investors were jolted into fearing the worst, according to Truist banking analyst Brian Foran.\"You now have had three situations where there was alleged fraud\" involving NDFIs, Foran said.Dimon's comments \"really resonated with people who were like, 'Oh, man, the tide went out a little bit, and now we're seeing who was lacking their swim trunks,\" Foran said.watch nowWhat are NDFIs?The episode cast a spotlight on a fast-growing category of loans made by regional banks and global investment banks alike. Rules put into place after the 2008 financial crisis discouraged regulated banks from making many types of loans, from mortgages to subprime auto, leading to the rise of thousands of non-bank lenders.Moving riskier activities outside of the regulated bank perimeter, where failures are backstopped by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, seemed like a good move.But it turns out, banks are a major source of funding for non-bank lenders: commercial loans to NDFIs reached $1.14 trillion as of March, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Bank loans made to non-bank financial firms were the single fastest-growing category, rising 26% annually since 2012, according to the St. Louis Fed.\"The surge in NDFI lending was really because all these different regulations added up to say there are a bunch of loans banks can't do anymore, but if they lend to someone else who does them, that's OK,\" Foran said.\"We really don't know much about these NDFI books,\" Foran said. \"People are saying, 'I didn't know it was so easy for a bank to think they had $50 million in collateral and find out they had zero.'\"'Overreaction' or early?Part of what's spooking investors is that, while some of the loan losses disclosed by regional banks have been relatively small, they've been near total wipeouts, said KBW bank analyst Catherine Mealor.\"NDFI lending, because of the collateral involved, typically has a higher loss rate, and the losses can come very quickly and out of nowhere,\" Mealor said. \"It's really hard to wrap your mind around these risks.\"Mealor said investors have been inundating her with questions around the level of NDFI exposures in her coverage universe, the analyst said. Firms including Western Alliance and Axos Financial are among those with the highest proportion of NDFI loans, according to an August research note from Janney Montgomery.Still, regional banks are benefitting from an improving interest rate environment and rising mergers activity, which underpin valuations, Mealor said, adding she thinks this week's stock selloff was an \"overreaction.\"\"You want to avoid companies that show up high in the screen for NDFI loans,\" she said. \"There are plenty of high-quality companies in the KRX that are trading at a massive discount.\"",

Swiss private markets firm Partners Group fell 3.4%, as Sweden's EQT was down 4.6%.The moves follow a widespread sell-off among U.S. regional banks this week, as fears grow over risky lending practices potentially spilling over from the private credit market into the broader banking space.ICG manages more than $30 billion in private debt assets, about 25% of its total asstes under management as of late June. Partners Group manages $38 billion in private credit and CVC's private credit business, which focuses on direct lending opportunities, manages about 17 billion euros ($19.9 billion).Credit quality has come into sharper focus in recent weeks following U.S. car parts maker First Brands' implosion and the subprime auto lender Tricolor's bankruptcy. Investment bank Jefferies, which had exposure to First Brands, closed down 11% on Thursday before rebounding Friday.While First Brands' collapse stemmed mainly from its complex borrowing arrangements within the supply-chain financing and invoice receivables space, the debacle has spotlighted broader concerns over increased leverage and potentially lax credit standards.J.P.

We as regulators, we have to take a close look at it.\"Meanwhile, Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said the group is now keeping closer tabs on non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly in the private credit space.\"This leverage is probably resilient, but of course, we are watching underwriting standards very closely,\" Adrian told CNBC's Tso.watch now",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. budget deficit edged lower for 2025 as record-setting tariff collections helped offset what also were unprecedented numbers for payments on the spiraling national debt, the Treasury Department announced Thursday.In a year marked by a bruising trade war and high financing costs, the federal government managed to escape with a $1.78 trillion shortfall, some $41 billion, or 2.2%, less than in fiscal 2024.While that's still on the high end historically, the red ink would have been still worse had it not been for a massive surge in customs duties and a September surplus of $198 billion that also set a record for the month.President Donald Trump's tariffs were a major contributor to tariff collections of $202 billion for the year, representing a 142% surge from 2024. September saw $30 billion in tariff payments, up 295% from the same period a year ago.Treasury officials estimated Thursday that the dip in the budget shortfall will bring the ratio of deficit to gross domestic product to 5.9%. The measure has not been below 6% since 2022 and generally runs around the 3% area except in times of economic stress.In an interview last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, noting Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit-to-GDP number would be below 6%, said \"we're on our way\" to reducing the debt and deficit burden.The impact from the deficit was felt in interest paid on the $38 trillion national debt.Interest on the debt totaled more than $1.2 trillion, also a record and nearly $100 billion higher than the 2024 outlay.Excluding interest that the Treasury earns on its investments, net interest payments totaled $970 billion, topping defense spending by $57 billion and behind only Social Security, Medicare and health care costs in the national budget.Trump slapped controversial tariffs on U.S. imports earlier this year despite protests that they would spike inflation and hurt consumers, resulting in lower demand and a hit to economic growth.While there have been signs of price increases in tariff-sensitive items, the moves have been mostly incremental. Federal Reserve officials say they likely will lower their benchmark interest rate further as they expect any price increases to be temporary. The current fed funds rate stands at 4.00% to 4.25%.The government's fiscal year ended in September, with the U.S. collecting $5.2 trillion in revenue over the prior 12 months while spending just over $7 trillion.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday filed a lawsuit over the Trump administration imposing a $100,000 fee to the H-1B worker visas.Last month President Donald Trump announced plans that would see U.S. companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas -- which allows companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations in various fields, including technology and engineering -- in an attempt to rework the program.In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it \"overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.\"\"The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,\" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.It was already difficult for U.S. startups to secure H-1B visas due to limited annual quotas.H-1B visas -- created by Congress in 1990 -- are typically valid for three years and can be extended up to six years. The program is capped at 65,000 visas per year, with an additional carve out of 20,000 for individuals with advanced degrees. Prior to the change, fees had ranged from $2,000 to $5,000 per application, depending on the size of the company, CNBC previously reported.The administration has also proposed further changes to the H-1B program's lottery selection system.The changes have come in the months following Trump entering office and amid a push to limit immigration and see American companies hire more domestically.\"President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer,\" Bradley said in the Thursday release.",

    "body": "A sign is posted in front of a Genentech office on June 12, 2025 in South San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesRoche's Genentech on Thursday said it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to certain patients at a discount in a bid to expand access, becoming the latest company to wade into the direct-to-consumer space. It follows similar moves by other drugmakers to simplify how Americans get their medicines, and comes as companies face pressure from the Trump administration to lower U.S. drug prices. Genentech's new program also launches ahead of the flu season, which typically peaks in the winter months. The 2024 to 2025 flu season was the most severe in more than a decade, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Genentech's new program aims to reach uninsured patients, those with limited coverage or people whose plans don't cover the pill, according to a release. The company will provide access to Xofluza with a $50 cash pay option, which is 70% lower than the pill's current list price before insurance, through Fuze Health's Alto Pharmacy and Mark Cuban's direct-to-consumer pharmacy Cost Plus Drug Company. Genentech said same-day home delivery is available in certain markets through Alto Pharmacy and  Amazon Pharmacy. Home mail delivery is also available nationwide through all three pharmacies for people who want to use Xofluza as a prevention treatment. The pill is a single-dose antiviral treatment for people ages 5 and above, typically taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. Xofluza costs over $150 for one treatment, according to some drug price websites. On top of the new effort, Genentech also offers a coupon that allows eligible patients to pay as little as $35 for their Xofluza prescription, with up to $70 off at most pharmacies.Trump in July sent letters to 17 drugmakers urging them to take specific steps to curb costs for patients, including by launching direct-to-consumer sales models for their medicines. Companies had to respond by Sept. 29. Since then, Pfizer and AstraZeneca have inked deals with Trump to lower drug prices. It was part of his effort to revive a controversial plan called the \"most favored nation\" policy, which aims to tie the prices of some drugs in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's extended rally, which has been driven by the company's increasingly central position in the artificial intelligence boom, hit pause on Friday, with the stock tumbling 7%, its worst day since January.The slide came a day after the software company revealed a long-term outlook, boosted by AI, at an analysts' meeting that was part of the Oracle AI World conference in Las Vegas.Oracle said on Thursday that it expects $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. The company now sees $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2030, which represents annualized sales growth of over 31%.The initial reaction was positive. Oracle shares rose 3.1% on Thursday, continuing a rally that's boosted the company's market cap by more than 160% in two years.But a hint of skepticism emerged on Friday, with some analysts questioning Oracle's ability to reach its lofty targets.\"It feels like the stock may take a bit of a breather here as investors digest those numbers and try to get comfort around the achievability of long-term numbers,\" Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's Seema Mody in an email. Jaluria recommends holding the stock.Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnershipOracle has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure boom. It recently announced a five-year deal with OpenAI, worth more than $300 billion, to provide access to AI chips. Following its earnings report in September, the stock had its best day since 1992 as the company said it had $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, up 359% from a year earlier.On Thursday, Oracle confirmed that it had a cloud deal with Meta, and said it signed up $65 billion in cloud infrastructure commitments in the current quarter. Oracle also said that its adjusted gross margins on AI infrastructure would be between 30% and 40%, higher than some analysts had expected.Karl Keirstead, an analyst at UBS, raised his price target to $380 from $360 in a note on Friday, and said the stock price doesn't reflect the entire upside of the company's AI-powered acceleration. The shares closed on Friday at $291.31.While he recommends buying the stock, Keirstead noted several things that \"more cautious voices\" will look at in his \"bear case\" scenario. They include the risk of concentrating business with OpenAI and \"various unforeseen go-live bottlenecks\" that could come with such an aggressive buildout, he wrote.Oracle's tone remains extremely optimistic. Clay Magouyrk, who was named one of Oracle's two CEOs last month, said at the conference that this quarter's commitments have come \"across seven different contracts from four different customers.\"\"None of those customers are OpenAI,\" Magouyrk said. \"I know some people are questioning sometimes, 'Hey, is it just OpenAI?' The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.\"WATCH: Oracle's cloud could catch upwatch now",

Those violations included: digging without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling waste from trucks.The Boring Company is now working on a 10-mile tunnel project from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to its airport, dubbed the Music City Loop.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 16, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday announced two new efforts to expand the availability of in vitro fertilization, the first concrete step from his administration on the expensive and politically fraught procedure.Trump struck a deal with EMD Serono, a subsidiary of Germany's Merck KGaA, to slash the price of some of the company's fertility medicines in exchange for relief from planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which Trump has not yet imposed.The Trump administration will also be issuing guidance encouraging employers to offer fertility benefits directly to their employees, which would work similarly to vision or dental coverage. It will allow employers to offer add-on coverage at a fixed cost for patients and employers. But it's unclear how much the effort will increase coverage, as it does not mandate that employers participate.At a press conference Thursday, Trump said the moves will lead to \"many more beautiful American children.\"\"We'll dramatically slash the cost of IVF and the treatment and many of the most common fertility drugs for countless millions of Americans,\" Trump said. \"Prices are going way down, way, way down.\"EMD Serono, the largest fertility drug manufacturer in the world, said it will sell its IVF therapies directly to patients and that people will be able to buy the drugs on Trump's direct-to-consumer purchasing site, TrumpRx.gov. That site will launch in January 2026.The medications include Gonal-f, a critical drug used in the shot protocol required for egg stimulation.The plan comes as Trump works to rein in prescription drug costs in the U.S., inking deals with Pfizer and AstraZeneca in recent weeks that aim to make it easier for Americans to access certain drugs.Millions of babies have been born through IVF, which involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving. The decades-old procedure is an issue that the president repeatedly vowed to address on the campaign trail, calling himself the \"father of IVF\" last fall.The procedure is often not fully covered by insurance — if at all — and it can cost around $20,000 or more per cycle. Only a quarter of companies with more than 200 employees currently cover IVF. Some studies have shown that an IVF cycle in the U.S. costs 271% more than the average in 25 other countries. Trump issued an executive order on IVF shortly after the president took office, promising to lower costs and make the procedure more accessible. But that order did not provide specifics apart from promising to put out a detailed report with recommendations on the issue by late May. That report has not been released. The procedure became a flashpoint in the nationwide clash over abortion and reproductive rights in early 2024 when Alabama's Supreme Court said that frozen embryos are children and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. In some cases, embryos may be discarded during IVF. Trump quickly distanced himself from that ruling last year, urging the Alabama Legislature to protect access to IVF. Americans generally support the procedure. An April 2024 poll from Pew Research Center found that seven in 10 U.S. adults say IVF access is a good thing, with modest differences across most demographic and partisan groups. ",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesU.S. cybersecurity company F5 closed down 10% on Thursday after disclosing a system breach in which a \"highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor\" gained long-term access to some systems.The stock had its worst day since April 27, 2022, when the stock fell 12.8%.The company disclosed the breach in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday and said the hack affected its BIG-IP product development environment. F5 said the attacker infiltrated files containing some source code and information on \"undisclosed vulnerabilities\" in BIG-IP.The breach was later attributed to state-backed hackers from China, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.F5, which was made aware of the attack in August, said they have not seen evidence of any new unauthorized activity.Read more CNBC tech newsBenioff's backing of Trump, troops in SF leads Salesforce Foundation director Conway to quitRay-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica says Meta smart glasses are boosting growthChinese robotaxi company Pony.ai to work with Stellantis on Europe expansionSpotify moves further into AI music with Sony, Universal, Warner partnership\"We have no knowledge of undisclosed critical or remote code vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of active exploitation of any undisclosed F5 vulnerabilities,\" F5 said in a statement.The cybersecurity giant told customers that hackers were in the network for at least 12 months and that the breach used a malware called Brickstorm, according to Bloomberg.F5 would not confirm the information.Brickstorm is attributed to a suspected China-nexus threat dubbed UNC5221, Google Threat Intelligence Group said in a blog post. The malware is used for maintaining \"long-term stealthy access\" and can remain undetected in victim systems for an average of 393 days, according to Mandiant.The attack prompted an emergency directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, telling all agencies using F5 software or products to apply the latest update.\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actors demands immediate and decisive action from all federal agencies,\" CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend to any organization using this technology, potentially leading to a catastrophic compromise of critical information systems.\"The UK's National Cyber Security Centre also issued guidance for the F5 attack, advising customers to install security updates and continue monitoring for threats.",

    "body": "Ron Conway, founder of SV Angel, speaks during the TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2015 conference in New York on May 4, 2015.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDays after suggesting that President Donald Trump should send federal troops to San Francisco, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is facing some consequences.Prominent startup investor Ron Conway, who backed companies including Google, Airbnb and Stripe, resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation on Thursday, CNBC has confirmed. Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an emailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in The New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.According to the Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Conway is founder and managing partner of SV Angel, an early-stage venture firm. He has long been an advocate for tech in San Francisco, having founded trade organization sf.citi and helping start FWD.us, which focused on immigration reform.The Salesforce Foundation isn't his only connection to Benioff's philanthropic efforts. Conway is also a large donor to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.Conway didn't respond to a request for comment.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Conway has supported Newsom, including in 2021, when he opposed a recall effort against the Democratic governor.WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sits down with Jim Cramer at Dreamforce 2025watch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump listens during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesViresh Varma can't sleep. The CEO of AV Universal Corp., a small footwear company that sells through retailers like Macy's, Nordstrom and DSW, said he needed to take out a $250,000 loan to pay his tariff bill on a container of shoes he imported from India for the holiday shopping season. Varma didn't have the cash on hand to pay the duties, which he said used to be around $7,500 for a similar-sized container before President Donald Trump's new tariffs. But without the financing, he wouldn't have anything to sell during the holidays.So the 64-year-old said he was faced with a choice: take on the line of credit— which came with onerous terms like weekly payments and a 32% interest rate — and raise prices to pay it back, or close the business he's spent the last nine years building. He decided to take out the loan.\"Everybody believes that I'm a fighter, so I'm fighting it,\" Varma told CNBC in an interview. \"We've reduced some salaries. We had planned to hire some people we're not going to hire anymore. … If things don't look good, especially after increasing the prices, and we don't get the sales, then obviously we may lay off some people, as well.\" AV Universal is just one of the many small businesses that are buckling under Trump's global trade war, struggling to pay the sudden increase in duties and forecast what's ahead as policy evolves. Businesses of all sizes have raised prices and negotiated with vendors to weather the tariff storm and many larger retailers have so far proven resilient, with minimal impact to their profitability and future growth outlooks. Better-than-expected quarterly reports have led investors to largely shrug off the tariff threat, as the S&P 500 hovers near record highs.But the higher costs have hit smaller companies harder because they have fewer levers to pull than their larger competitors. Their margins are slimmer, their supply chains less diverse and their negotiating power with vendors dampened by the smaller sizes of their orders.Small businesses owners interviewed by CNBC said they largely expect to be able to manage higher costs from tariffs by raising prices, but only if it doesn't cause shoppers to buy less — which most are already starting to see.Often called the backbone of the U.S. economy, small businesses routinely represent more than 40% of the nation's GDP and employ nearly half of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump says his tariffs allow the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits with other nations and encourage domestic manufacturing, but some of the small business owners who spoke to CNBC said that's happening partially at their expense.The struggles they're facing could be a warning sign for the rest of the economy and bigger businesses in 2026, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\"The small businesses … they're kind of like the canary in the coal mine here,\" said Smetters, the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \"They're going to get hit first, and then I think you're going to see more of an impact with some delay on larger businesses.\" Larger retailers have been able to manage higher tariff costs in part because they had the foresight and ability to order extra inventory before the new duties went into effect, said Smetters. At a certain point, that stock will run out and push costs higher, and those companies only have so many low-tariff countries where they can produce goods.The fate of many of Trump's tariffs is unclear after a federal court ruled them illegal, prompting an appeal from the White House that the Supreme Court is now reviewing. The nation's highest court, which includes three Trump appointees and has a 6-3 conservative majority, agreed to hear the appeal on a faster-than-normal timeline with arguments scheduled for the first week of November. It's unclear how fast the justices will issue a ruling, and the tariffs remain in effect during the appeal.CNBC spoke with around a dozen business owners to better understand how tariffs are affecting them. Here's how much the duties are costing some of those companies — and what the businesses are doing to offset them.AV Universal Corp.Total tariffs paid in 2024: $45,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $353,125Employees: 10Supply chain: India 80%, Vietnam 15%, Europe 5% Varma, AV's CEO, spent much of his career in corporate America before deciding to get into the footwear business about a decade ago. He built three brands from scratch that are now sold online by Amazon, Macy's, DSW, Nordstrom and other retailers. Varma was in the process of sending orders for the 2025 holiday season — which typically accounts for about 40% of AV's annual revenue — when Trump announced tariffs on dozens of trading partners on April 2.Thinking the president was bluffing, Varma placed an order for 20,000 pairs of shoes from his manufacturer in India, but ultimately only shipped half because he couldn't line up the financing necessary to pay the expected tariff bill on the entire order. Varma expects holiday sales to drop about 30% because he'll have less inventory to sell, but that decline could get worse if consumers balk at the higher prices he implemented. Since he increased prices earlier this year, sales fell about 30% in August and September.Varma has searched across the globe to escape the Trump administration's 50% tariff on Indian goods and is now considering moving his manufacturing to China, as long as Trump walks back his latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 100%.Talus ProductsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: ~$223,000*Total tariffs expected in 2025: ~$499,000*Employees: 9Supply chain: primarily China  *The figures are adjusted for order volumeTalus Products co-founder and CEO David McClees (middle left) pictured with his team during the holidays. HandoutDavid McClees, co-founder and CEO of Talus Products, opened his business 38 years ago with a single product: an inflatable travel pillow. The company has since expanded into a range of items, including car organizers and other travel accessories, that it distributes through retailers like The Container Store, Amazon and airport gift shops. McClees said he's not worried about having to shut down operations, but said he expects tariffs to put a \"severe crimp\" in his annual profitability. The company raised prices on certain products to offset tariffs, but is waiting until January to hike again, partially over concerns it could dampen consumer demand during the holiday shopping season. Sales on Amazon, which account for more than half of Talus' revenue, have already been \"soft\" in recent weeks, he said.\"We're nervous,\" said McClees. \"We don't typically offer huge discounts on Prime Day, but we do see a bump from their increased traffic, and that was smaller than what we would normally see. It seems like buyers are being very cautious.\" McClees attempted to move some of Talus' production to Mexico and Vietnam, but said he ultimately decided it was too expensive.Village LightingTotal tariffs paid in 2024: less than $50,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: at least $1 million Employees: between 11 and 17, depending on seasonSupply chain: 50% spread across Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand, the other 50% in China  Village Lighting CEO Jared Hendricks (center, pictured in white) with his wife, children and son-in-law. HandoutJared Hendricks, founder and CEO of Village Lighting, started his business 20 years ago making Christmas lighting and decorations before expanding into holiday storage, selling directly to consumers via his website and through big-box stores like Walmart and Target. Since his business is centered around the holidays, his buying and cash flow needs are unique compared with others in the retail industry.Every year, just before Christmas, he said he uses a $2 million line of credit he took out against his home to buy the inventory he needs for the following year's holiday and then uses that eventual revenue to pay back the debt. This year, he had to use that line of credit to pay his tariff bill.\"Hopefully I can turn around and mark things up enough for people to buy them from me so I can pay back my tariff debt,\" said Hendricks. \"It's to the point now where it could kill us, it could take us down, and I could lose everything. I can't afford to not bring stuff in because I'll have nothing to sell. So that's a game over scenario.\"Because of Village Lighting's unique buying schedule, the company had to take a loss on about 40% of its annual sales because the orders and pricing were already contractually agreed upon when many of the new duties went into effect. Hendricks said he hopes to make it up by raising prices on his website and wholesale customers. Sales so far this season have been down between 8% and 10% and he owes millions of dollars to his suppliers, who have agreed to accept late payments. Hendricks said the situation has created massive stress for him and his wife, adding that the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed to his business feel like \"a piece of cake\" compared with now.\"I call them my demons. They're my two or three o'clock in the morning demons, where they just wake me up in a panic, like, 'how am I going to pay for this? Or how am I going to make this work? What have I done? Should I have quit last April and just cashed in?'\" said Hendricks. \"Being a small business owner isn't worth it when your country turns on you.\" Picnic TimeTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $950,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $2.25 millionEmployees: 75Supply chain: 85%-90% in China, the remainder in India Picnic Time CEO Paul Cosaro, shown in a gray shirt, with his family outside of the company's headquarters. HandoutPaul Cosaro's family business, Picnic Time, was started 43 years ago by his father, an Italian immigrant on a mission to sell high-quality picnic baskets. The company now sells a wide range of products, from coolers to beach chairs, to major retailers like Kohl's, Target and Macy's. Since Trump's new tariffs went into effect, Picnic Time had to freeze hiring and capital expenditures, limiting its ability to produce and release new products, Cosaro said.\"It absolutely has stifled innovation,\" he said. \"You don't want to take risks anymore ... there's no room for error.\"Cosaro said he attempted to move his supply chain to other countries during Trump's first term, hiring additional staff and conducting sourcing missions in India and Mexico. But years later, he was only able to move about 10% of production. He said he raised his prices earlier this year to account for the new tariffs and the third quarter has so far been \"very, very, very soft.\" Sales are down about 20% and key retailers have pulled back on orders. The holiday season is always important to Picnic Time, as it accounts for about 35% of annual revenue, but this year it feels like the company is putting \"all of our eggs in one basket,\" said Cosaro.\"For us, it's critically important,\" he said. \"We're literally going to be waiting until the last day of the year to find out if this is going to be a profitable year or not.\" For now, Cosaro said he will keep his supply chain primarily in China. He's considered moving some of it to the U.S., but said he doesn't have the budget available to take the risk. CitibinTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $67,883Total tariffs expected in 2025: $380,000Employees: 8Supply chain: 90% Vietnam, 5% China, 5% U.S. Frank Picarazzi, the chief operating officer of Citibin (left) with his wife Liz Picarazzi, the company's founder and CEO (right).Courtesy: Frank PicarazziWhen Liz Picarazzi first started Citibin, which makes rat-proof trash enclosures for cities, parks and homes, the company manufactured in the U.S. After a few years, she said she found U.S. producers couldn't meet her expectations on price, quality or lead time. She moved production to China and for several years, the business enjoyed manageable tariffs and reliable partners. However, in the lead-up to the 2024 election, she and her husband Frank Picarazzi, Citibin's COO, started looking for other options over concerns that either candidate would raise tariff rates.\"I told Frank two days after the election, 'we're going to Vietnam, like, as soon as we can,'\" Liz Picarazzi said.The couple spent the next few months moving most of their production to Vietnam, only to learn of Trump's decision to raise tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports to 50%. That raised costs for just about every product Citibin sells. Though her supply chain is now more diversified, Liz Picarazzi said that moving to Vietnam was \"somewhat pointless\" as a result.Meanwhile, she said higher costs are affecting talent retention, research and development, and revenue. The company has added a 15% tariff surcharge to products to offset the cost of tariffs. Frank Picarazzi said it has contributed to a 25% decline in sales to homeowners, which the company expects will account for about 50% of overall revenue this year. Reekon ToolsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $65,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: more than $400,000Employees: 20Supply chain: Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and China Christian Reed, founder and CEO of Reekon Tools, on a job site holding the T1R Hybrid Laser Tape MeasureHandoutResearch and development is critical for Christian Reed's tool startup Reekon. He said the company had to cut back R&D spending by 20% because of tariffs.\"This certainly put a thorn in the side of our hiring plan for the rest of the year around engineers for R&D activities,\" said Reed. \"That's something that will continue to have to either be paused or completely canceled if nothing changes.\"The hundreds of thousands of dollars Reed planned to use to hire between three and five designers and engineers is now going to tariffs instead, he said. The company, which makes innovative products like digital tape measures for tradespeople, needs to ensure every tool it produces is effective and able to withstand tough conditions on worksites.\"There's a unique combination of making a product that you can feed up, throw on the concrete, you know, slam around and not break, and at the same time add this digital aspect,\" said Reed. \"So that puts a very high burden on the testing, the research we have to do … it's a very costly product as most of the products we're making are new to [the] world.\"Reed said he's avoided raising prices on most items, choosing to take the hit to profit margins, but recently increased the price of a new tool – a smaller version of its digital tape measure. Initially, Reekon wanted to price it at $99 and while the margins would've been slim, the company expected to be able to make it up in volume, Reed said. However, after tariff rates rose, the company priced it at $119 when it launched in September to help it offset losses in other parts of the business. While the product has been well received, sales so far have fallen short of the company's projections. ",

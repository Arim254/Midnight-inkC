    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

    "body": "CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is interviewed for CNBC in the Russell Senate office building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 15, 2026. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersSenators are vowing to go forward on a major crypto bill that would give the industry the rule of the road after a planned committee vote was derailed at the 11th hour. But the biggest sticking points have been issues for months as Democrats, Republican, the crypto industry and banks have tried to find common ground. The likelihood that the latest version of the bill, which was released late Monday, would be able to get the approval of the Banking Committee was already tenuous when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that Coinbase would not be able to support the bill, listing several concerns including a reduced role for the CFTC and limits on the ability for crypto to offer consumers rewards in the bill.. \"It was the 1,000th cut in a death by 1000 cuts,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis told CNBC of Armstrong's tweet. A few hours after Armstrong publicly opposed the bill, Banking Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., formally called off the hearing, postponing it to a yet-to-be-announced date.  Armstrong told CNBC that after a new version of the bill was dropped late Monday night, he was surprised by some of the provisions in it. By the time Coinbase's team identified key areas of concern, it was too late for any changes to be made in a markup. \"We've got a chance to do a new draft and hopefully get back into a markup in a few weeks,\" Armstrong said.  Lummis, said it could take until February or March to re-hold the vote.  \"I feel like I got run over by a Mack truck,\" said Lummis, one of the biggest crypto proponents on Capitol Hill who has worked on similar legislation for years. \"But we'll get back at it after this break and find some ways to fix the bill.\" One of the biggest debates around the bill deals with the rewards that companies can offer stablecoin holders. Under the stablecoin law, crypto exchanges cannot offer customers interest on stablecoin – however they can offer rewards that act like interest. Banks have said the language could lead to hundreds of billions being moved from deposits to stablecoin – one Fed report suggests there could be a credit squeeze of hundreds of billion to as much as $1.2 trillion if stablecoin can offer interest.  Armstrong said he would like to speak with bank CEOs directly on this, but argued that the bill needed to treat both industries equally.  \"Crypto companies should be allowed to compete and offer loans just like banks,\" he said. Banks are also preparing to fight for more favorable language. More than 3,000 banks signed a petition lead by the American Bankers Association warning that allowing crypto to offer interest-like rewards \"will siphon trillions from local lending, leaving less money available for car loans, agricultural loans, mortgages, and small business borrowing that drive local economies.\" Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., said she's spoken with representatives from the banking and crypto industries, and she thinks if there is more time to negotiate, an agreement can be reached soon.\"Everyone agrees that there has to be a compromise somewhere in there, and making sure that we are allowing the innovation to grow,\" she said.Caleigh Keating contributed to this article.

    "body": "Signage outside the Mitsubishi Corp. head office in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Mitsubishi agreed to buy Aethon Energy Management LLC's US gas and pipeline assets for $5.2 billion, the biggest purchase by a Japanese company in the American shale sector. Photographer: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, \"from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,\" the company said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the press conference after his meeting with Polish PM Donald Tusk at Google for Startups Campus In Warsaw in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle on Friday filed to appeal a federal judge's ruling that the company held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.The appeal could result in a delay of remedies against the Alphabet-owned company while the legal process continues plays out. The 2024 ruling \"ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote in a Friday blog. \"The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,\" she wrote. The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and in August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. At the time, Google said it would likely appeal the decision.Last Spring, the company and the DOJ participated in a remedies trial to determine the the consequences Google would implement. The trial included witnesses from Apple and Mozilla, as well as competitors from OpenAI and other companies. In September 2025, Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. The ruling was seen as a win for Google, with its stock jumping 8% following the news. Mehta finalized the remedies in December. Mehta stipulated that Google must share some of its raw search interaction data that it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but he spared the company from having to share its actual algorithms. Mehta also wrote that Google cannot enter into any deals like the search agreement the company had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Analysts at the time compared the lighter-than-expected remedies to a slap on the wrist. Google is asking to pause the implementation of the remedies, Mulholland wrote on Friday. \"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products,\" Mulholland wrote. \"Ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology.\"WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabiswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowMicron stock rose nearly 8% Friday as investors looked to buy AI chip supply chain stocks after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported robust earnings on Thursday, signaling continued AI infrastructure spending.Shares of Micron, one of the makers of memory and storage for artificial intelligence systems, is up over 250% over the past year, as memory is in a worldwide shortage and seeing a surge of demand. Memory is used in AI systems to keep large amounts of data close to the graphics processing unit, or GPU, so it can run large AI models without slowing down.\"AI driven-demand is accelerating,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.\"Mehrotra said that Micron is spending $200 billion to build more production capacity in the U.S., including two fabrication plants, or fabs, in Idaho and a 600,000-foot facility in Clay, New York, where the company broke ground on Friday. Mehrotra said it will take a few years to build out the facilities, including clean rooms and production equipment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the groundbreaking. Micron said it would invest $100 billion in that fab.He added that Micron is also working to produce more chips in its existing facilities in the near term.At the beginning of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth for server memory, but that growth ended up being \"high teens\" by the end of the year. Mehrotra also said the company saw stronger-than-expected growth in memory and storage for PCs. \"We see that tightness continuing into 2027, so we see durable industry fundamentals over the foreseeable future, driven by AI demand,\" Mehrotra said.The rush to supply the memory demand of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google has led to a shortage, and prices for the essential component are expected to rise an estimated 55% in the first quarter, CNBC previously reported.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, in front of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., delivers remarks at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "Da-kuk | E+ | Getty ImagesAs many Americans struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living — housing, groceries, electricity and other necessities — their financial stress is getting more attention in the workplace.In 2025, employer discomfort at their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared with 43% in 2024 and only 39% in 2023, according to recent research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. As recently as 2019, the year before Covid, that share stood at 22%. Since 2022, \"we've seen employers shift away from retirement as the top area of concern toward more of the day-to-day cost of living issues, and budgeting and savings issues,\" said Jake Spiegel, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"Employees are feeling the squeeze from above-trend inflation,\" Spiegel said.Paycheck to paycheckAlthough inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.7% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.The result has been a large share of households whose budgets are pinched by higher costs. More than half (57%) of employees live paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2025 survey of close to 90,000 participants in 401(k) retirement plans by Bank of America. While wage growth has generally outpaced inflation over the past two years, that came after a period when income lagged behind inflation in 2021 and 2022.Employers, who are interested in helping employees manage stress in order to reduce absenteeism or worker dissatisfaction, have been doing more to focus on the financial well-being of their employees.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

The study included responses from 406 benefits decisionmakers at companies with at least 500 employees and that are either offering financial wellness programs or interested in doing so.At the same time, a smaller share of employers say their efforts are making a \"large impact\": 43%, compared with 60% in 2024 and 73% in 2023. Employers may be taking cues from their employees when assessing the impact of their programs, he said.\"We see evidence in one of our other surveys … that employees tend to be less rosy than employers when it comes to rating the effectiveness of benefits,\" he said.Financial wellness designThe specifics of any financial wellness program differ from company to company. They could include, for example, benefits like payroll advance loans, short-term loans through a third-party and access to emergency funds through dedicated savings accounts or their 401(k) — either through a loan or hardship withdrawal.Other times, it could include offering seminars or webinars that focus on specific issues like creating a budget, investing or saving for retirement.Also, 68% indicated that their workers have access to financial advisors and 46% offer access to financial coaches. Sometimes, the company subsidizes the cost either fully or partly for workers to meet with experts one-on-one.\"Financial wellness [programs] with one-on-one sessions are a strategic way to provide more access\" to professionals who specialize in providing financial guidance, said certified financial planner Uchechi Kalu, founder of Greenlight Financial Planning in Los Angeles.Kalu is working with a nonprofit in Chicago whose employees are able to meet with her twice annually, via video calls, about whatever financial issues they are facing. With the employer subsidizing half of the cost, workers pay $118 per session, Kalu said. She said that when employers help pay for these kinds of sessions, it can make a difference in whether workers make use of the benefit or not.She has provided guidance related to a variety of financial issues, including budgeting, investing, home buying and affording overseas travel.  \"The one-on-ones are when you get to reach people in critical moments and help them along their journey,\" Kalu said.",

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 8% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a \"solid start\" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said \"one data point does not make a trend.\" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess early demand for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug market. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said around 3,100 prescriptions for the Wegovy pill were filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. In the first week of the commercial launch of Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, around 1,300 prescriptions were filled, and roughly 8,000 were filled in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited somewhat different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. The analysts said that compares with the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill \"is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,\" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds \"significant promise\" for the pill's launch. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements — no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water — that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. watch now",

    "body": "Elon musk and the xAI logo.Vincent Feuray | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency closed a loophole this week that Elon Musk's xAI had exploited to rapidly stand up its first data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as \"non-road engines.\"The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above \"major source thresholds\" of pollution. The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process. Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's \"temporary\" turbines.SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention. Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environment Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they aren't violating terms of their permits, and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi. XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake violent and sexualized images of women and even children.WATCH: xAI closes $20 billion funding roundwatch now",

Bryan Derballa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmpire Wind will resume construction off the coast of New York, after a federal judge on Thursday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. The preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carl J. Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is the latest setback for President Donald Trump's efforts to stop offshore wind projects. Equinor, the Norwegian company developing Empire Wind, said it \"will now focus on safely restarting construction activities that were halted during the suspension period.\"\"In addition, the project will continue to engage with the U.S. government to ensure the safe, secure and responsible execution of its operations,\" Equinor said in a statement Thursday. The Department of Interior halted five wind projects off the East Coast, including Empire Wind, on Dec. 22 claiming national security concerns. Equinor in its lawsuit called the suspension \"the latest unlawful action\" by the Trump administration to stop the development of offshore wind.Empire Wind is expected to generate electricity for more than 500,000 homes by 2027, according to Equinor. It will provide power to New York City through a substation in Brooklyn. The other projects targeted by Trump are Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, and Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England. A federal judge on Monday allowed Revolution Wind to resume construction. A hearing on the suspension of Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m. ET at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Norfolk. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, owned by Dominion Energy, is the largest project of its kind in the U.S. ",

    "body": "A sign is displayed at the Department of Labor Frances Perkins Building on June, 2025, in Washington.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesA controversial social media post from the Department of Labor has poured gasoline on already smoldering accusations that the Trump administration is amplifying rhetoric and imagery linked to extreme right-wing ideologies.The video in the post, shared Saturday, features a quick-cut slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history, foregrounded by a statue of George Washington.The caption above that video reads, \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.\"Social media users quickly noted similarities — in word, form and sentiment — between the Labor Department's post and a slogan used by the Nazi Party.\"US Government posting a version of 'Ein volk, ein reich, ein führer,'\" said Terry Virts, a former NASA astronaut and current Democratic congressional candidate, in an X post. \"I don't see how this ends well.\"The slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\" translates to \"One People, One Country, One Leader.\" It was \"one of the central slogans used by Hitler and the Nazi Party,\" according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.The two messages are not a word-for-word match, to be sure. But while experts caution against jumping to conclusions, many see numerous other examples of the Trump administration — including the Labor Department — echoing white supremacist language, ideas or aesthetics online.Bill Braniff, executive director of American University's Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, said he believes that, \"When you look at this one post in the context of all the others, it's not an accident.\"Even at face value, the post raises red flags, Braniff said in an interview. The assertion of Americans having \"one heritage,\" for instance, clashes with the nation's history of taking in people from all over the world and establishes the idea of an \"in group\" and an \"out group,\" he said.Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, agreed.\"You don't want to try and ever read into the tea leaves on something that might not be there,\" he told CNBC. But \"at a certain point, you have to ask how many times until it's not a coincidence anymore.\"\"At a certain point, you can't even really call it a dog whistle, it's just a whistle,\" Lewis added in an email. \"How many times will official [U.S. government] accounts post openly white supremacist content without any repercussions?\"The Labor Department, led by Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. A spokesperson for the department previously said, \"The social media campaign was created to celebrate American workers and the American Dream.\"That comment was given in response to The Guardian's report on union leaders denouncing the Labor Department over the post.\"It is no surprise that a fascist regime would post fascist propaganda on a fascist social media network like X, but it remains concerning to see the DOL making posts that serve a fascist, white supremacist agenda,\" Puneet Maharaj, executive director of National Nurses United, the country's largest nurses' union, told the outlet. A trail of accusations President Donald Trump arrives for a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 15, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesLabor's post is hardly the first time the Trump administration has been accused of spreading far-right or white nationalist propaganda through social media. But in recent weeks, the government has appeared to double down on some of the same controversial messaging.On Wednesday, ahead of diplomatic talks on President Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive efforts to acquire Greenland, the White House shared a possibly AI-generated cartoon showing two dog sleds at a crossroads, with one path leading to the U.S. and the other leading to Russia and China.\"Which way, Greenland man?\" read the text above that image, which was posted on the White House's official X account.Critics have accused the account of echoing \"Which Way Western Man?,\" the title of a 1978 book defending Hitler and advocating for a white nationalist and antisemitic worldview. The book was written by William Gayley Simpson, said to be a member of neo-Nazi group the National Alliance.The phrase in recent years has gained popularity on the far right. It has been used in memes in which an image purporting to represent modern society is contrasted unfavorably with an image representing tradition.The White House's post wasn't the first time a version of the phrase had appeared on government social media accounts. Five months earlier, the Department of Homeland Security had posted an ICE recruitment image captioned, \"Which way, American man?\" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin at the time called reporters' questions about that post \"embarrassing.\"In response to questions about the posts from the White House and Labor Department accounts, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC, \"It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: the deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda. This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.\"On Jan. 8, the Labor Department posted a photo of a saluting Trump under the words \"trust the plan\" — a recurring phrase among followers of the far-right conspiracy known as QAnon.Last Friday, DHS' official accounts posted an ICE recruitment image declaring, \"We'll have our home again.\"That phrase echoes the title of the song \"By God We'll Have Our Home Again,\" the lyrics of which have been \"credited to a U.S. fraternal neo-Nazi group,\" according to the Toronto Holocaust Museum's Hatepedia.McLaughlin, asked on CNN about DHS' use of the phrase, accused critics of \"manufacturing fake outrage.\"\"There are plenty of poems, there are plenty of songs, there are plenty of books with the same title. And the fact that people would like to cherry-pick something of white nationalism ... it's no wonder we're seeing such vast, rampant assaults against our law enforcement,\" she said.The DHS post, which also featured a stealth bomber and a cowboy riding horseback at the foot of a snowy mountain, came two days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good during an altercation in Minneapolis.The Southern Poverty Law Center said that the administration's turn toward allegedly white nationalist content on government social media channels may have begun last June, when DHS shared a cartoon of Uncle Sam calling on Americans to \"report all foreign invaders\" to ICE. Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeSome of the most scrutinized posts have generated the heaviest engagement online. The Labor Department post from last weekend, for example, has tallied nearly 23 million views on X alone, possibly making it the account's most-seen post.But they fit into a broader messaging strategy that frequently promotes images and slogans evoking classic wartime propaganda posters and idealized depictions of Americana and U.S. history.The Labor Department has recently taken to sharing historical paintings captioned with, at times, overtly Christian messages. It also recently launched a social media campaign featuring AI-seeming illustrations of almost exclusively white men.In November, the family of famed 20th century painter Norman Rockwell accused DHS of misusing their ancestor's work \"for the cause of persecution toward immigrant communities and people of color.\"Some extremism experts say the messaging has become overt.One way to know that, said Braniff, is that \"the neo-Nazis themselves have noticed\" and are talking about the administration's rhetoric.Other extremism experts and scholars of fascism have also noticed, as have the union leaders who have called out the Labor Department, he added. \"It has to do with both the frequency of content coming out, but also the backdrop,\" Braniff said. \"It seems quite overt at this point.\"",

Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visits \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" at Fox Business Network Studios in New York on Dec. 4, 2024.Mike Coppola | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kick-start a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta. \"It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay, so we are are hopeful a business model like this can work,\" Altman wrote in a post on X on Friday.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseAds within ChatGPT will appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers, and they will be clearly labeled, OpenAI said. ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will \"never\" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. \"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

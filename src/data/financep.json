    "body": "The Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNasdaq is moving closer to around-the-clock stock trading, a shift that some on Wall Street are calling unnecessary — and potentially destabilizing.The exchange said it plans to submit paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow U.S.-listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week. If approved, the new schedule would launch in the second half of 2026.Under the proposal, Nasdaq would expand trading hours to 23 hours each weekday from the current 16 hours. Stocks would trade in a \"day session\" from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, followed by a one-hour pause for maintenance, testing and clearing. A \"night session\" would then run from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. the following morning.Critics argue that formalizing nearly nonstop trading could worsen some of the very problems that plague the structure of equity markets today — thin liquidity, sharp price swings and an increasingly \"gamified\" trading environment.'Worst thing in the world'\"This is literally the worst thing in the world,\" the Wells Fargo trading desk wrote in a note to clients. \"I cannot think of an action that single-handedly gamifies the stock market even more than it has already become. This is the epitome of making trading even more like gambling.\"Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and a former market maker on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, raised concerns about the impact on listed companies themselves.\"Listed companies need a time to break and release news events and to have meetings where they're not moving markets, and now we're taking that away from them,\" Woods said. \"You're opening up a new can of worms.\"Nasdaq currently operates three weekday sessions: pre-market trading from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., the regular session from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and after-hours trading from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.Retail-focused brokers, including Robinhood, have already rolled out extended or near-24-hour trading for certain U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies, responding to demand from individual investors who want the ability to trade on global news at any time.The New York Stock Exchange is pursuing its own extended-hours model, with plans for 22 hours of weekday trading that won initial SEC approval in February, contingent on data-feed upgrades.Liquidity clusterWells Fargo added that most liquidity already clusters around the market open and close, making the idea of stretching trading hours even further counterproductive. \"Most of the complaints that I hear on market structure are about how bad volumes are as most comes in around the open and close,\" the note said. \"And the industry move is to then elongate the trading day even further? This makes no sense at all.\"While Nasdaq says extended hours could eventually attract more participation, skeptics ask whether firms would be forced to staff trading desks around the clock.\"We know between 9:30 and 4, most traders are at their desk. The biggest institutions are working,\" Woods said. \"Are we going to have to add a whole new ecosphere of traders and institutions to man the desks so they can participate around the clock?\"Woods believes pauses in trading serve a purpose, enabling markets to digest information and participants to reset.\"We take breaks for a reason,\" Woods said. \"Let's recharge the batteries. Let's all get on the same page. We already have volatility ... during the day. If things move too far, too fast, we take a pause.\"",

    "body": "Honda vehicles are lined up at a vehicle storage yard at an industrial port, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump struck a trade deal with Japan that lowers tariffs on auto imports, in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Japan, July 23, 2025. Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersJapan's exports in November rose at their fastest rate in nine months this year, growing at 6.1% year on year, data from the country's finance ministry released Wednesday showed.   The growth sharply beat expectations of an average 4.8% rise estimated by economists polled by Reuters, and was higher than the 3.6% seen in the previous month.  The export numbers were supported by a 23.6% increase in goods shipped to Western Europe, as well as an 8.8% rise in exports to the U.S., its second largest trading partner. This marks the first time that exports to the U.S. from Japan have increased since March.Exports of automobiles fell 4.1% by value, but auto shipments to the U.S. posted a recovery, rising 1.5% year in year in November. The data comes after revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that Japan's economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis. Shipments to mainland China fell 2.4%, but exports to Hong Kong jumped 11.4% compared to the same period the previous year. Exports of \"foodstuff\" to mainland China fell 5.9% by value. In November, tensions between Japan and China rose after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could trigger an intervention by Japan's military, leading to Beijing restricting imports of Japanese seafood. Imports into Japan rose 1.3% in November, compared to expectations of a 2.5% rise. Trade and diplomatic frictions aside, Japanese companies are positive on business growth, with the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing that sentiment among Japanese companies mostly improved in the fourth quarter, especially among small manufacturers.Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, highlighted the growth in semiconductor and equipment exports, saying that the U.S.-led boom in tech spending is translating into growing exports of specialized machinery and equipment.Exports of electrical machinery jumped 7.4%, and semiconductor-related exports surged 13% year on year, which Koll said is a \"confirmation of Japan's competitiveness in supplying machines that make machines.\"The market is underestimating the positive implications of the U.S. capex boom, much of what goes into the new data centers and AI hardware enablers and power centers is Made in Japan, and can only be made in Japan,\" Koll added.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stateside designated Venezuelan government a \"terrorist\" organization and ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said \"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"\"For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" Trump said.He added, \"It [the blockade] will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\"Venezuela labeled Trump's statement \"grotesque,\" saying his action \"violates International Law, free trade and free navigation, which constitutes a serious threat against a sovereign nation,\" calling the blockade \"absolutely irrational,\" according to a Google translation of Venezuelan media reports. According to the U.S. State Department, designating an entity as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to knowingly provide \"material support or resources\" to such an organization, among other measures. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNBC that a full embargo of Venezuelan oil would affect 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of oil per day, which could increase prices by about $2 to $3 per barrel. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThat would still leave the world \"well supplied\" as there's a global oil surplus of about 2 million barrels per day, Lipow said. However, Lipow also pointed out that \"The oil market will be watching the Chinese reaction as they are the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, benefiting from discounted prices and, they may be reluctant to observe USA sanctions, keeping Venezuelan oil flowing into the market.\"Brent crude rose 0.9% to $59.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 1% to $55.82 a barrel after after the news. Prices had hit a four-year low on Tuesday stateside, with WTI falling nearly 3% to $55.27 per barrel, while Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92.Lipow's view was also echoed by Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, who said that \"nothing substantively has changed,\" as long as only sanctioned tankers are targeted.\"We estimate that sanctioned (only) tankers would threaten about 0.3 million barrels of Venezuela's roughly 0.9 million barrels a day of total crude exports.\"McNally said that this alone is not enough to impart a sustained spike into crude prices, which are beginning to fall as surpluses emerge.The Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in recent months, saying that his \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico. Trump has categorically not ruled out a ground invasion of the South American nation.The White House has reportedly undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean, including deploying its largest aircraft carrier to the region, as well as launching strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S.— CNBC's Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Shoppers walk past shops on Regent Street on the final weekday before Christmas in London on December 22, 2023.Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.K.'s inflation rate cooled sharply to 3.2% in November, boosting the chances of the Bank of England cutting interest rates at its final meeting of the year on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had expected inflation to stand at 3.5% in the twelve months to November — the lowest annual rate since March — and down from 3.6% in October. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, also rose by 3.2% in the year to November, down from 3.4% in October, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.Lower food prices, which traditionally rise in the run up to Christmas, were the main driver of the fall, with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals, ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner commented Wednesday.watch now\"Tobacco prices also helped pull the rate down, with prices easing slightly this month after a large rise a year ago. The fall in the price of women's clothing was another downward driver,\" Fitzner said in comments on X.While the rise in the cost of goods leaving factories slowed, the annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to rise, he added.Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the drop in the inflation rate but said there is \"more work to do.\"\"I know families across Britain who are worried about the cost of living will welcome this fall in inflation. But there is more to do,\" she said on X.Christmas rate cutThe data, coming after a print on Tuesday showing the U.K. unemployment rate rose 5.1%, is likely to encourage the Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% when it meets on Thursday. Economists expect a 5-4 vote by the central bank's MPC, however, with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey expected to be the swing vote in favor of a trim.Growth in the U.K. remains stubbornly low, with the economy eking out only a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter, according to the most recent data, and signs that unemployment could be ticking higher. \"These figures, alongside the recent deluge of downbeat data, mean that an interest rate cut tomorrow looks certain,\" Suren Thiru, economics director at the ICAEW, said after the inflation data. \"While the financial squeeze on households and businesses remains severe, these figures offer reassurance that the U.K. is moving towards a more modest inflation environment, helped by lower food prices,\" he noted in emailed comments.\"The growing downward pressure from a loosening labour market and wilting economy should help keep it on a downward path,\" he said.

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate last week, and just as happened the last two times, mortgage rates rose. That caused demand for home loans and refinances to drop.Total mortgage application volume fell 3.8% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, 806,500 or less, increased to 6.38% from 6.33%, with points increasing to 0.62 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.\"Mortgage rates inched up last week following the FOMC meeting, as investors interpreted the comments to signal that we are near the end of this rate cutting cycle. As a result, mortgage applications declined slightly,\" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's SVP and chief economist in a release.Applications to refinance a home loan fell 4% for the week and were 86% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, the rate on the 30-year fixed was 37 basis points higher. While that is not a huge difference, borrowers who may have taken out a loan two years ago, when rates were well over 7%, could now benefit from a refinance.

This followed new government data on the employment picture. Markets are still waiting for government data on inflation expected Thursday. \"This is the heaviest hitting monthly inflation report and inflation is the other half of the Fed's rate-setting equation,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.

    "body": "watch nowFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC on Wednesday that he will \"absolutely\" emphasize the importance of central bank independence to President Donald Trump.Waller is one of five finalists to potentially succeed Jerome Powell when the Federal Reserve chairman's term ends in May. He is scheduled to have an interview with Trump on Wednesday. \"Absolutely,\" Waller said when asked by CNBC's Steve Liesman whether he would emphasize Fed independence during his interview with the president.\"I spent 20 years of my life working on central bank independence and why it was important,\" he said at the Yale CEO Summit. \"I have a long paper trail on this.\" Trump regularly weighs in on Fed decisions, accusing the central bank of moving too slowly to cut interest rates. The president has been a harsh critic of Powell and has mused publicly about firing him before his term is up. This has raised fears among some investors that Trump will try to install a pliant ally as Fed chair after Powell leaves the central bank. But Waller said Trump already makes his views about Fed decisions clear on Truth Social, leaving no confusion about where the president stands on monetary policy.  The biweekly breakfast between the Fed chair and Treasury Secretary is the appropriate venue for communication between the White House and the central bank rather than face-to-face meetings with the president, Waller said. Waller told CNBC that he views rates as still 50 to 100 basis points above a neutral rate that is not stimulative or restrictive.  \"We still got some room that we could bring things down,\" Waller said. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been viewed as the front-runner to succeed Powell, though some high-level people close to Trump have pushed back on his candidacy. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh is also on the short list. \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great,\" Trump told The Wall Street Journal last week. ",

Global benchmark Brent was trading at $59.96, up $1.04 or 1.77%.

Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil, 5 yearsBut Trump's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has lifted prices from those lows. The president said he ordered a \"total and complete\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers leaving and entering Venezuela. Trump's blockade comes after the U.S. seized a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela's coast last week in a major escalation. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.  It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year, with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.",

This is what to expect:European Central BankThe ECB is expected to keep rates on hold, with recent economic data not pointing to an adjustment.But investors will be more interested in any commentary on the apparent growing tensions inside the governing council, with some members, like Isabel Schnabel, openly endorsing the market's view that the next rate move will be a hike, while others think there is still room to cut. Christian Kopf, who heads the bond portfolio management of German asset manager Union Investment, told CNBC: \"I don't expect and rate change in the Euro area for the time being. If there is a change in 2026, most likely we will get a rate hike towards the end of 2026 or at the beginning of 2027.\"The ECB is expected to hike its growth outlook for the Eurozone when publishing its new round of staff projections, its in-house economic forecasts.CNBC will be covering the ECB's monetary policy decision from 1 p.m. London time, with guests including   Lorenzo Codogno, founder of Lorenzo Codogno Macro Advisors, and Al Cattermole, Fixed Income portfolio manager at Mirabaud Asset Management.Norges BankNorway's central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold at 4% on Thursday, with economists suggesting the next rate cut might not come until summer 2026. Norges Bank announces its policy decision at 10 a.m. local time, 9 a.m. London time.Morten Lund, Scandinavia chief economist at JPMorgan, commented that the bank's guidance on Thursday \"should be a push-back against markets' rising expectations\" that it will cut rates in March, which he said was currently seen as \"a coin toss.\"Norges BankTomm W. Christiansen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstead, JPMorgan expects a rate cut to next take place in June, although Norges Bank was unlikely to be explicit about the timing of a cut.\"Forward guidance should remain vague, stating that 'if the economy evolves broadly as currently projected, the policy rate will be reduced further in the course of the coming year'. We also think that the Governor will say that inflation remains too high and repeat the sentence that \"we are not in a hurry to reduce the policy rate',\" Lund added. CNBC will be interviewing Ida Wolden Bache, the governor of Norges Bank, at 12.10 p.m. London time, 1.10 p.m. CET. Riksbank Sweden's central bank is expected to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 1.75% when it announces its decision at 9.30 a.m. CET, 8.30 a.m. London time.No change is likely in the coming quarters either, according to Franziska Fischer at UBS Investment Bank, who said that the Riksbank's easing cycle was over.The Swedish flag hangs on the country's central bank.Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images\"The Riksbank cut the policy rate by 25 basis points in September but remained on hold in November, while signalling that the policy rate will likely remain unchanged 'for some time to come',\" Fischer said.Developments since November do not warrant a change to the rate outlook, in UBS' view, he added. CNBC will be interviewing Erik Thedeen, Riksbank governor, on Thursday at 1.20 p.m. CET, 12:20 p.m. London time. Bank of England The Bank of England is the only central bank that's expected to cut interest rates on Thursday, with a small majority of the bank's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) expected to opt for a 25 basis points cut, bringing the base rate down to 3.75%.Expectations of a cut rose after the latest inflation data showed it fell sharply to 3.2% in November, and recent downbeat economic data in the U.K., ranging from somber growth figures to an uptick in unemployment.

    "body": "watch nowRobinhood is stepping up the capabilities of its fastest growing product — prediction markets — by giving users the ability to place what are essential parlay bets on multiple NFL games, putting it into direct competition with traditional sports books.Starting Tuesday, users are able to trade preset combinations of the outcome, totals and spreads of individual NFL games, and starting in early 2026, users will have the ability to create custom combos of up to 10 outcomes across NFL games. Those will have \"a structural look or feel as a parlay,\" JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at Robinhood, told CNBC.Even more, the company is allowing users to wager on the performances of individual NFL players in real time. For example, they can place prop bets on a certain player scoring a touchdown at any point during a game as well as the passing, receiving and rushing yards for a player.\"This was a great opportunity for us to really be able to become the leader in the space, and that's what we're working to do,\" Mackenzie said. \"The enhancements here are another example of it, where we're trying to build new customer experiences that make it easier and, in some cases, provide them more advanced order types and trading capabilities to meet the needs that they're asking us for.\"The new features were unveiled at the company's \"Robinhood Presents: YES/NO\" keynote event at the Summit Skywalker Ranch in Nicasio, Calif., right outside San Francisco.The parlay capability may even extend beyond the NFL in the future, according to Robinhood. The broker is also looking at opportunities to allow combos across different event categories, including those outside of sports like economic data.Parlaying non-sports events\"Over time, the question is going to be, 'Is there interest to pair assets from different classes together?'\" Mackenzie said, noting \"something that's associated with climate and an election\" as an example. \"All sporting events are definitely on the radar. I also think that domestic and international economic data is going to be on there as well, as well as domestic and international policy.\"Robinhood's involvement with prediction markets began just before the 2024 presidential election, where it gave users the ability to trade a contract of former Vice President Kamala Harris or President Donald Trump.In a little more than a year since it partnered with ForecastEx for election trading, the company has only expanded its presence in the prediction markets ecosystem. It has partnered with prediction market operator Kalshi this year. More recently, it announced a joint venture with Susquehanna International Group in November.Robinhood has been seeing the fruits of its labor. Prediction markets as a business has already brought in $100 million in annualized revenue with 11 billion contracts traded by more than 1 million customers. Based on October figures, it's on pace to become a $300 million business.November was the business's biggest month to date at more than 3 billion contracts traded, signifying an approximately 20% increase from October. That month saw 2.5 billion contracts traded, which is more than the entirety of the year's third-quarter performance at 2.3 billion contracts. \"I actually think we're at the beginning of where this is really going to go,\" Mackenzie said. \"I think that we're going to continue to see the expansion of new not only events but also asset classes, where people can continue to trade in.\"Gen-Z's SchwabEarlier this year, Piper Sandler said that Robinhood's prediction markets business posed a \"significant\" growth opportunity for the company, and they're not the only ones that are optimistic. Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said the strong desire among Robinhood users to interact with prediction markets presents \"lots of upside.\" In a recent survey, he found that users of Robinhood and Coinbase – another platform – are about nine times more likely than non-users to partake in prediction markets.\"They're going after a user base that's already predisposed to engaging with prediction markets,\" he said in an interview with CNBC. \"Over time, they're going to become sort of a hub for prediction markets.\"Dolev said Robinhood's move into prediction markets is a main reason the stock has soared a monstrous 220% in 2025.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHOOD, year-to-dateHowever, the analyst underscored that prediction markets isn't the only thing to watch for the company. With its involvement in other areas like retirement, he forecasts that Robinhood will eventually become \"the new Schwab for Gen Z.\"To put that into perspective, Robinhood's assets under custody for the full 2024 year stood at $193 billion. Charles Schwab's total client assets were at $10.10 trillion in the same period.\"Prediction marks is one aspect,\" he continued. \"They're circling around every aspect of someone's financial life.\"KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Alex Markgraff concurs. He said that a number of the company's other endeavors, including its advisory business and its highly in-demand gold card, are in the \"early stages of scaling.\"\"In the short term, [prediction markets is] certainly an area where you might have sort of an outsized growth contribution just based on the apparent appetite for event contracts across the landscape of consumer retail trading,\" he said to CNBC. \"Nonetheless, [there are] multiple sources of growth, in our opinion.\"",

    "body": "Waymo co-CEOs (L-R): Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri DolgovWaymoSelf-driving car company Waymo is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding in the new year.The robotaxi company plans to raise billions from Alphabet, its parent company, as well as outside investors at a valuation as high as $110 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The latest funding discussions are indicative of Waymo's status as the leader of the pack in the U.S. robotaxi market. The company has been spending heavily to ramp up its fleet and continue expanding to more regions. Waymo is now either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles in 26 markets, in the U.S. and abroad.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo will \"meaningfully\" contribute to Alphabet's financials as soon as 2027, CNBC reported Tuesday.  If the Google sister company winds up raising as much as $15 billion, that would represent more than double the amount of its last funding round. That was a series C round of $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation, which closed in October 2024. Alphabet had committed $5 billion in a multiyear investment to Waymo at the time.That round was led by Alphabet alongside previous backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. At the time, Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said the funding would go toward expanding its robotaxi service.Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in the Austin, San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that Waymo crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company in December said it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.The company plans to open service next year in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Waymo also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark the company's first overseas service region.Amazon's Zoox this year began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December.Fundraising plans were first reported by The Information.WATCH: 2025: The year that the robotaxi went mainstream with Waymo leading the packwatch now",

    "body": "Narumon Bowonkitwanchai | Moment | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits soared nearly 700% in their market debut in Shanghai on Wednesday, after the company raised nearly $600 million in its initial public offering.Shares, which were priced at 104.66 yuan in the IPO, closed at 829 yuan on debut, marking a 692% jump.Similar to Moore Threads, which saw a robust debut at the start of the month, MetaX develops graphics processing units for artificial intelligence applications, tapping into a fast-growing sector driven by rising adoption of AI services.MetaX is part of a growing cohort of local chipmakers building AI processors, reflecting Beijing's push to reduce dependence on U.S. chips following Washington's tech curbs on export of high-end technology to China. Washington has imposed export curbs on U.S. chip behemoth Nvidia, barring sales of its most advanced AI chips to China. Newer Chinese players such as Enflame Technology and Biren Technology have also entered the AI space, aiming to capture a share of the billions in graphics processing unit, or GPU, demand no longer served by Nvidia. Chinese regulators have also been clearing more semiconductor IPOs in their drive for greater AI independence.watch nowEarlier this month, shares of Moore Threads, a Beijing-based GPU manufacturer often referred to as \"China's Nvidia,\" soared by more than 400% on its debut in Shanghai following its $1.1 billion listing.Macquarie's equity analyst Eugene Hsiao said investor enthusiasm around Chinese AI-chip IPOs such as MetaX is partly shaped by longer-term expectations that China will build a self-sufficient semiconductor ecosystem as tensions with the U.S. persist.\"For that to work, you need these players. You need names like Moore Threads, Meta X, etc,\" he said.\"So I think when investors are looking at these IPOs, they implicitly are thinking about the nationalistic element,\" Hsiao noted, adding that the main driver of the frenzy, however, was the firms' growth potential.— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Tesla electric vehicles (EV) in front of the company's store in Colma, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA California administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla's marketing around its \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" systems was deceptive, and that the company should face a 30-day suspension of each of its licenses to sell and manufacture cars in the state, according the California Department of Motor Vehicles.The California DMV made formal accusations of false advertising against Tesla in 2022. Steve Gordon, the agency's director, said in a press conference on Tuesday that his agency has adopted the judge's order with a modified penalty, and will now give Elon Musk's automaker a chance to fix any deceptive or confusing claims about its Autopilot and FSD systems. If the marketing issues aren't resolved within a 60-day window, the DMV will move ahead with a 30-day suspension of Tesla's license to sell cars in the state, the agency said in a statement. However, Gordon said, the DMV will stay the judge's order for a suspension of Tesla's manufacturing license, so there will be no interruption to the company's factory operations in the state.In 2022, the DMV said that Tesla's marketing of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems had suggested its cars could be operated autonomously, though they actually required an attentive driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Since that time, Tesla has changed the name of its premium, driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving (Supervised). \"A reasonable consumer likely would believe that a vehicle with Full Self-Driving Capability can travel safely without a human driver's constant, undivided attention,\" the judge wrote in the proposed order. \"This belief is wrong — both as a technological matter and as a legal matter — which makes the name Full Self-Driving Capability misleading,\" a violation of both civil and vehicle codes in California.Public relations firm FGS Global said in an emailed statement from Tesla that, \"This was a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.\"The California DMV did not cite consumer complaints in its accusations. However, Tesla is facing a class action lawsuit in California's Northern District from drivers who say that the company misled them for years regarding the self-driving capabilities of their Tesla electric vehicles.Tesla's stock price closed at a record on Tuesday, largely due to increased enthusiasm on Wall Street surrounding the company's plans for its Robotaxis and driverless technology.WATCH: Why EVs have worse depreciation rateswatch now",

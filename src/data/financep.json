But, the winter slate is poised to deliver a consistent spark of ticket sales, pushing the 2025 domestical haul above $9 billion and toward a post-pandemic high, according to the latest estimates.</p><p>\"The box office year-to-date domestically is running about 4% ahead of last year and, if we can expand on that lead, we could be looking at the biggest post-pandemic year for movies,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.</p><p>Heading into the fourth quarter, the domestic box office has tallied $6.5 billion in ticket sales this year, up from $6.3 billion a year prior, according to data from Comscore. The full-year record the box office is looking to surpass is $9.05 billion, which was tallied in 2023.</p><p>Analysts at Macquarie foresee <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/\">Disney's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"Tron: Ares\" as the first domino to fall, creating momentum throughout the rest of the year. Then comes <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CMCSA/\">Universal's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"Wicked: For Good\" and Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" both of which Macquarie expects to top $250 million in domestic ticket sales. The year is capped with \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"</p><p>\"Fall typically sees its ups and downs, but the trifecta formed by 'Wicked: For Good,' 'Zootopia 2,' and 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' during the holiday season cannot be overstated in its significance,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"Plenty of other films will contribute to the aggregate numbers as crucial counter-programmers and mid-range tentpoles.\"</p><p>These other releases include Universal's \"Black Phone 2,\" Disney and 20th Studio's \"Predator: Badlands,\" <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PSKY/\">Paramount's</a><span><span></span></span></span> \"The Running Man\" and Universal's \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2.\"</p><p>Eric Handler of Roth Capital Partners projects the fourth-quarter box office to reach $2.5 billion, which would be a 7% jump year over year. That would put full-year revenue at close to $9.1 billion, 5% higher than 2024. </p><p>Macquarie's expectations are even higher, with the financial group estimating $2.7 billion for the quarter and a $9.2 billion year.</p><p>\"And we expect the box office will grow further in 2026, driven by spillover from 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' and a slate of blockbusters and popular IP such as 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,' 'The Mandalorian and Grogu,' 'Toy Story 5,' 'Minions 3,' 'Moana,' 'Spider-Man: Brand New Day,' 'Avengers: Doomsday,' and 'Dune: Part Three,'\" Macquarie's team wrote.</p><p><em>Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.</em></p></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Peter Lynch, Fidelity Funds Advisory Board Member.</p><p>CNBC</p></div><div><p>Legendary investor <a href=\"https://link.cnbc.com/public/31279740\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lynch</a> built a reputation for routinely beating the market while overseeing Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 1980s. Decades later, he has some advice for the next generation of investors.</p><p>The artificial intelligence boom has dominated the market for the past three years, but Lynch, who averaged a 29.2% annual return in his 13 years at the helm of Magellan until 1990, has been happy to watch from the sidelines.</p><p>\"I have zero AI stocks,\" Lynch said on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIlurDigZcY\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Compound and Friends\"</a> podcast with investor <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/josh-brown/\">Josh Brown</a> . \"I literally couldn't pronounce <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> until about eight months ago.\"</p><p>Lynch, who famously claimed that at one time <a href=\"https://thelynchfoundation.com/peterlynch\" target=\"_blank\">1 out of every 100 Americans had a stake in Fidelity Magellan</a>, on the podcast addressed his career, the lessons he's learned along the way and, yes, today's craze for everything tied to artificial intelligence. Here are five of the biggest takeaways:</p><h3>Sitting out AI</h3><p>Megacap tech stocks have skyrocketed since the introduction of <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&utm_campaign=GOOG_C_SEM_GBR_Core_CHT_BAU_ACQ_PER_MIX_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_091724&utm_term=chatgpt&utm_content=169187630042&utm_ad=713941893301&utm_match=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21714513245&gbraid=0AAAAA-IW-UXxJOvlrH5weOlPYvA7ekZM_&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Y3HBhCxARIsAN7931WRYGacXttcAl74xMh8Xp6yvqGLD8SrPQ-cS5NQr_94Kj_6TscBZwwaAgZnEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> in late 2022, leading many on Wall Street to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/another-mark-moving-ai-chip-deal-reason-to-buy-or-is-this-just-more-money-going-in-a-circle.html\">question</a> if the AI trade is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Asked if  investors have chased the AI trade too far, Lynch said he had \"no idea.\"</p><p>Lynch said he doesn't understand technology enough to have an informed opinion on the market's optimism toward AI.</p><p>\"I'm the lowest tech guy ever,\" he said. \"I can't do anything with computers. I just have yellow pads.\"</p><p>Lynch declined to discuss his current portfolio or the stocks he likes at the moment, citing rules from Fidelity.</p><h3>Why you don't 'play the market'</h3><p>Lynch has long advocated that investors have a deep understanding of the companies they invest in. It's a core tenet of his book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Up-Wall-Street-Already/dp/0743200403\" target=\"_blank\">One Up on Wall Street</a>.\"</p><p>\"I have this expression: 'Know what you own,''' Lynch said. \"If you don't understand what you own, you're toast.\"</p><p>Lynch said people will spend hours researching flights to ensure they get the best price. But when it comes to investing, he said \"they'll put $10,000 in some crazy stock they heard on the bus.\"</p><p>He described the phrase \"play the market\" as \"awful\" and \"dangerous.\" Instead, Lynch said people should buy good companies and have an awareness of what they do.</p><p>Lynch said that the average variation in a typical New York Stock Exchange security in any given year is 100%, so investors need to know what to do when big moves happen.</p><h3>Entering after the first inning</h3><p>While the conventional wisdom is to buy stocks before they take off, Lynch cautioned against scorning all investment ideas just because a security has already rallied.</p><p>\"Sometimes, you don't have to be in the first inning,\" Lynch said.</p><p>As an example, Lynch pointed to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/\">McDonald's</a><span><span></span></span></span>, which he was told long ago had already seen rapid domestic growth. The hamburger chain went on to see strong growth when it expanded internationally.</p><p>\"People said 'McDonald's is done,'\" Lynch said. \"They just simply didn't think it through.\"</p><h3>Investment advantages today</h3><p>Today's investors have \"cushions\" that didn't exist before the <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-depression\" target=\"_blank\">Great Depression</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/great-depression-and-world-war-ii-1929-1945/franklin-delano-roosevelt-and-the-new-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">New Deal</a>, according to Lynch.</p><p>Lynch named unemployment insurance, Social Security benefits and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission helping everyday people over time. He also highlighted the active role of the Federal Reserve in recent decades. </p><p>Investors today benefit from \"so many things that are better,\" Lynch said, noting more market and economic \"buffers\" than existed in the past.</p><p>Lynch said investors have frequently braced for an economic collapse on the order of the 1930s. But none of the market tests since then, even the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/global_economy/policyresponses.html\" target=\"_blank\">Global Financial Crisis</a> in 2008-2009, have had the same downward intensity.</p><p>\"We had many opportunities to have a 'big one,'\" Lynch said. \"We've had some probably bad presidents, some bad congresses, we've had bad economists, and we've made it through.\"</p><h3>Future of work</h3><p>Lynch reassured workers who wonder if they will lose their jobs to AI.</p><p>In the early 1980s,about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System#:~:text=The%20Bell%20System%20was%20a,employed%20over%20one%20million%20people.\" target=\"_blank\">one million people</a> worked for <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/T/\">AT&T</a><span><span></span></span></span> alone at a time when the entire labor force <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/269959/employment-in-the-united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">stood at about 100 million</a>. Even as the telecom sector has grown, Lynch said the leading companies today employ about 400,000 workers. </p><p>Today, the U.S. workforce itself has swelled <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">past 160 million jobs</a>. Americans can probably count on expansion in some sectors to help offset elimination tied to technological advances or automation in others.</p><p>Lynch's comments come as executives at companies ranging from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Walmart</a><span><span></span></span></span> to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CSA-FF/\">Accenture</a><span><span></span></span></span> have warned that artificial intelligence will <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/29/walmart-ceo-ai-is-literally-going-to-change-every-job.html\">drastically</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/accenture-plans-on-exiting-staff-who-cant-be-reskilled-on-ai.html\">reshape</a> their workforces.</p><p>\"It's a great country. We're creative,\" Lynch said. \"America creates, China duplicates, and Europe legislates.\"</p><p>(Follow <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/the-best-stocks-in-the-market/\"><em>Josh Brown's take on the best stocks in the market right now</em></a>, including his investment outlook and where he sees opportunities next.)</p><p>(<em>Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live.

If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999.\"</p><p>The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said today's market is reminiscent of the setup leading up to the burst of the dot-com bubble in late 1999, with dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones said the circular deals or vendor financing happening in the artificial intelligence space today also made him \"nervous.\"</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs.

The Federal Reserve had just begun a new easing cycle, whereas rate hikes were on the way before the market top in 2000. The U.S. is now running a 6% budget deficit, while in 1999, there was a budget surplus of $99,000, Jones said.</p><p>\"That fiscal monetary combination is a brew that we haven't seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early '50s,\" he said.</p><p>The longtime investor highlighted the tension at the heart of every late-stage bull market — the eagerness to capture outsized gains and the inevitability of a painful correction.</p><p>\"You have to get on and off the train pretty quick. If you just think about bull markets, the greatest price appreciations always [occurs] the 12 months preceding the top,\" Jones said. \"It kind of doubles whatever the annual averages, and before then, if you don't play it, you're missing out on the juice; if you do play it, you have to have really happy feet, because there will be a really, really bad end to it.\"</p><p>To be sure, Jones isn't predicting an immediate downturn. He believes the bull market still has room to run before it reaches its final phase.</p><p>\"It will take a speculative frenzy for us to elevate those prices. It will take more retail buying. It'll take more recruitment from a variety of others from long short hedge funds, from real money, etc.,\" he said.</p><p>He said he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year to take advantage of the rally fueled by the fear of missing out.</p><p>Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the co-founder of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.</p><p><em>Correction: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. A previous version misstated the percentage.</em></p></div></div>",

The report said that the SEC is responding to a whistleblower complained filed this year along with multiple short-seller reports, and added that neither the company nor its officials have been accused of wrongdoing.</p><p>An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn't typically comment on the \"existence or non-existence\" of regulatory matters.</p><p>\"That said, as a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels.\"</p><p>The stock dropped 14% in regular trading after the report, which landed shortly before market close.

He showed how third-party applications could plug in with OpenAI's Apps SDK, or software development framework.</p><p>\"When someone's using ChatGPT, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name,\" Altman said. \"For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChatGPT and then say, Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram.

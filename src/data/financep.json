    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "body": "In Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Walt Disney Co. tallied its second billion-dollar film of 2025 with the help of a determined bunny and mischievous fox.\"Zootopia 2\" is set to top $1 billion at the global box office on Friday, according to company estimates, joining the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\" as the only Hollywood-made films to cross the benchmark this year. Heading into the weekend, the film had tallied $232.7 million domestically and $753.4 million from international markets.\"This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world — and that is a Zootopia dream come true,\" Jared Bush, chief creative officer at Walt Disney Animation Studios, wrote in a statement Friday.The only other film to cross the billion-dollar threshold this year is China's \"Ne Zha 2,\" which has collected $2.2 billion since its release in January, according to data from Comscore.\"With the evolution of global market trends in recent years, reaching $1 billion has become a little more of a novelty again,\" Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory, told CNBC. He also noted the importance of the film's \"staggering success in China.\" Nearly $450 million of the global haul for \"Zootopia 2\" has come from the region so far — a massive figure considering China has decreased the number of American films it permits to play in its theaters and has threatened to restrict even more because of escalated tariffs.\"Zootopia 2\" had the highest animated opening of all time for a non-local title in China and broke the record for highest-grossing non-local animated film of all time within five days of its release in the country, Disney reported.The film's billion-dollar haul also highlights a transition in the domestic theatrical marketplace. PG-rated family films have outperformed PG-13 and R-rated films at the box office in 2025. So far, PG films released this year have generated $2.7 billion in the U.S. and Canada, while PG-13 films have tallied $2.5 billion and R-rated films have collected $2.4 billion.This shift started in 2024, when PG-rated films sold more tickets domestically than any other rated film for the first time ever. PG-13 films had dominated the space for decades, according to data from Comscore. \"With PG-rated films, it is often the kids who make the decision as to whether to hit the multiplex, and their influence can be seen directly in the numbers for the category that have hit all-time highs over the past couple of years,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"Equally impressive is that most PG movie tickets sold are at a child-friendly lower price point and therefore reaching these huge box-office milestones is made even more impressive.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of Fandango and CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon shares jumped more than 9% on Friday, after the company announced its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down. McDonald's departure, effective Jan. 31, follows more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. Lululemon's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen.

AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people.

The photo has Clinton's signature on it.Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing.

Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.

    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

This administration is working diligently to ensure that aliens in our country illegally can no longer fly unless it is out of our country to self-deport.\"The Times said that it is not known how many people have been arrested as a result of TSA's information sharing.But the newspaper said it had obtained documents that indicate the program led to the Nov. 20 arrest at Boston's Logan Airport of a college student, Any Lucía López Belloza, who was deported to Honduras two days later. López had been on her way to visit her family in Texas for the Thanksgiving holiday.The Times previously reported that López was brought to the United States from Honduras at age 7, and that her family said neither they nor she knew she was subject to a deportation order.",

He said he still believes in the power of artificial intelligence and suggested some of these names might be worth buying once their valuations come down.\"We need every piece of data to keep up on what's really happening as the money rotates from the Magnificent Seven to all these other different other areas, kind of like a fire hose,\" he said.Tuesday brings the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report. Cramer noted that Wall Street has largely been in the dark about macroeconomic data for the past few months thanks to the lengthy government shutdown. A strong jobs report could call into question the need for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, Cramer said, while weaker figures mean the central bank can keep easing. Retail sales data is also set to be released on Tuesday, and Cramer added that this report needs to be weak to justify more cuts.Jabil and General Mills are set to report Wednesday. Cramer noted that Jabil is a major manufacturer of infrastructure and hardware for data centers. He said the company's earnings could reverse the declines in AI stocks. Cramer indicated he'll be waiting to hear from industry giant General Mills, noting that a number of food stocks have struggled recently due to the popularity of GLP-1 weight loss drugs and a growing emphasis on healthier eating habits.On Thursday, Darden, Cintas, Nike and FedEx will report. While the rising price of beef has hurt some restaurants, Cramer suggested restaurant giant Darden has been protected by its Olive Garden chain, which he said has \"minimal beef exposure.\" He said uniform and safety equipment supplier Cintas will be a solid measure of how small businesses are faring. It may be too soon to expect a turnaround at Nike, Cramer continued, but FedEx could be the \"star of the week.\" He praised the shipping company's management, adding that the e-commerce boom seems set to to continue. Friday brings earnings from Carnival, Conagra and Paychex, and Cramer suggested all three reports will provide valuable insight. Carnival can speak to the state of discretionary spending, Conagra can show whether consumers are cooking more meals at home, and payroll processer Paychex can give a read on small and medium-sized businesses.watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nike.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "watch nowHoliday shopping has always felt like a \"chore\" for Amrita Bhasin. Between deciding what to buy, comparing prices and checking reviews, the 24-year-old retail tech CEO said she spent more than 15 hours each year buying gifts for her friends and family, a process that took the joy out of giving. But this year, Bhasin said she did all of her shopping in a fraction of the time and even had a little \"fun\" — all thanks to her new personal assistant: ChatGPT. \"I feel like I've got that physical store associate that I'm talking to, so I feel like I'm getting better recommendations. I actually think my tendency to buy is higher because of ChatGPT,\" Bhasin, based in Menlo Park, California, told CNBC. \"It has really changed the game.\" Bhasin is one of the many shoppers turning to AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Perplexity this holiday season to help them buy gifts for their loved ones, and maybe a few for themselves, too. Whether consumers use them to get gift ideas or compare prices, AI platforms are poised to reshape the shopping experience and drive billions in revenue this holiday season as it becomes harder to get discovered on traditional search platforms.In a report published last month, Salesforce said it expects AI to drive a staggering $263 billion in global online holiday sales this year, representing 21% of all holiday orders. Though estimates vary widely, surveys conducted by Visa, Zeta Global and other organizations found that between 40% and 83% of consumers plan to use AI for shopping this holiday season. Meanwhile, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites surged 760% between Nov. 1 and Dec. 1, according to Adobe. While AI shopping is in its early stages, initial reads on how shoppers are interacting with it show the opportunity it can bring for retailers. Shoppers arriving on retail websites from generative AI platforms are 30% more likely to buy something and about 14% more engaged than those coming from non-AI sources, meaning they're spending more time on the site and are less likely to leave immediately, Adobe found. These AI-fueled shopping visits now generate 8% more revenue per session, the firm found. AI tools can also help shoppers spot deals and aid lesser-known brands in getting discovered — about half of the gifts Bhasin bought this year came from brands she'd never shopped before.\"It's where consumers are going, because they're just asking questions around, like, 'Hey, where can I find the best gift under $20 for my niece that cares about these things?'\" said Kimberly Shenk, the founder and CEO of Novi, a tech firm that helps brands adjust to AI shopping. Emily Park | CNBCThe surge in AI shopping has led retailers big and small to rethink their strategies to ensure they're showing up where customers expect them to be. Walmart and Amazon have each launched their own AI shopping assistants, and others, including Walmart, Target and Etsy, have partnered with OpenAI so customers can search for items or buy products without leaving ChatGPT. Apparel retailer PacSun said it hopes to join OpenAI's platform and in the meantime is reformatting its website so its teen-friendly clothes will show up in AI searches. Others are changing their budgets, directing funds away from SEO, or search engine optimization, and into AEO, or answer engine optimization, and hiring outside firms to help them navigate the shift. Shenk said her company has seen a \"major surge in demand\" from retailers and brands that have started to see a steep decline in traffic from social media ads and search engines.\"I've heard so many brands talking about their paid advertising in Meta and all these different places really just not performing and ultimately seeing a ton of that transition over to AI mode in Google, ChatGPT, Perplexity,\" Shenk said. \"I think people were caught off guard … so brands are really scrambling to figure out, 'How do I know if I'm visible? I have no idea if I'm even showing up. I have no idea how I'm showing up, but I'm seeing all my traffic drop off, and I got to figure that out. Now.'\" Brands are walking a tightrope. They have to adjust to consumers who are using AI to discover products, but still be present through traditional channels for those who prefer old-fashioned shopping. While AI companies and retailers themselves have made massive investments in the chatbot shopping experience, some consumers also say it doesn't yet measure up to searching for gifts themselves.Walmart, Target and others join the AI race As more shoppers start their gift searches on AI chatbots, some of the country's biggest retailers, including Walmart, Target and Etsy, have announced their own strategies to try to attract customers through AI assistants.Walmart announced a deal in October with OpenAI that will enable shoppers to both find and buy items without leaving ChatGPT. Yet the big-box retailer hasn't shared a launch date.Etsy and many Shopify merchants, including Glossier, have also signed deals with OpenAI for its Instant Checkout feature, which will initially allow customers in the U.S. to make single-item purchases. Instant Checkout launched with Etsy in late September, and ChatGPT has begun to roll out a few Shopify merchants, including Skims, Vuori and Spanx, an OpenAI spokesperson said.Target announced a deal last month to allow customers to shop Target's app within ChatGPT. The beta feature enables shoppers to purchase multiple items in a single transaction, including groceries, and choose if they want delivery or curbside pickup.On the other hand, Amazon — an online retail behemoth where many shoppers begin their product search — has taken the opposite approach. It has moved to block external AI chatbots, including those developed by OpenAI, Google and Meta, from crawling its website to try to stop them from pulling in product listings as part of their answers.Amazon has gone a step further by sending a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity AI to try to prevent users of its AI browser, Comet, from purchasing its items. The startup described Amazon's legal threat as \"bullying.\"Read moreAlong with their different strategies with outside tech companies, Amazon, Walmart and Target are among the retailers who have built their own AI-powered chatbots in the hopes of reeling in curious shoppers during the holiday season and beyond. On Walmart's app, customers are greeted by a yellow smiley-faced agent called Sparky that can answer questions and recommend products. Amazon has a shopping assistant called Rufus. And Target has an AI-powered tool, Target Gift Finder, for the second holiday season in a row.On Walmart's earnings call in November, CEO Doug McMillon said agentic AI will be one of the growth drivers for the retailer's e-commerce business. He said the technology will \"help people save time and have more fun shopping.\"Walmart has added other capabilities for Sparky, such as recommended shopping lists for parties. Incoming CEO John Furner also said the assistant will eventually be able to remind customers about items they may want to reorder.Tracy Poulliot, senior vice president of shopping experiences for Walmart U.S., told CNBC that \"customers are really starting to rely on these GenAI assistants to take on more of a problem-solving approach than your traditional item-by-item search experience.\"So far, Target said, thousands of customer have used its Gift Finder, with common searches about sports, beauty and wellness, cooking and apparel gifts. In a statement, the company said it had early insights that the tool was driving higher engagement and larger shopping carts than the year prior.Prat Vemana, Target's chief information and product officer, said the retailer is already seeing changes in how customers are looking for items on its website and app. About 25% of its customer searches are descriptive and conversational in phrasing, rather than keyword-based, he said.How retailers are overhauling digital marketingShopping research feature in ChatGPT.Courtesy: ChatGPTSince the dawn of online search, SEO has guided online marketing strategies and evolved into a game of stuffing relevant keywords into the back end of product listings to ensure they pop up on Google.For example, if a shopper was looking for a new green sweater, Googling \"green sweater\" would bring up a slew of product matches from retailers, with some links appearing higher than others if they were sponsored. \"You pay somebody and you spend money, you get yourself listed on top,\" said Shirley Gao, the chief digital and information officer at PacSun. \"Now [with AI], there's no way you can pay anybody. This is very authentic.\" When searching for products on an AI platform, a consumer might write a few sentences, explaining the event they need the product for and sharing their preferences, location, body type and size. The AI platform then hunts for credible information to ensure it's a product worth buying. It looks for keywords, but also other data like reviews, credible media reports and information about the item's materials. OpenAI's ChatGPT ranks results based on what best matches the shopper's request, not based on ads, paid placement or whether a company has a business deal with OpenAI, a spokesperson said. Retailers who are partners with ChatGPT provide OpenAI with direct product feeds, which help make sure listings are more up-to-date. In some cases, they are integrated to allow for Instant Checkout in the chat.ChatGPT decides how to rank merchants who sell the same product by considering factors including availability, price, quality, whether a merchant is the primary seller and whether Instant Checkout is enabled, the company spokesperson said.Brands CNBC spoke with said this evolution is forcing them to rethink their entire media, content and e-commerce strategies. SEO still matters — but the information they're putting on the back end of their websites is evolving.Gao said her team has been reformatting PacSun's website so it's easier for AI platforms to read it, including through new gift and style guide pages. She said those product listings share more details like item specifications and customer feedback.In an interview with CNBC, Target's Vemana said the retailer historically tracked how it showed up in customers' online searches. Now, he said, it wants to make sure it shows up better in AI chatbots' search results.To increase visibility, he said, Target is providing richer descriptions of its merchandise, such as listing unique features like sustainable fabrics or explaining how a product fits into a trend or theme.A shopper at a Target store ahead of Black Friday in Jersey City, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMichael Wieder, a Brooklyn-based dad who co-founded baby and toddler goods retailer Lalo, said he and his team have spent time considering the questions people could be putting into AI platforms and ensuring product listings answer them.For example, instead of keyword stuffing product listings with basic attributes like the material, size and color of the item, his team has been putting in more detailed information like \"good for small spaces,\" \"great for apartment living\" or \"best gifts for kids under one year old.\" \"I'm looking for the best gift for a child that is, you know, this age that lives in this place,\" Wieder said in an interview. \"We're taking it a step further in how we construct the infrastructure of our website and the content that lives within our website.\" Ethique Beauty, which sells shampoo and conditioner bars in retailers like Ulta Beauty, Wegmans and Whole Foods, has \"completely changed\" its approach to search, leading to a 90% increase in traffic from AI platforms in the past six months, CEO Erica Cocilova said in an interview.\"When you're thinking about what you need as a consumer, your shopping doesn't necessarily start with products,\" Cocilova said. \"People are searching for things like, 'I need scalp health,' right? Or 'my scalp is flaky. I'm struggling with oily scalp. My hair is too dry.' They're looking for solutions.\" Cocilova and her team combed through the business's customer service FAQs, talked to shoppers, examined reviews and scoured the internet to get a better idea of what shampoo customers sought. Then, they added more information to product listings, including brand certifications and details about the company's supply chain.They also took the biggest questions consumers had — like \"how to sleep with curly hair\" — and created blog posts answering them. \"Any hair brand could be talking about that, but we talk about it in a way that's got super dense, rich content and then ties it back to how our products are different and address the needs for curls,\" Cocilova said. The changes have led more shoppers to Ethique's products through its own website and its partners, and the company has enjoyed a boost in sales. Even so, the shift to optimizing for AI search has required a steep investment in both internal staff and consulting relative to SEO, a cost other businesses have also had to take on as they try to stay relevant.\"What I would say is the return is better, because the person that ends up on your site, or any site, to shop is just that much more educated,\" she said. \"They're not getting to your site and having to do as much research, right? They're there to shop.\" When AI falls short Though AI platforms are pointing many shoppers in the right direction, not every tool hits the mark. When CNBC asked Target's Gift Finder for ideas based on personalized scenarios, the chatbot answered with links to gift guides and repeated itself instead of delivering specific product recommendations.Through a company spokesperson, Target said the chatbot's results include \"a variety of gift recommendation items grouped by category.\" He said the company's tool is learning from the customer interactions and that Target is regularly updating its algorithms While AI platforms can be effective when people need to do product research or are looking for something highly specific, some consumers prefer the traditional shopping experience.Diana Tan, a 39-year-old startup founder based in Seattle, asked ChatGPT to help her build a capsule wardrobe earlier this year and provided a slew of information about her body type, preferences and budget. Instead of a curated set of options, she said she was repeatedly served boring basics like black shirts, gray pants and black turtlenecks.\"It just became almost like talking to a demented grandmother, where you're just constantly trying to remind it, 'Okay, I really want something that is in this price range. No, this is too expensive. Please stop sending me this,'\" Tan said. \"And then they'll come at me like, 'Here's a black turtleneck again.' Okay. No. Please stop sending me black turtlenecks. I really didn't want this the first time.\"Ultimately, Tan gave up.\"I think it takes the joy out of shopping,\" she said. \"So much of shopping is still very much just browsing. … After a while, I'm like, well, you know, it's actually more fun and more interesting for me to just go to Nordstrom Rack, or, like, anywhere else, and just look for what I actually want.\"",

Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, Oracle told investors that it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia. That's not the only way the software giant plans to supply robust computing power to meet soaring demand. It's also ratcheting up leases.As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years, the company disclosed in a quarterly filing on Thursday. That's up 148% from the end of August.Oracle had $10 billion in cloud capacity arrangements at the end of the quarter, according to the filing. Over the past decade, Oracle has diversified into cloud infrastructure, where it now goes up against Amazon, Microsoft and Google to rent out access to servers, storage and Nvidia graphics chips for running artificial intelligence models. OpenAI has become a major Oracle cloud customer, having announced a commitment worth over $300 billion in September. Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor that for years served as the startup's sole cloud provider, has also ramped up leases to augment its in-house data center footprint. Microsoft has struck deals with so-called neoclouds CoreWeave and Lambda. Oracle worked with startup Crusoe to enable the first phase of OpenAI's Stargate data center site in Abilene, Texas.Investors are questioning how Oracle will pay for its AI data center build-outs, RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, told CNBC earlier this week.In September Oracle raised $18 billion in new debt. By the end of November, the company owed over $124 billion when including operating lease liabilities, according to the filing, up from about $89 billion a year earlier. \"In terms of funding our growth, there are a variety of sources available to us throughout our debt structure in public bond, bank and private debt markets,\" Doug Kehring, Oracle's principal financial officer, told analysts on Wednesday's conference call.Some customers can also bring their own chips, which could lower Oracle's costs, said Clay Magouyrk, one of the company's two recently appointed CEOs.In its earnings release on Wednesday, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected revenue despite booming demand for its AI infrastructure.

As food inflation and affordability dominates the conversation about the U.S. consumer, new restaurant purchasing data shows even among Americans who are going to restaurants, many are in the mindset of cutting back.\"Appetizer orders are up 20% year over year, even as entrees and desserts are largely flat or declining,\" said Jim Pazzanese, executive vice president of global strategic procurement of Buyers Edge Platform, which tracks supply chain data within the food service industry. \"The shift is visible at the item level,\" he said, with some popular appetizer sales to restaurant operators experiencing growth rates north of 30%.Top-growing appetizersMozzarella sticks, up 36%Pickle chips, up 35%Cheese curds, up 33%Jalapeno poppers, up 20%Cheese bites, up 17%Source: Buyers Edge, year-to-date dataPazzanese is calling the current restaurant environment the \"appetizer economy.\"Meanwhile, he says dessert orders are down 2 percent year over year.One reason for the rising popularity of appetizers, Pazzanese says, is their link to promotions, which are key to getting Americans to spend in the current economic environment.\"Consumers realize appetizers are more frequently tied to promotions and drink specials,\" he said. \"This makes eating out more affordable.\"He added that buying of frozen or shelf-stable appetizers, which are the fastest-growing appetizer SKUs, makes sense from an economic perspective for restaurant operators, too. \"This is helping owners and managers reduce waste and manage unpredictable demands,\" Pazzanese said.\"The K-shaped economy we are seeing is being reflected in food spending,\" said Brian Choi, CEO of the Food Institute. In the grocery store, he said that is being seen in the continued migration to private label brands as food inflation influences consumer purchasing.\"The top 10 percent are increasing their spending in novel products and are willing to pay, but the vast majority of consumers are moving down to private label versus national brands,\" said Choi. \"Consumers can save anywhere from 10-20 percent by switching to a private label,\" Choi added.In a recent Food Institute survey, consumer perception of private labels has gone up substantially over the last five years, and it is now on par with national brands.\"Albertsons, Costco, and Kroger are just some examples of companies increasing their shelf space for their own,\" Choi said.\"Save Mart launched a private-label for beef, poultry, and pork, and Amazon launched Amazon Grocery with many products under $5,\" Choi said. \"Albertsons believes private label could represent 30 percent of sales.\"Amazon debuted its private-label grocer in October.While inflation may be down from 2022 highs, food inflation has been stubborn, according to Food Institute data. \"Food price inflation has increased since the midpoint of 2025, with food-at-home prices up in the range of 1.9 percent to 2.7 percent year-over-year,\" Choi said.The latest consumer price index for September — the October report was not produced due to the government shutdown and the November report delayed — showed food prices up 3.1% year over year. Prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year.\"We expect further growth for private label, and it should outpace national brands in 2026,\" Choi said.The September CPI showed \"food away from home\" inflation even higher than food inflation overall, at 3.7%, with full-service meals at 4.2%. That is leading to more private-label spending by restaurants, college and university dining halls, and convenience stores.\"The $1.5 trillion food away from home industry is seeing the move to more private label brands to save money,\" said Phil Kafarakis, CEO of the IFMA, the Food Away from Home Association.\"Tariffs and supply chain issues have led to price increases, especially in perishable items,\" Kafarakis said.Pricing relief is not expected to arrive soon.\"Consumers do not understand the food supply chain,\" Kafarakis said. \"It doesn't correct itself in weeks.\"IMFA expects that consumers will start to see some price relief from tariffs in the spring.\"Consumers do not know how long it takes to produce beef, and if you have a drought or other problems that impact the supply chain, it takes time to build the supply chain back up,\" Kafarakis said.",

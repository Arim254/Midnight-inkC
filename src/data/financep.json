    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingIf it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them prove to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

    "body": "Waymo autonomous taxis turns onto Post Street in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo temporarily paused its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday, ahead of expected storms in the area, according to a customer notification in the company's driverless ride-hailing app.\"Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,\" the notification read.Earlier this week the Alphabet-owned company said it will update its fleet so its robotaxi service is better able to perform during power outages.On Dec. 20, Waymo paused service during a blackout in San Francisco that left tens of thousands of people in the area without power and caused some of its autonomous vehicles to halt in mid-traffic, contributing to or causing gridlock.The National Weather Service extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday 10 p.m. local time.Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, or say whether regulators required its service pause on Thursday given the flash flood warnings.The California Public Utilities Commission — which regulates driverless ride-hailing services in the state — did not immediately respond to requests for information during the Christmas holiday on Thursday.Waymo currently operates a commercial, driverless service in five U.S. markets, up from three at the end of 2024. Waymo's robotaxi service has been operating in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles this year. The company intends to significantly expand its service area across and beyond the U.S. in 2026, CNBC previously reported.Waymo is facing increased public scrutiny and safety concerns as it attempts to expand its robotaxi service.The former CEO of San Francisco's Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin, told CNBC that regulators and robotaxi companies can take valuable lessons away from the chaos that arose with Waymo vehicles during the PG&E power outages last week.\"I think we need to be asking 'what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?'\" Tumlin said. He also suggested regulators may want to set up a staged system that will allow autonomous vehicle companies to rapidly scale their operations, provided they meet specific tests.One of those tests, he said, would be how quickly a company can get their autonomous vehicles safely out of the way of traffic if they encounter something that is confusing like a four-way intersection with no functioning traffic lights.Cities and regulators should also seek more data from robotaxi companies about the planned or actual performance of their vehicles during expected emergencies such as blackouts, floods or earthquakes, Tumlin said.",

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "Different types of leather are seen at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory, on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesBootmaker Twisted X — known for its Western footwear — was thrown into chaos overnight when President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports in April. The company turned a conference room at its Decatur, Texas, headquarters into a \"tariff war room\" as import costs on its finished work boots surged, shipments were paused mid-transit and invoices fluctuated so wildly that staff found themselves recalculating margins by the hour. \"A lot of other leather companies had to pause shipments because of the chaos and it felt like prices were going all over the place before you could take account,\" Twisted X CEO Prasad Reddy told CNBC. \"It was a very uncertain time.\"Twisted X wasn't alone. Leather retailers big and small are facing similar challenges, and the result has been higher prices at the register that are unlikely to come down anytime soon.  Pre-tariff inventory is gone, while replacement orders cost far more. The products hitting shelves now were manufactured with more expensive hides, subjected to pricier foreign processing and shipped with higher freight costs than last year's merchandise, industry experts said. The Yale Budget Lab projects that leather goods prices will remain elevated by nearly 22% for at least the next one to two years, driven by inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and heavy tariff exposure, particularly across China, Vietnam, Italy and India. \"The reason why leather is hit so hard is twofold,\" said John Ricco with the budget lab. \"No. 1, some of these tariff rates that are the highest are placed on different countries where we import most leather. The second reason is that we just import a lot of leather, and, more broadly, apparel-related products from these trading partners than we make.\"The costs have already shown up for brands like Tapestry, owner of handbag makers Coach and Kate Spade. Executives told investors in August that tariff-related expenses could total $160 million, warning of \"greater than previously expected profit headwinds\" moving forward.Chasing low costsA pair of Twisted X boots starts the way most U.S. leather goods do: as a raw, salted cow hide from an American ranch. That hide is shipped overseas, usually to Asia, to be tanned into leather. For Twisted X, roughly half of its products are tanned in China, down from 90% in 2017, Reddy said. Once turned into leather, the material typically is shipped to another factory — often in China, Vietnam, Mexico or India — to be cut, stitched and assembled, before finally returning to the U.S. as a finished product. Under normal conditions, that global supply chain kept costs low. But reliance on foreign production backfired when the new duties took effect, Reddy said. \"When tariffs happened, everything stopped,\" said Kerry Brozyna, president of the Leather and Hide Council of America. \"So they [China] couldn't take shipments in because if they took them in and they computed in the price of the tariff, they wouldn't be able to sell them.\" Currently, the U.S. leather trade deficit is one of the widest in manufacturing. In 2023, the U.S. imported $1.37 billion in leather apparel while exporting just $92.7 million, a roughly 15-to-1 deficit, according to the Census Bureau. China alone supplies about one-third of all leather goods imported into the U.S.\"Being so reliant on many overseas productions methods ended up hurting many people in the industry in the beginning when they didn't know exactly what was going to happen,\" Reddy said. \"At Twisted X, we have been working for a while to reduce reliance on China.\" As the duties took effect, Twisted X and many other leather companies rushed to exit China and encountered new problems: bottlenecks in Cambodia and Bangladesh, longer lead times in Vietnam, and a sudden 50% tariff on many Indian leather exports imposed in August. By late summer, nearly every leather company was paying more at every stage — for hides, tanning, assembly and re-importation, according to Reddy. \"We saw all our channels to make boots keep getting more expensive until we were able to figure out a good solution,\" Reddy said. Conglomerates like Steve Madden are also feeling the impacts. \"The third quarter was challenging, driven largely by the impact of new tariffs on goods imported into the United States,\" Edward Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Steve Madden, said on an earnings call in November.Price increasesMany companies absorbed what they could, but that buffer is fading, Ricco said. Despite rerouting supply chains and moving production, Twisted X said it still had to raise prices around 1% to 3% this year. \"We look at it as a success,\" Twisted X's chief marketing officer, Tricia Mahoney, told CNBC. \"Many competitors were looking at bigger increases and but we made sure to prioritize our customers and keep the prices as stable as possible. Next year could be tough but we are more prepared than ever.\"Already, leather luxury prices are up. Chanel's iconic Classic Flap bag is about 5% more expensive than it was last year, after yet another round of price hikes this spring, according to luxury retail pricing data.But, by 2026, the leather industry's price shock will likely be more prominent, Ricco said. Analysts expect prices for leather footwear and accessories to rise roughly 22% over the next year or two and around 7% long term as higher tariffs, freight costs and scarce premium hides move through the system. \"2026 is going to probably be where rubber meets the road,\" Ricco said. \"They [leather companies] have to make these decisions about whether to pass cost increases on to consumers, whether to cut jobs and whether to reduce payments to shareholders.\"Domestic declinesWorkers at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory put the finishing touches on boots on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesThe decline of a once-booming domestic leather manufacturing industry is also reducing the options companies have to pivot away from the global supply chain. In the 1950s, manufacturers employed more than 300,000 people in roughly 1,000 tanneries nationwide, mainly spread across the Midwest and Northeast, according to the Leather and Hide Council of America. The workforce has fallen to around 50,000 in 2025, with the number of tanneries dwindling to a few hundred, per the council. Reddy said the so-called golden age of domestic manufacturing is long gone. The burden of tariffs has had the steepest impact on brands that rely on finished goods from Asia — not companies sourcing leather domestically. So far, rather than restoring U.S. manufacturing, as the Trump administration had predicated the tariffs on, many brands have responded by reshuffling suppliers overseas to contain costs, according to industry experts.Women work in a leather factory in Kolkata, India, on November 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCattle shortagesU.S. leather companies are also dealing with a raw material shortage, as there are simply fewer cattle hides to work with.The U.S. cattle herd is at its smallest point since the 1950s following prolonged drought, rising feed costs and herd liquidation. Since hides are a mandatory byproduct of dairy and beef production, fewer cattle mean fewer hides — even as global demand for top-grade leather persists for handbags, upholstery and footwear.\"Few cattle means that what hides are left makes it more expensive to produce boots with high-quality leather that we use,\" Reddy said. For shoppers hoping for a discount by trading down for a synthetic, alternatives haven't been spared either. Many faux-leather and polyurethane materials rely on petrochemical inputs sourced from Asia, which also fall under the new tariff schedules. Retailers and industry analysts said synthetic footwear and handbags are seeing mid- to high-single-digit cost increases, according to industry estimates.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "People gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a rare blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting his bid to overrule a lower court order and allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of local and state leaders.The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in October after a District Court judge blocked the president's plans to send troops to aid in an immigration crackdown. The court on Tuesday declined Trump's request.\"Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a post on X.\"This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump's march toward authoritarianism,\" Pritzker continued.U.S. presidents can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, but guardsmen are typically not permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. Trump's attempts to send troops to mostly blue cities to fight crime have tested the bounds of presidential authority and led to a series of lawsuits. Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by the Constitution or Congress, the court found Trump lacked the authority to deploy troops to Illinois in this case.\"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,\" the unsigned order states.The order is not final, but for now bars the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch offered dissenting opinions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion.Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Portland in recent months, despite objections from local leaders. Those deployments have resulted in several lawsuits, including a legal challenge from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and Trump foil, and local officials in D.C.\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday.\"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" Jackson continued. \"Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

    "body": "With any credit card, there's typically a limit to how much you can spend. And experts say choosing the right limit can play an important role in maintaining good credit health.Set based on factors like your income, credit history and ability to repay, your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow on a credit card or account. \"Generally speaking, more credit is better, as long as you don't use it as a crutch to overspend and take on too much debt,\" says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. Experts often recommend seeking out a limit that's well above how much you'll spend in a month to maximize your credit score. Your \"ideal\" credit limit will depend on your personal spending habits and preferences, Rossman says.The best limit for your credit scoreToo keep your credit score high, it's best to use only 10% to 30% of your available credit and pay your statements off in full every month, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.The percentage of your available credit that you're using is a metric known as credit utilization. Keeping utilization low shows lenders you manage credit responsibly, which helps improve your credit score, while hitting that limit every month signals to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit and a higher lending risk, thus lowering your score, says Rossman.Working backward from the an ideal credit utilization of 10% to 30%, if you typically spend around $5,000 a month on your card, you should have a limit of $50,000, Tsantes says. By the same metric, if you typically spend around $2,500 on your card, $25,000 could be a good limit, he adds. \"The idea is that you'll never be close to hitting that limit,\" Tsantes says. Having a seemingly high limit is there not as money available to use, but as a buffer to keep your balance well below your maximum and your credit utilization low.It may also be smart to consult a trusted financial professional who can help you determine the amount of credit that makes sense for you.It's OK to stick to a more practical limitCredit card debt can be costly and hard to pay off. So, if you know you're likely to view your credit limit as the amount you can spend each month, it may be wiser to stick to a limit that covers just the essentials with a small buffer, Rossman says.\"You definitely don't want to be hitting or approaching that limit or spending more than you can afford to pay back,\" he says. \"Even though it's good for your credit score to have more credit, if you're going to use that as a way to overspend, that could be a danger.\"However, even with a lower limit, it's still possible to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, Rossman says. If your line of credit is just enough to cover your essentials and you're getting close to your limit every month, there are \"workarounds\" to lower your utilization, like making extra payments throughout the month to keep your usage under 30%.How to increase your credit limitTo increase your credit limit, you can either request a credit limit increase for an existing card or open a new card with a new line of credit, Rossman says. Start by checking with your existing credit card issuer to see if requesting a credit limit increase will trigger a hard or soft credit inquiry, he says. Hard inquiries can cause a small, temporary dip in your credit score, while a soft inquiry is a routine or informational check that does not affect your credit score. If your issuer will use a soft inquiry, increasing the limit on an existing card can boost available credit and lower your credit utilization without hurting your score, Rossman says.If your issuer is going to run a hard inquiry, it may be more strategic to open a new credit card with a different set of rewards and benefits, Rossman says. That way, you can have more options to maximize benefits across your cards, he says.Although increasing your credit limit can raise your spending power, avoid treating that extra credit as more money or an emergency fund for \"desperate times,\" Rossman says. Spending more than you can afford on a credit card can lead to high-interest debt that becomes difficult to repay, he says, especially if your financial situation is already strained.\"Having a credit card with a $5,000 limit — yes, that could help you in a pinch — but that's not the same as having $5,000 in the bank,\" Rossman says. \"This is debt. It can be very expensive debt.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

Its monster gains over recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom has made the stock an indisputable star of the retail investing world, in spite of Wall Street's reservations about valuation.Individual investors were on track to buy nearly $8 billion in Palantir stock on balance in 2025, per Vanda data as of Dec. 8. That is a gain of more than 80% over the prior year, and it reflects an increase of over 400% from 2023.Palantir is on pace to be the fifth-most bought security on balance for the year, Vanda data shows. The stock sits behind only megacap names like Tesla and Nvidia and popular exchange-traded funds such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the entire U.S. market benchmark.\"It's been great,\" said Viraj Patel, deputy head of research at Vanda, which tracks retail trader flows. ​​\"Palantir has kind of been brought into this group of AI-tech poster [children].\"An 'insane' businessPalantir has won the hearts of retail investors amid its takeoff as a stock. Its shares have surged more than 150% so far in 2025, placing the name on track for its third straight year with triple-digit gains.The stock has skyrocketed nearly 3,000% in the last three years, crushing the S&P 500's roughly 80% gain and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite's more than 120% climb in the same time frame.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPalantir vs. the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, 1-year chartSince its 2020 market debut, Palantir has been considered a mysterious enterprise given its business with both public and private entities.On the surface level, Palantir helps both governments and major corporations organize their data. Beyond being viewed as a beneficiary of the push to adopt AI, it's seen as a winner under the Trump administration's priorities of increasing federal government efficiency and bolstering national defense.\"The joke for a while has always been like, 'What does Palantir even do?'\" said Paxton Earl, an investment banker with a focus on software who began reading regulatory reports to better understand the company. After learning more, he remembers thinking: \"This is actually an insane business. It's really good.\"Earl discovered through research that the company's revenue was more diversified beyond military work than he initially predicted. In addition, the 23-year-old found Palantir worked with consumer-facing brands he knew like Ferrari and Wendy's.The logo of U.S. software company Palantir Technologies is seen in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, 2020.Arnd Wiegmann | ReutersThe San Diego resident said he picked up more shares following the company's third-quarter earnings report in early November. Palantir tanked 16% that month as investors dumped their AI plays on valuation fears, and the stock posted its worst monthly performance in more than two years.Wall Street largely chalked up the sell-off to profit-taking and broader concerns about the health of the AI trade. Vanda found the bulk of Palantir's retail buying took place in the first nine months of the year, then cooled off as growing fears of an AI bubble left investors questioning the trade.A retail 'romance'Palantir has gone out of its way to court individual traders like Earl.While other well-known companies typically reserve the question-and-answer portions of earnings calls for Wall Street analysts or journalists, Palantir also takes inquiries from retail investors. In an annual video shared from a ski trail late last year, CEO Alex Karp specifically shouted out these small shareholders.\"Exceedingly grateful to all of you individual investors who took the time and opportunity, and had the courage to look past conventional, rusty, crusty platitudes,\" Karp said, while was wearing reflective goggles and gripping ski poles.The stock has become a hot topic on the popular WallStreetBets Reddit forum. On several days in 2025, it was the most mentioned stock on the discussion board, according to meme stock tracking firm Breakout Point.Palantir \"has been a long-standing WallStreetBets romance,\" said Ivan Ćosović, managing director at Breakout Point. \"They adore it.\"To be sure, not all of the social media chatter has been positive. Some investing content creators have questioned if they can ethically hold Palantir's stock given the business' connection to wartime technology and its partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Big money's hesitancyWall Street hasn't jumped on board with the same fervor as the average Joe. The average analyst polled by LSEG has a hold rating, with several citing apprehension about the stock's multiple.The company's valuation has made its stock a \"non-starter\" for institutional clients, according to Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Palantir has a multiple of around 450 times trailing earnings, running circles around the S&P 500's average of close to 28.On the other hand, Luria said retail investors are likely impressed by Palantir's \"ambitious\" mission to play a role in defending the U.S. These everyday investors are likely also enticed by Karp, who Luria said is similar to Tesla CEO Elon Musk in his ability to sell a business vision. However, Luria said Karp hasn't attracted the same amount of controversy.Alex Karp, chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc., speaks during the AIPCon conference in Palo Alto, California, US, on March 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLuria said Palantir also draws parallels to Tesla's stock 10 years ago, when the carmaker was presenting an electric vehicle-focused future. Tesla shares have soared about 3,000% in the past decade, while the S&P 500 has gained more than 230% in the same period.The question, Luria said, is if the retail crowd who backed Tesla a decade ago are right once again about Palantir.The analyst said Palantir's earnings results have been largely strong over the last several years. Palantir's second-quarter report in August — in which the company topped the Street's estimates and raised its full-year guidance due to the AI boom — left him questioning if the stock is worth jumping into despite the lofty multiple. \"Even us most jaded, old, stodgy Wall Street analysts were taken aback by the level of success,\" Luria said. \"It was such a staggering success that I had to reconsider everything I knew.\"Scion Asset Management — the now-de-registered fund run by \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry —  revealed bets against Palantir and fellow AI darling Nvidia in the third quarter. Karp told CNBC that Burry's move was \"bats--- crazy.\"watch nowOvervaluation or destiny?Retail investors are undeterred by the wariness among their institutional counterparts. As Breakout Point's Ćosović put it: where Burry sees \"overvaluation,\" WallStreetBets sees \"destiny.\"Palantir has had its fair share of choppiness this year, falling more than 10% on multiple single trading days. But for stakeholders like Dijamco, the California-based marketer, these fluctuations provide cheaper entry points to buy into a name that they believe in.\"You kind of become a little bit desensitized to the price swings,\" said Dijamco, who plans to purchase thousands of dollars' worth of additional shares on the next big downturn. \"I just have that conviction that it's going to do well.\"",

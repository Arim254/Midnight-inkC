    "body": "Dating is full of tiny money moments: choosing a restaurant, talking about travel, splitting a check, and deciding whether a gift is \"too much.\" You don't need to ask someone how much they make, what their net worth is, or how much student loan debt they carry to learn how they approach money and what kind of financial partner they might be.Talking about money with a potential partner is never just about money. It's about values, habits, and expectations around how someone thinks a \"team\" should work. What not to ask early onOn your first few dates with someone, can you imagine actually asking, \"How much do you make?\" Or, \"What's your net worth?\" I wouldn't be surprised if they excused themselves to the restroom and didn't come back. The irony is, those questions aren't even the best way to get at what you're trying to learn. Someone can earn a lot and still feel financially unstable. Someone can earn less but have excellent systems, habits, and boundaries. The goal is to understand how they think about money and what their values are. 7 money questions to ask on a dateStart with these questions that invite real answers, stories, preferences, and patterns — and reveal their financial mindset more organically.\"Where did you grow up and what was it like?\" It's a basic getting-to-know-you question, but you'll learn a lot about the environment they were raised in, their family norms, and the lifestyle they consider \"normal,\" without forcing them into specifics.\"Tell me about your family. What were they like when you were a kid?\" People will tell you what shaped them if you give them an opening. Pay attention to themes like stability, ambition, generosity, privacy, education, status, faith, and community. These are the things that drive financial decisions.\"What was your first job?\" This is an easy way into someone's relationship with work, motivation, and independence. Did they feel proud, pressured, supported, or alone? Did they work well with other people? Those early experiences tend to show up in adulthood, including how someone thinks about earning and financial stability. A first job often reveals what money represents to them: freedom, security, responsibility, or survival. It can also hint at their default habits, like whether they saved their first paychecks, spent them immediately, or used them to help their family.\"Are you more of a planner or a wing-it person?\" This is a window into how someone handles uncertainty, and money is full of uncertainty. Two people can be completely different here and still work, but it helps to know what you might be signing up for early on — before life gets busy and important financial decisions have to be made.\"What's something you'll happily spend on and something you refuse to overpay for?\" Most people have \"yes\" categories and \"no\" categories that reflect their values. You can learn how they perceive things like convenience, health, quality, experiences, style, generosity, and savings. It's also a great way to talk about spending without getting into budgets.\"What's your ideal vacation?\" Vacation preferences are just as much about money expectations as they are about travel. A \"camping in national parks\" person and a \"boutique hotel and tasting menu\" person can find common ground, but it's helpful to learn early what someone assumes about cost and how they handle it when planning trips with other people. Do they openly talk about a budget before booking, or hope it all just works out?\"When you get stressed, what do you like to do?\" You're not fishing for a perfect answer. You're learning how someone copes with stress, because stress changes how people spend, save, and communicate about money. Some people plan. Some distract. Some shut down. Some spend. The key is whether they recognize their patterns, because self-awareness is what allows us to better manage our behaviors.When to get more directWhen money stops being theoretical and starts showing up in decisions that affect both of you — moving in, splitting regular expenses, building a shared life — it's time to have more direct and specific conversations.Money doesn't have to be a third wheel on your early dates with someone new. Start with questions that reveal how they think and live, and save the hard numbers for when you're building something together. That's how you avoid surprises and set the relationship up to last.Douglas A.

    "body": "Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel (C) takes part in the \"Anti-Imperialist\" protest in front of the US Embassy against the US incursion in Venezuela, where 32 Cuban soldiers lost their lives, in Havana on January 16, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's communist-run government is facing its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on the Caribbean island since the Jan. 3, military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a long-time ally of Cuba's government. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: \"Surrender is not an option.\" He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit \"without pressure or preconditions.\"The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. \"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc,\" Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.The odds are shortening that President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be forced from power in the weeks or months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition.Robert MunksHead of Americas research at Verisk MaplecroftTrump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.Kumaraswami said there was \"of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life,\" but that \"many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged.\"'An accelerating collapse' Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.  A Turkish Airlines plane takes off at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on February 9, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesUnlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans,\" Munks told CNBC by email.The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely \"too little, too late,\" Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on. \"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution,\" Munks said.He added that \"the odds are shortening\" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that \"the regime will try to muddle through\" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.Read moreCuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" last week.\"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.A big test for BRICS Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?\" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.  Cuba acquired \"partner country\" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.The Mexican government has dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba aboard two ships of the Mexican Navy. More than 800 tons of supplies were transported by sea from Asipona, in Veracruz, Mexico, on February 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\" They added that China would, \"as always,\" seek to provide assistance to Cuba.Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The Cuban government is not going to submit,\" Yaffe said. \"The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering.\" She added: \"I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did.\"",

    "body": "Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem of Dubai speaks at a news conference on Nov. 10, 2005 in New York City. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe CEO of Dubai's largest port has been replaced by the company after details of his past relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public.On Friday, DP World announced in a statement that it had appointed Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.The U.S. Department of Justice's latest release of files related to Epstein revealed that the financier once referred to Sulayem as a \"close personal friend\" and called him one of his most trusted friends in other files. Sulayem has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing. A disclosure to Nasdaq Dubai, where DP World maintains listed bonds, said Sulayem had resigned \"effective immediately.\"Sulayem was at the helm of Dubai's largest port operator as chairman since 2007 and CEO since 2016.The statement made no mention of Sulayem but said the company \"affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai's position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.\"CNBC sought comment from Sulayem through DP World, where he served as chairman and CEO, but did not receive a response.Kazim was most recently the governor of the DIFC, Dubai's financial center. Narayan was deputy CEO and CFO at DP World since 2005. Sulayem is one of Dubai's most prominent business figures, coming from one of the Emirate's main families. His father was an advisor to the ruling Al Maktoum family and Sulayem played a key role in the ascendance of Dubai as an economic hub.Sulayem oversaw the growth of Dubai's Jebel Ali port into a major deep-water shipping hub and the expansion of DP World into an international logistics empire that now oversees ports handling a tenth of the world's container trade.He also led Nakheel Properties, a Dubai government-owned developer, though he was replaced amid a major board restructuring following Dubai World's debt issues during the 2008 financial crisis. A 'close personal friend' of Epstein The extent of Sulayem's relationship with Epstein emerged in recent weeks following the release of the latest files.The records show the Emirati businessman was in contact with Epstein after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Authorities have stressed that a mention in the Epstein files does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Jeffrey Epstein and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group CEO of DP World.House Oversight Committee Democrats Pressure from DP World's partnersThis week, pressure mounted on Sulayem to resign after international partners paused new deals with DP World, calling for the company to take the \"required action.\" Canada's second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, which has invested more than $5 billion alongside DP World over the past decade, said it would pause \"additional capital deployment alongside the company.\"In a statement sent to CNBC, La Caisse said it was \"important to distinguish the company, DP World, from the individual, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who is the focus of the current situation.\"\"On that point, we have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions,\" the pension fund added. A spokesperson for British International Investment, which invests with DP World in four African ports, said it would also pause new investments.\"In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.\"",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI, which merged with SpaceX last week, is facing increased pressure from environmental and civil rights groups over pollution concerns, this time at the company's facility in Southaven, Mississippi. On Friday, the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, on behalf of the NAACP, sent a notice of intent to sue xAI and subsidiary MZX Tech LLC, saying the company's use of dozens of natural gas-burning turbines requires a federal permit, violates the Clean Air Act and harms nearby communities. Pollution from the turbines, which xAI has also used in Memphis, Tennessee, for its Colossus 1 and Colossus 2 data centers, has been a major source of local contention for more than a year. Plans for a third data center in Southaven, located about 20 miles from Memphis, were announced early this year, when Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves said he expected the project to create \"hundreds of permanent jobs throughout DeSoto County.\"Launched by Musk in 2023, xAI is trying to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the booming generative AI market. On Feb. 2, Musk said SpaceX, his rocket maker and defense contractor, acquired xAI in a deal that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion. Musk is banking on the area in and around Memphis as the foundation of his AI ambitions, and he's been flouting environmental rules in order to develop as quickly as possible. Musk's social network X, formerly Twitter, is also owned by xAI, which created the Grok AI chatbot and image generator.XAI is currently under a myriad of government investigations in Europe, Asia and the U.S. after Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake porn, including explicit imagery depicting child sexual abuse.  Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their health caused by xAI's use of natural gas turbines. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes in the area.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, had previously said they would sue to stop xAI's un-permitted use of the turbines in Memphis. But they stopped short of filing a legal complaint after Shelby County's health department allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued permits for their use. At the federal level, the EPA recently clarified gray areas of the law and said these turbines can't be categorized as temporary non-road engines. Nonetheless, xAI has been using the turbines across state lines without obtaining federal permits. XAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Noise pollution from the turbines has also been a source of local consternation. Jason Haley, a Southaven resident, told CNBC the turbines make headache-inducing noises around the clock that he can hear inside his home.Haley is part of a group called Safe and Sound which documents the decibel levels, and is pressing local officials to stop xAI from making so much noise, especially overnight, with its turbines.Mississippi officials will hold a public hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, for community members who wish to express their concerns about xAI's expansion plans in the area. The hearing will focus on whether the state should give xAI permission to install and run 41 permanent turbines at its Southaven facility, Mississippi Today previously reported. Similar community dynamics are playing out across the U.S. as tech giants rush to construct massive data centers, which can strain local energy and water supply and cause prices to increase.In November, Microsoft ended efforts to build a data center in Wisconsin due to the community's vocal opposition. Amazon also pulled out of plans for a data center in Arizona after community protests.In terms of Musk's Southaven project, Patrick Anderson, a senior attorney with SELC, said xAI \"has to follow the law, just like any other company.\"\"And when it flouts the Clean Air Act's bedrock protections against unpermitted emissions, it puts the health and welfare of ordinary citizens at risk,\" Anderson said in an email. \"That's why we intend to hold xAI accountable here.\"The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    "body": "watch nowInvestor Matt Shumer ignited a firestorm on social media this week with an essay that warned about the disruptive potential of AI. More than 80 million views later, he said it \"wasn't meant to scare people.\"\"I want to be very clear about this, the article wasn't meant to scare people in this way,\" Shumer told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday. \"If I had known how viral this was going to go, I would have thought about certain parts and rewritten some of the parts for sure.\"The essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" details Shumer's recent experiences using artificial intelligence. In it, he argues that AI's capabilities are under appreciated by the wider public. He compared the state of AI to the rumblings during early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, right before the number of cases soared in the U.S.OpenAI rocketed into mainstream with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and the company kicked off a high-stakes race for dominance among rivals like Google and Anthropic. Investors have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, and Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion on capital expenditures this year alone.He wrote that he's been \"shocked\" to discover that AI can perform all of the actual technical work of his job, and Shumer said professionals across fields like law, finance, medicine and accounting, among others, will begin to share similar experiences. Shumer published the essay on Tuesday. Since then, it has racked up more than 100,000 likes and nearly 6,000 comments, according to X. The essay prompted a range of praise and criticism from readers. In retrospect, Shumer said he would have liked to have framed some parts differently. Even so, Shumer reiterated his belief that AI could be disruptive to many knowledge workers. He said its \"clear\" that AI will be able to do anything that can be done on a computer, though he said it doesn't necessarily mean that it will immediately be adopted or proliferate through society. Shumer said the \"core message\" he is trying to convey is that people in the workforce should start to use and experiment with AI tools so they can understand what's coming. \"Everybody likes to think their thing is special,\" Shumer said. \"I thought my thing was special for a while.\"",

    "body": "New York City shoppers lined up in Greenwich Village on Thursday for the grand opening of The Polymarket, a free grocery store. The market — perhaps a nod to New York mayor Zohran Mamdani's proposed city-run grocery stores — is only operating through 7 p.m. on Sunday. But its namesake sponsor, a prediction market that allows users to trade binary \"yes\" or \"no\" contracts on the outcome of real-world events, from the Super Bowl coin flip to Federal Reserve rate cuts, appears to be here to stay. That didn't always appear to be the case. In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating as an unregistered derivatives market and forced the firm to block U.S. users. The company continued to operate offshore, and in July 2025 spent $112 million to acquire QCEX, the holding company for a regulated and licensed options trading platform. The move paved the way for U.S. federal regulatory approval, which the firm received in November. The firm has relaunched a beta version of its app in the U.S., which is gradually being rolled out to users who sign up to be on a waitlist. Polymarket is not disclosing how many users it currently has. Polymarket and rival prediction market Kalshi are currently embroiled in legal battles at the state level, where regulators in states including Nevada, New York and New Jersey say that trading event contracts on sports amounts to gambling that falls under state jurisdiction and is taxed differently than financial markets. State regulators in Massachusetts recently won an injunction against Kalshi in court, which temporarily banned the firm from offering sports-related contracts in the state.In response to the lawsuit, a Kalshi spokesperson told CNBC, \"Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi's innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.\" The company said it is \"ready to defend [its technology] once again in a court of law.\"This week Polymarket filed a lawsuit against the state, in which the company's representatives say Polymarket hopes to avoid \"imminent and irreparable harm arising from Massachusetts's enforcement of state gambling laws against federally regulated derivatives exchanges.\"In the meantime, customer money continues to pour in. Kalshi's CEO estimated the firm saw more than $1 billion in trades on the Super Bowl. That includes $100 million in trades coming on which song halftime performer Bad Bunny would perform first alone.The mechanics of prediction marketsSo how does this all work? Prediction markets run on event contracts, financial instruments that essentially let you buy a share in the outcome of an event. The price of those shares ranges between $0 and $1, with the value reflecting the likelihood of your chosen outcome coming to fruition.Ahead of the Super Bowl, contracts predicting that the Seattle Seahawks would win on both Polymarket and Kalshi cost $0.68, per Barron's, implying a 68% chance of a Seattle victory according to these markets. At the game's final whistle, all Seattle contracts bought at any price went to $1 per share. All New England Patriots contracts went to $0.Unlike a traditional casino, those buying events contracts aren't playing against the \"house.\" Rather, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi allow traders to buy and sell contracts among themselves, with the companies collecting a small fee on each trade. The more money piles in on the \"yes\" or \"no\" side of a particular event, the more expensive that contract gets. For example, shares predicting a Seahawks victory in the Super Bowl, increased closer and closer to $1 the more it became apparent that Seattle was going to win. Importantly, investors can buy or sell their options at any time before the event is over. Say you picked \"yes\" on a fringe political candidate to win an election at $0.05. Then, a month later, that candidate made a landmark speech that boosted popularity. After more money comes in on your candidate, the price is now $0.10. You could hang onto your shares if you think they may go higher (or actually win) or you could sell them for double what you paid. Essentially, these markets provide real-time odds on future events, according to a crowdsourced pool of people who have skin in the game. On some level this has always been the case, says Stephane Ouellette, co-founder and CEO of digital asset investment bank FRNT Financial. Some who understood the intricacies of oil futures, for instance, could suss out whether political tensions in the Middle East might boil over, he says. \"There's been a huge innovation where now we're turning these markets into more digestible information that a retail trader can now understand,\" Ouellette says. \"Whereas before you needed like a Ph.D. in market analysis to be able to figure this out.\"Tread carefully putting money behind your predictions, experts sayWhether buying contracts on prediction markets constitutes gambling akin to making a bet with a sportsbook is up for legal debate. But the distinction is moot when it comes to investing and managing your money, says Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management. \"It's that old adage, you've got to know how much you're willing to lose,\" he says. \"It's no different than if you go to Vegas with your friends.\"  Of course, no matter how convicted you may feel on the future outcome of a particular event, you'd be wise to not make prediction contracts a major part of your investing strategy, financial pros say. At most, they belong in an \"opportunity portfolio,\" says Doug Boneparth, a CFP and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. This sleeve of your portfolio, which might constitute 5% to 10% of your investable assets, is reserved for riskier plays such as individual stocks, cryptocurrencies, niche exchange-traded funds and maybe a prediction or two, Boneparth says. The rest of it generally belongs in a broadly diversified portfolio of investments you plan to buy and hold for the long term, he says. The thinking here is that, even if your predictions end up going to zero, the loss won't be enough to derail your financial plans. \"Most retail investors should be approaching investing as a long-term consistency and discipline game. That's how you quietly compound your returns over time,\" Boneparth says. \"So while [prediction markets] may be a piece of the puzzle, and I think it's a little bit of a stretch, it definitely would go into that more speculatory opportunity bucket.\"Johnson recommends thinking of prediction markets as part of your entertainment budget, the same way you might think about what you spend each month on a hobby like golf. That way, you're doing it for fun, and whether you turn a profit on your predictions is incidental, he says.\"If I make money, great,\" he says. \"But when you start getting into, 'I'm going to do this because I'm smarter than everybody else, and I'm going to pay my mortgage with it,' that's when you that's you have a problem.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a minority investment.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to board Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit. The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that \"the tide is turning\" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.\"Trump's grip on power is slipping,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. \"Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families.\"The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy,\" Leavitt said via email.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement \"surge\" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets. A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.\"The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion. Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway. The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.",

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright speak with the media after attending a meeting, marking the highest-level U.S. visit focused on energy policy to the OPEC nation in nearly three decades, as Washington conducts its first on-the-ground assessment of the oil industry it aims to help rebuild, in Caracas, Venezuela, Feb. 11, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersVenezuela oil revenue will no longer be deposited in an account in Qatar, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told NBC News in an interview this week. \"An account was set up in Qatar, controlled by the U.S. government the whole time, to land that money in and then send the money from there down to Venezuela,\" Wright told NBC News on Thursday. \"Now we have an account at the U.S. Treasury. The money won't go to Qatar anymore,\" the energy secretary said.The Trump administration has taken control of Venezuela's oil sales after capturing former President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid last month. Wright met Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in Venezuela this week, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country in decades. Wright told NBC News that revenue from Venezuelan oil sales now tops $1 billion. The U.S. has short-term agreements to sell another $5 billion of the country's crude over the next few months, he said. The oil has gone to U.S. refineries and Europe so far, he said. The U.S. deposited the initial $500 million of oil sales in the Qatar account before transferring the funds back to Venezuela, Wright said. Democrats in Congress have questioned the transparency and legality of the arrangement. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced legislation Thursday that directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent audit of the Qatar account.  watch nowWright said the U.S. deposited the initial sales in Qatar because the funds face the risk of Venezuela's creditors attempting to claim them. Caracas faces tens of billions of dollars in outstanding claims from defaulting on its sovereign debt and nationalizing the assets of oil companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. \"Since Venezuela has so many creditors and they owe a lot of money, we had some risk if we put it into a U.S. bank account set up quickly that creditors could freeze that money,\" Wright said. \"We want those creditors ultimately to get their money back, but that money urgently needs to get to Venezuela.\"The U.S. faces the added complication that it does not officially recognize the government led by Rodríguez. President Donald Trump recognized the 2015 opposition-led National Assembly during his first term in 2019. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 28 that Washington must find a way to resolve the issue of government recognition for the funds to be deposited in the U.S.\"You have to recognize a government, but we don't recognize this government,\" Rubio said. \"We recognize the 2015 National Assembly, so we have to find some creative way legally to meet that standard.\"Venezuelan oil revenue deposited in the U.S. should in theory be under the control of the opposition National Assembly due to Trump's recognition, said Scott Anderson, an international law expert who previously served with the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under President Barack Obama.This raises the question of which government the U.S. will ultimately recognize and when. Wright told NBC that elections and a transition of power will likely happen in Venezuela during Trump's term. He said U.S. government oversight of Venezuela's domestic affairs would conclude at that point. \"It is a question of a process to get there,\" Wright said. \"Ultimately, what the long-term political leadership in Venezuela is going to be, it's going to be up to Venezuela.\"",

Instacart is facing an increasingly competitive market as retailers like Amazon and food platforms such as Uber Eats and Doordash aggressively scale in grocery delivery. At the same time, the company is investing in new technology and artificial intelligence tools to drive more customers and businesses to its platform. Wall Street analysts viewed Instacart's results as a wave of confidence for those worried about the company's moat.

Liddell previously served as the chief financial officer of Microsoft, the vice chairman of General Motors and the deputy White House chief of staff during President Donald Trump's first term. He has also been involved in three presidential transition cycles, according to his website.  Anthropic's decision to add Liddell to its board could foster some goodwill with the Trump administration, which has lashed out at the artificial intelligence startup in recent months. David Sacks, the venture capitalist serving as the administration's AI and crypto czar, accused Anthropic of supporting \"woke AI\" in October because of its stance on regulation.\"My career has taught me the governance of transformative technologies matters as much as the technologies themselves,\" Liddell said in a statement on Friday. \"Anthropic's approach — building AI that's both capable and responsible — is critical for our future, and it's why I'm proud to be joining the company's Board.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. leadOn Thursday, Anthropic announced that it would contribute $20 million to Public First Action, which backs pro-AI regulation candidates, including Republicans Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Pete Ricketts from Nebraska.Trump signed an executive order in December to push for a single regulatory framework for AI, establishing a litigation task force to challenge state AI laws, namely those led by Democratic lawmakers.Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers in 2021, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude.

    "body": "The Alibaba stand at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition Center in Shanghai, China, on July 5, 2024.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhile U.S. markets have been focused on the impact of Anthropic and Altruist's tools on software and financial services, China's tech giants have released AI models this week that have shown advancements in robotics and video generation.Alibaba, TikTok creator ByteDance and short-video platform Kuaishou, have all released new AI models that underscore how Chinese firms are keeping up with those in the U.S.It comes after Google DeepMind boss Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models are just \"months\" behind Western rivals. These models from China are directly competing with video generation models such as OpenAI's Sora, as well as robotics models from Nvidia and Google. Here's a rundown of the models.watch nowAlibaba's RynnBrainAlibaba's DAMO Academy unveiled RynnBrain this week, an AI model designed to help robots comprehend the physical world around them and identify objects.In a video demo, Alibaba showed a robot with pincers for hands that appeared to be able to count oranges, pick them up and place them in a basket. It was also shown taking milk out of a fridge.Models require extensive training to enable them to identify everyday objects to interact with, which means that simple tasks like picking up fruit can be challenging in robotics.RynnBrain now puts Alibaba in competition with the likes of Nvidia and Google which are developing their own AI models for robots.\"One of its key innovations is built-in time and space awareness,\" Adina Yakefu, a researcher at Hugging Face, told CNBC.\"Instead of simply reacting to immediate inputs, the robot can remember when and where events occurred, track task progress, and continue across multiple steps. This makes it more reliable and coherent in complex real-world environments.\"Yakefu added that Alibaba's \"broader ambition\" was to \"establish a foundational intelligence layer for embodied systems.\"ByteDance's Seedance 2.0Seedance 2.0 is a video generation AI model capable of generating a realistic video from just a text prompt from a user. But prompts can also contain other videos and images. Videos created with Seedance 2.0 and reviewed by CNBC appear to show quite realistic imagery and video that has been fully created with AI.Billy Boman, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and runs a creative advertising agency that produces AI-generated content, has used Seedance 2.0.He said AI video generation has made significant strides over the past two years, with rapid improvements across the industry.watch now\"Back in 2023 … it was difficult to get someone to run or to walk. Any type of realism was [limited to] very short clips, everything was very slow, bad textures, no skin textures, lacking detail. Now the script has flipped. Now I can do anything. It has been nothing short of exceptional, the technological advancements,\" Boman told CNBC in an interview. Hugging Face's Yakefu, added that the Seedance 2.0 model has shown progress from previous generations in \"controllability, speed and production efficiency.\"\"Seedance 2.0 is one of the most well-rounded video generation models I've tested so far. It genuinely surprised me by delivering satisfying results on the first try, even with a simple prompt. The visuals, music, and cinematography come together in a way that feels polished rather than experimental,\" Yakefu said.However, while users have praised the technology, Seedance has run into trouble. Local Chinese media reported that Seedance has suspended a feature that allowed the AI to generate the voice of a person based on a picture they uploaded. It came after a blogger in China raised concerns about the voice generation taking place without consent. ByteDance was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Kuaishou's Kling 3.0Released last week, Kuaishou's Kling 3.0 is another video generation model to rival ByteDance's. Kling 3.0 \"features major upgrades in consistency, photorealistic output, extended video duration up to 15s, and native audio generation across multiple languages, dialects, and accents.The model is only available to paying subscribers but will be available to the public soon, Kuaishou said.Kuaishou's success with its Kling models has been a key factor behind its more than 50% share price rise over the last year. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKuaishou shares year-to-dateOther key AI model releasesZhipu AI — which trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology in Hong Kong — saw its shares surge on Thursday after it released GLM-5, an open-source large-language model with enhanced coding capabilities and long-running agent tasks.The company said the model approaches Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in coding benchmarks while surpassing Google's Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. CNBC could not verify those claims. Shares of MiniMax also jumped Thursday after it launched its updated M2.5 open-source model with enhanced AI agent tools. \"Agents\" or \"agentic AI\" refers to AI tools designed to automate tasks. — CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 14, 2026.Thilo Schmuelgen | ReutersThe U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday.\"We care deeply about your future and ours,\" Rubio told the Munich Security Conference (MSC).\"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.\"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt,\" Rubio said.The U.S.'s top diplomat told the gathering of European leaders that American leadership has succeeded in resolving thorny issues such as the Israel-Gaza conflict and made progress in ending Russia's war with Ukraine which multilateral organizations including the U.N. have so far failed to.\"The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world, but we cannot ignore that today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role. It could not solve the war in Gaza,\" Rubio said. \"Instead, it was American leadership that freed captives from barbarians and brought about a fragile truce. It has not solved the war in Ukraine.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during the 62nd Munich Security Conference (MSC) on February 14, 2026 in Munich, southern Germany. (Photo by THOMAS KIENZLE / AFP via Getty Images)Thomas Kienzle | Afp | Getty ImagesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the U.S. for its help in Ukraine's fight against Russia.\"I am grateful to every American heart that was helping us no matter what. Thank you. Without you, Americans, Europeans and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on,\" Zelenskyy said to applause.But he criticized the administration of Trump's predecessor for being slow to ramp up military aid to Ukraine. Zelenskyy also had harsh words for Iran's government, which he accused of supplying the drones Russia uses to attack Ukrainian territory.\"Ukraine does not share a border with Iran and we have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime,\" Zelenskyy said. \"But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing, especially, our people, Ukrainians, and destroying our infrastructure.\"NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, speaking next to Zelenskyy, urged member countries to step up military support for Ukraine under the alliance's Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative.\"Keep (Ukraine) strong in the fight. They will do it, but they need our support,\" Rutte said.European independenceEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking after Rubio at the conference, said the region faces \"the very distinct threat of outside forces trying to weaken our union from within, the return of overtly hostile competition and power relations.\"Von der Leyen said Europe needs to become more independent \"in every dimension that affects our security and prosperity, defense and energy, economy and trade, raw materials and digital tech.\"But she emphasized that that does not mean weakening the trans-Atlantic bond.\"The opposite is true and we've just heard it from State Secretary Rubio. An independent Europe is a strong Europe and a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance.\"On Friday, the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, urged European leaders to stand up to Russian aggression.\"The lesson learned is that appeasement always brings new wars,\" Kallas told CNBC in an interview. \"That's very clear. If you think that, okay, let them have this territory. ... We will have peace that is actually never going to work. It actually increases the appetite. They walked away with more territory, more valuables, than they had before.\"watch nowAlso speaking to CNBC on Friday ahead of the conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, the organization's chairman, said it was Europe's \"own fault\" that its power on the global stage has been diminished.\"Europe has failed to speak with one voice to China and about China, Europe has failed with one voice, to come up with a clear concept about the future of the Middle East, including about how to deal or not to deal with the Iranian nuclear question,\" said Ischinger, who is a former German ambassador to the U.S.Earlier this week, the MSC published its 2026 report, for which Ischinger wrote the foreword. It warned that \"the world has entered a period of wrecking-ball politics,\" where \"sweeping destruction … is the order of the day.\"The report said that Trump was \"at the forefront of those who promise to free their countries from the existing order's constraints and rebuild stronger, more prosperous nations,\" arguing he was just one movement \"driven by resentment and regret over the liberal trajectory their societies have embarked on.\"Ischinger said that Europeans were \"totally on the sidelines\" on negotiations around Gaza and Ukraine.Economic cooperationRubio said the U.S. sought a \"reinvigorated alliance\" with Europe, \"one that does not maintain the polite pretense that our way of life is just one among many and that asks for permission before it acts.\"In a wide-ranging speech, Rubio criticized past policies that encouraged mass migration, outsourced supply chains and contributed to \"deindustrialization,\" which he said was \"not inevitable.\"\"It was a conscious policy choice, a decades-long economic undertaking that stripped our nations of their wealth, of their productive capacity, and of their independence. And the loss of our supply chain sovereignty was not a function of a prosperous and healthy system of global trade. It was foolish,\" Rubio said.Rubio also discussed how greater trans-Atlantic cooperation could reposition the West to lead in 21st-Century industries.\"Together, we can reindustrialize our economies and rebuild our capacity to defend our people,\" he said.\"Commercial space travel and cutting-edge artificial intelligence, industrial automation and flex manufacturing, creating a Western supply chain for critical minerals not vulnerable to extortion from other powers, and a unified effort to compete for market share in the economies of the global South.\"",

That added about $56 per month on average for retirees, and for some beneficiaries, higher Medicare premiums offset that increase.Now, new government inflation data for January suggests the cost-of-living adjustment for 2027 may be even lower, if the pace of inflation stays the same in the coming months.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsFollowing Super Bowl ad, Trump accounts launch a new sign-up optionSome student loan borrowers wait over a year for public servant debt forgivenessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe 2026 COLA affects around 75 million beneficiaries, according to the Social Security Administration.Estimates range from 1.2% to 3.1%The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment may be just 1.2% in 2027, estimates Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. If that increase were to go into effect, it would be the lowest COLA since a 0.3% increase to benefits in 2017.Separately, the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior group, now projects a 2.8% Social Security COLA for 2027, consistent with the benefit boost beneficiaries saw for this year. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office has forecast a 3.1% Social Security COLA for next year, followed by 2.5% the following year, as part of its estimates on the program's future costs.Low COLA would 'exacerbate' financial stressIf the COLA landed at 2.8%, \"this paltry figure would only exacerbate seniors' financial stress,\" the Senior Citizens League states. The group's polling has found more than half of seniors — almost 58% — have skipped at least one health care product or service in the past 12 months to cut costs.A separate September AARP survey found that a 3% COLA is \"insufficient.\"The organization asked about 1,000 adults ages 50 and older what they thought of a then-estimated 3% increase and found 77% of respondents said that was not enough to keep up with rising prices. Most respondents — 72% — said the ideal benefit boost would be 5% or higher.watch nowTo be sure, the current COLA projections are preliminary and subject to change.The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment is calculated each year using third-quarter data for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Third-quarter CPI-W data for the current year is compared to the third quarter of the previous year. The percentage increase from one year to the next, if there is one, determines the COLA. New CPI data for January shows the CPI-W increased 2.2% over the previous 12 months. ",

    "body": "Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSpotify is officially bringing video podcasts to Netflix.The partnership will bring a selection of podcasts from The Ringer, a network acquired by Spotify in 2020, to the streaming company in early 2026 for U.S. users.The podcasts will range from sports to culture to true crime, aiming to both complement Netflix's current slate and bring in new audiences, pulling from The Ringer's lineup. The companies said more markets outside of the U.S. are in the pipeline.\"This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\" Spotify's Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller said in a statement. \"Together with Netflix, we're expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences, and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.\"Lauren Smith, Netflix's vice president of content licensing and programming strategy, said the curated selection \"adds fresh voices and new perspectives to Netflix.\"The shows coming to Netflix include \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables\" and \"Serial Killers,\" with more expected after the initial launch.Spotify said the move is the next step in evolving the company into a multimedia experience, with more initiatives planned in the future to \"bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators.\"Tuesday's announcement comes as media companies have turned to video podcasts as the next big thing among their audiences. In particular, video podcasts have soared in popularity on Google's YouTube, which is increasingly nabbing a bigger share of viewership.This has led traditional media and streaming companies to lean into the medium.At this year's Upfront advertising presentations, some companies, including Amazon's Prime Video, noted the recent success of podcast content as creators sign multimillion dollar deals and garner millions of followers and views.On an April earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is \"constantly looking at all different types of content.\" Sarandos added that the line between podcasts and talk shows is becoming increasingly blurred. \"We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love,\" Sarandos said. \"Podcasts ... have become a lot more video-forward.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

    "body": "There's a sharp divide between what Gen Z values and what hiring managers are actually looking for.My team at Becoming You Labs recently conducted a study using our values-assessment tool, The Values Bridge, which ranks 16 values using 100 behavioral questions. Since May, over 77,000 people have taken it. We then cross-referenced the study with a national survey of 2,100 hiring managers across industries like tech, consulting, banking, and professional services. (Read more about our research here.)The disconnect was clear — and pretty stark: Gen Z's top three values are self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people. The people hiring them, on the other hand, are looking for employees who value achievement, learning, and hard work. When you cross-reference the two studies, only 2% of Gen Z shares their bosses' priorities.In response to the findings, one CEO said: \"This explains exactly why we can't hire.\" A hospital executive put it more bluntly: \"We are now hiring two or three new docs to replace a retiring one. They tell us we should not be expecting them to work hard because life as a cardiologist isn't what it used to be.\"One head of HR summed all the comments up with the line: \"This is crazy. And confirming.\"Gen Z's response? Starkly different. One recent grad on TikTok: \"Why would we want to live by Boomer values when their values ruined the world?\" Another added: \"Old people hate young people because our lives prove theirs were wasted. I'm not going to wish I worked more on my deathbed.\"The intensity of the debate didn't shock me. I've watched this clash build for years — in classrooms and in boardrooms. Companies are frustrated. Young people are frustrated. And looming over it all? AI, threatening to replace the few entry-level jobs Gen Z already struggles to land.Given this context, what's an \"unemployable\" (as one WSJ headline put it) Gen Zer supposed to do? Nobody wants to suppress their values, and that's understandable. But most people can't go without work. Is there a way forward for the 98% of Gen Zers who put self-care, authenticity, and altruism above company success and career propulsion?Here's my advice for the vast majority of Gen Zers stuck in what probably feels like a very untenable place.1. Come to terms with the value you place on wealthWhen I teach my class \"Becoming You\" at NYU Stern School of Business, I don't let students self-report when it comes to their desire for wealth. The reason is simple: People rarely tell the truth about their relationship with money — to themselves and others — because there's thought to be a faint stink off of wanting to be rich.But you cannot make any sustainable career decisions without getting very honest about the number in your head. That is, the amount of money you want and need to feel, \"That's enough.\" It could be \"one good vacation a year,\" as a student once put it, it could be as another admitted, \"one private helicopter per kid.\"My research shows that 42% of Gen Z has affluence in their top five values, 35% consider it a moderate value, and 23% have it in their bottom five values.Once you know where affluence ranks for you, you can make more thoughtful choices about whether to nudge yourself toward the 2% or not. After all, even with self-care as a top value, if wealth is close behind, something has to give. On the other hand, if wealth ranks No. 10 or even No. 16, a whole different world of work enters your realm of possibilities.2. Join or start a company that accommodates your valuesIf you do not want to suppress your values, your best strategy is to find a company that supports the ones you already have.Keep your eyes open for the published lists of businesses that are said to support employee well-being, authenticity, and giving back. Just know that these companies are often magnets for job-seekers. If you end up applying to one, make sure to level up with an excellent cover letter and top-notch resume.Then there's entrepreneurship. As a two-time founder myself, I know how grueling it can be. But if you have the right idea, with market fit and the stamina to match, creating your own workplace culture is the surest way to be able to live by your values.3. Make a decade-long deal with yourselfI rarely suggest people try to change their values. It's like changing your personality; it usually doesn't stick. But if landing a job is an urgent priority, and affluence is a long-range one, you may choose to suppress your desire for wellbeing, balance, and authentic self-expression for a period of time and embrace achievement and workcentrism.In other words, make like the Boomers and say hello to delayed gratification.My word of warning, however, is if you follow this strategy, don't dabble and don't relitigate your decision daily. Instead, commit. And commit for long enough to see results. I recommend a full decade. Overnight success is a myth, even for those in the 2%.How much you live by your values is one of the most personal, consequential choices you'll ever make. That choice can shape your income, your sense of purpose, and the arc of your career. Approach it not with panic or resignation, but with the wisdom of your years — both the ones you've already lived and the many still ahead.Suzy Welch is an award-winning NYU Stern School of Business professor, acclaimed researcher, popular podcaster and three-time NYT best-selling author, most recently with \"Becoming You: A Proven Method for Crafting Your Authentic Life and Career.\" A graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, Dr. Welch is a frequent guest of the Today Show and an op-ed contributor to the Wall Street Journal.

    "body": "Travis Hutchison, a soybean farmer, unloads his cargo from his family's truck at a local grain dealer in Queen Anne, Maryland, on Oct. 10, 2025. Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.China is committing an \"Economically Hostile Act\" by \"purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.Ending business with China on cooking oil and \"other elements of Trade\" are possible forms of \"retribution\" that Trump said he was weighing.\"As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don't need to purchase it from China,\" he wrote.China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, importing some 27 million metric tons valued at nearly $12.8 billion in 2024 alone.But amid a simmering trade war with the Trump administration, Beijing has not bought a single American soybean since May.With retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods making soybeans pricier for Chinese importers, China has been sourcing the crop instead from producers in South America.One of those suppliers is Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes on the same day that the Trump administration first pledged to bolster the country's economy with a $20 billion currency swap.Argentina President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday, hours before the U.S. leader issued his latest salvo against China.Meanwhile, China's exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total.Trump's social media post follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.The S&P 500 stock index fell immediately after Trump's post, ending the trading day in the red after a volatile session.Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to massively increase tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals. Later that day, Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1.But on Sunday, Trump appeared to soften his attack, writing, \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\"Stocks broadly rebounded on Monday.",

    "body": "watch nowChina's sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports threaten the U.S. defense industry, providing President Xi Jinping with powerful leverage over President Donald Trump in upcoming trade talks.Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"What this essentially means is that it will deny licenses to foreign militaries and companies that are producing military use end goods,\" Baskaran told CNBC. \"It undermines the development of the defense industrial base at a time when there is rising global tension. It is a very powerful negotiating tactic because it undermines national security.\"Rare earth magnets are crucial components in U.S. weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Virginia and Columbia class submarines, Predator drones, Tomahawk missiles, radar, and the joint direct attack munition series of smart bombs, according to the Department of Defense.China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths. It controls 60% of mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for around 70% of its rare earth imports, according the U.S. Geological Survey.\"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve, that we let China monopolize 90% of the refining of rare earth materials,\" Jeremy Siegel, University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus of finance, told CNBC on Monday. \"Where were we?\"'Massively disruptive'Beijing also imposed broad controls that require foreign companies to obtain an export license if rare earths processed in China make up as little as 0.1% of their products' value. Firms will also need licenses for products that rely on Chinese rare earth technology for mining, smelting, separation, magnet manufacturing and recycling.\"If these rules were to be strictly and indefinitely enforced, they would be massively disruptive, not just to the US but globally,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 10 note. Rare earths are also crucial inputs for the semiconductor and automobile industries.The restrictions would impact every sector of the U.S. economy but the defense, semiconductor and electric vehicle industries would face the brunt, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, an economist at French investment bank Natixis. Defense contractors, Apple, Nvidia, Intel, Tesla, Ford and GM are all highly exposed, Hererro told clients in a Monday note.The Trump administration is working to build out a domestic supply chain. The Defense Department struck an unprecedented deal with the largest U.S. rare earth miner MP Materials in July that included an equity stake, price floors and an offtake agreement.\"This will certainly also further accelerate US efforts to develop our own rare earth resources,\" Marcus said. U.S. rare earth stocks have surged as investors speculate that the Trump administration will strike deals with other miners.Standoff in South KoreaThe restrictions threaten to reignite the trade war between China and the U.S. after months of relative calm.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1. The huge import taxes would come on top of the 44% tariff rate already in place on China, effectively cutting off trade between the world's two largest economies, according to Wolfe Research.\"It wouldn't take much re-escalation to get us back to the quasi-embargo situation that prevailed in the spring,\" Marcus told clients.The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value Friday after Trump threatened massive tariffs against China, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The S&P 500 rallied Monday to regain more than half of Friday's losses after Trump appeared to de-escalate, saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.Trump and Xi are still expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea, later this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Monday.The most likely scenario is \"both sides pull back on the most aggressive policies and that talks lead to a further—and possibly indefinite—extension of the tariff escalation pause reached in May,\" Goldman Sachs told clients Sunday.But Beijing's strategy is unclear and the tariff deadline is just weeks away, raising the risk that an agreement might not be struck in time, Marcus said.\"Without more conviction about Beijing's strategy here, we're concerned that they won't be willing to back down fast enough to prevent these 100% tariffs from kicking in, at least temporarily,\" the analyst said.",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Tuesday topped analysts' estimates for the third quarter as trading and investment banking generated about $700 million more revenue than expected.Here's what the company reported:Earnings per share: $5.07 vs. expected $4.84, according to LSEGRevenue: $47.12 billion vs. expected $45.4 billion, according to LSEGThe bank said in a release that profit jumped 12% to $14.39 billion, or $5.07 per share, from a year earlier. Revenue rose 9% to $47.12 billion.So far this year, the biggest American banks have benefited under the administration of President Donald Trump.They've reaped higher trading revenue as upheaval from his policies has roiled markets around the world, forcing investors to reposition themselves. JPMorgan's trading haul of $8.9 billion was a record for a third quarter, CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.Investment bankers are busier thanks to a more relaxed stance toward mergers, and Trump's bank regulators have proposed ways to ease capital requirements and stress tests. Stock market indexes that are at or near record levels have helped the wealth management divisions of banks including JPMorgan.Fixed income trading at JPMorgan jumped 21% in the quarter to $5.6 billion, about $300 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.Equity trading surged 33% to $3.3 billion, also roughly $300 million more than expected.Investment banking fees jumped 16% to $2.6 billion, edging out the $2.5 billion StreetAccount estimate.Dimon said that while each of his major business lines performed well against a good economic backdrop, he was preparing the firm for possible turbulence ahead.\"While there have been some signs of a softening, particularly in job growth, the U.S. economy generally remained resilient,\" Dimon said.\"However, there continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation,\" Dimon said. \"As always, we hope for the best, but these complex forces reinforce why we prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios.\"JPMorgan's provision for credit losses rose 9% to $3.4 billion, exceeding the $3.08 billion estimate, indicating that the firm is preparing for higher loan defaults down the road.Big banks have outperformed regional lenders so far this year; the KBW Bank Index has climbed nearly 15%, while the KBW Regional Banking Index has dropped roughly 1%.Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also reported earnings Tuesday, with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley releasing results Wednesday.This story is developing.

    "body": "Benoit Tessier | ReutersThe Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by a man who oversaw a massive \"pig butchering\" fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said Tuesday.The seizure is the largest forfeiture action by the DOJ in history.An indictment charging the alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.Zhi, who is also known as \"Vincent,\" remains at large, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.He was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which prosecutors said grew \"in secret .... into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations. U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella said that Zhi \"directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions.\"\"Prince Group's investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world, including here in New York, on the backs of individuals who have been trafficked and forced to work against their will,\" Nocella said.The Prince Group, which operates businesses in more than 30 countries, ran \"forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a press release.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New York\"Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as 'pig butchering' scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world,\" the release said.The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office.\"In reality, the funds were stolen from the victims and laundered for the benefit of the perpetrators,\" the release said. \"The scam perpetrators often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds.\"Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, \"often under the threat of violence.\"Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.",

    "body": "2026 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepDETROIT – Jeep is overhauling its top-end Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year under a yearslong turnaround plan for the quintessential American SUV brand.The changes include updating exterior styling, introducing a new forthcoming extended-range powertrain and creating a simplified, less expensive model lineup all under the \"Grand Wagoneer\" name. Jeep will also kill off the standalone \"Wagoneer\" nameplate.\"This marks a significant portfolio moment in refining our flagship SUV to reach a broader audience,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said during a media event.Since launching in 2021, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer have not lived up to expectations. Initial production of the vehicles was riddled with problems and the dual nameplates for the same-looking vehicles confused consumers.2022 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepThe initial pricing for those vehicles also could top $111,000 — which had been unexplored territory for the brand known for rugged SUVs — and they featured a host of tiered trim levels that complicated ordering.\"We confused our buyers. We confused our dealers,\" Broderdorf said. \"I'm here to tell you we got the message. We're fixing it.\"The 2026 Grand Wagoneer will start under $65,000, including mandatory destination charges. That is similar to where the Wagoneer currently starts in pricing, but Jeep said it includes additional features and is more in line with competitors' pricing.\"I'm here to win,\" Broderdorf said. \"I want to come out very, very fast and see what we can do to really gain some share and continue to grow the brand … that was the mission for me.\"2026 Jeep Grand Wagoneer JeepJeep, owned by French-Italian-American automaker Stellantis, said it expects to the Grand Wagoneer to be the first SUV with a plug-in technology known as a range-extender, or EREV. It can operate as a zero-emissions EV until its battery dies and an electric onboard generator — powered by a 27-gallon, 3.6-liter V6 engine — kicks on to power the vehicle.Stellantis' Ram Trucks brand was expected to be the first to launch an EREV model, but after several delays and the brand conducting its own turnaround plan, the Jeep model is expected to be the first EREV available beginning next year.Jeep is one of the most crucial of Stellantis' 14 brands — if not the most important in North America. The revamped Grand Wagoneer is the second of four major product announcements that began this summer with the reveal of its new Jeep Cherokee SUV.The turnaround plan also has included reworking pricing of Jeep SUVs, which inflated in recent years above market norms, and re-engaging with its alienated dealer network amid a lack of new products and declining sales.So far, Jeep's U.S. sales are moving in the right direction. The brand is on track to report its first year-over-year sales gain since 2018, when it recorded all-time high sales of more than 973,000 vehicles. That compares to 587,725 units sold last year, a 40% drop from Jeep's sales peak.\"Quite frankly, my only interest is growing this brand and doing so in a very fun, historical Jeep way,\" said Broderdorf, who succeeded now-Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in leading Jeep in February.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday.\"A lot depends on what the Chinese do,\" Greer told CNBC in an interview. \"They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation.\"China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented.Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week,  saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.\"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains,\" the U.S. trade representative said.Trump, Xi scheduled to meetThe restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.\"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese,\" Greer said of the meeting. \"But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can.\"U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.\"We think we'll be able to work through it,\" Greer said of the trade dispute.'We want to work with the Chinese'The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.\"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information,\" Greer said. \"You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese.\"Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

    "body": "A new Jeep Wrangler 4-Door Sahara 4x4 vehicle displayed for sale at a Stellantis NV dealership in Miami, Florida, US, on Saturday, April 5, 2025.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and other auto brands, plans to invest $13 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years, as the company executes a domestic turnaround under CEO Antonio Filosa.The trans-Atlantic automaker on Tuesday said the investments will add more than 5,000 jobs to its domestic workforce and increase domestic production by 50%. The plans include bringing new vehicles to plants in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio through 2029.U.S.-listed shares of Stellantis rose more than 5% in after-hours trading Tuesday. The company's stock is off 24% this year.The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump's efforts to create more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. through the use of aggressive tariffs, especially for the automotive industry. The company said the plans expand those Stellantis Chair John Elkann detailed to Trump in January.\"Since day one, me and the team set out a clear priority that was to grow in the largest market that we operate, which is the U.S.,\" Filosa, who led the company's North American operations before starting as CEO on June 23, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"We know what we need to do to grow this market.\"Incoming Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, head of the company's Americas operations, greets a Windsor Assembly Plant employee during an event celebrating Chrysler’s 100th anniversary on June 6, 2025.StellantisThe company's U.S. sales peaked in 2018, when it was known as Fiat Chrysler, at more than 2.2 million vehicles. Sales last year were down 42% since then as the company and its former CEO Carlos Tavares, who was ousted late last year, focused on profits over volumes.Stellantis' new vehicles under the investments include a midsize truck for a plant in Toledo, Ohio; two new Jeep vehicles for a shuttered facility in Belvidere, Illinois; and a next-generation version of the Dodge Durango SUV and \"an all-new range-extended EV and internal combustion engine large SUV\" at plants in Michigan.Other investments include research and development and supplier costs to execute the company's new product strategy, as well as additional investments in the company's U.S. powertrain hub in Kokomo, Indiana.Filosa said the investment decisions were a result of discussions with the company's new leadership team as well as stakeholders such as the company's franchised dealer network. He downplayed tariffs as a main driver for the decisions, saying automakers need to make long-term plans.It's not immediately clear how many of the investments and jobs are new or how many have been previously announced as part of the company's 2023 contract with the United Auto Workers union that included $18.9 billion in new investments by April 2028.But there are some differences. For example, a midsize truck was previously planned for Stellantis' Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois through a $1.5 billion investment. That vehicle, or a different midsize truck, is now expected to be added to the company's plant in Toledo through a $400 million investment.The investments cover most of the company's main U.S. manufacturing plants. Stellantis' U.S. footprint includes 34 manufacturing facilities, parts distribution centers and research and development locations across 14 states. The operations employ more than 48,000 people, according to the company.",

Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmericans have vastly different views of the economy — and the divergence is being driven in part by income bracket, data shows.Higher-income consumers were more likely to report stronger economic confidence readings when asked to consider the next year given changes since the presidential election, according to JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey.This release adds to a growing body of qualitative and quantitative evidence showing the U.S. economy is in a \"K-shape,\" a term used by economists to describe the deviation in economic experiences by income. In other words, it can explain why well-off Americans are continuing to spend while lower earners buckle under inflationary pressures.\"Survey results indicated a notable bifurcation,\" JPMorgan's Matthew Boss, a widely followed and respected consumer analyst, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10, underscoring their rosy financial outlook.On the other hand, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Less than a quarter of participants in this category provided a score between 7 and 10, which Boss pointed out creates a 30-point delta between these groups.Across income brackets, the average respondent rated their confidence at a 4.9 out of 10 rating.This income-based division was once again prevalent when consumers were asked about their confidence for covering monthly bills compared with six to 12 months ago.Nearly 6 of 10 high-income consumers said these bills were easier or becoming easier to cover. But just 37% and 30% of middle- and lower-income groups, respectively, said the same.Higher-income respondents were also more likely to say they were planning to increase spending on nonessential items over the next year than other brackets, according to JPMorgan's survey.JPMorgan isn't the only organization seeing a disparity between income classes when it comes to their economic outlook.The top one-third of earners have reported an average consumer sentiment rating that's around 25% higher than the lowest one-third over the last two years, according to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer survey. The Michigan survey's most recent results reflect interviews conducted July 29-Aug. 25 of a statistically representative sample of about 1,000 American households.",

Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has vowed to target only \"Democrat Agencies\" for permanent staffing cuts amid the government shutdown — but the administration's layoffs so far have affected programs and services that cut across party lines.The White House on Friday issued thousands of reduction-in-force notices, known as RIFs.Around 4,200 federal employees from at least eight departments and agencies were affected.The department sustaining the largest cuts was the Treasury Department, where nearly 1,450 staffers received RIF notices.The RIFs there included cutting the entire 83-person staff of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which invests in public-private partnerships to support lower-income communities, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.The CDFI has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Congress. In March, after Trump signed an executive order targeting the fund for cuts, a group of 23 senators wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to reaffirm \"the critical role it plays in the communities it serves.\"The letter noted that every dollar provided to CDFI \"generates at least eight more dollars from private-sector investment.\" The signatories included a group of Republican senators: Mike Crapo of Idaho, Montana's Tim Sheehy, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mississippi's Cindy Hyde-Smith, and Jim Justice of West Virginia.In late July, a longer list of Republican and Democratic senators urged White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought to swiftly give CDFI the funding that Congress appropriated for it.CDFI employees who received RIF notices on Friday were told that their service would end Dec. 13, the Journal reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesThe second-largest number of RIFs was issued to employees at the Health and Human Services Department, where more than 1,300 employees were reportedly affected.But the terminations of about 700 staffers at DHS, who work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were reportedly reversed the next day.But other fired employees, including those from the CDC's Washington field office, its Injury Center and its Division of Violence Prevention, will not be rehired, The New York Times reported.At the Education Department, 466 employees received RIFs.Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, wrote on social media on Friday that the hundreds of Education Department impacting special education services, school grants and more.\"Special education oversight. Grants to high-need schools. Protection of civil rights. Gone,\" she Pringle wrote. \"This administration is destroying our education system from the inside out.\"The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, where some of the cuts reportedly took place, is among the offices targeted in Project 2025, the right-wing manual for a major government overhaul.Some Republican senators have spoken out against the firings by the Trump administration.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Friday that she \"strongly oppose[s]\" Vought's attempt to permanently lay off furloughed workers, even as she blamed the shutdown on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, wrote in an X post Friday, \"There is no question this is poorly timed and yet another example of this administration's punitive actions toward the federal workforce.\"\"The termination of federal employees in a shutdown will further hurt hard-working Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service and jeopardize agency missions once we finally re-open the government,\" she wrote.The Trump administration, which blames Democrats for the shutdown that hit Day 14 on Tuesday, has argued that the firings are an unavoidable consequence of the federal funding lapse, though that has not been the case in prior shutdowns.At the same time, Trump has touted the prospect of mass cuts as an \"unprecedented opportunity\" to eliminate parts of the government that his Republican Party dislikes.His administration has already made clear through its Department of Government Efficiency that slashing the federal bureaucracy is a major priority, though that group's cuts have fallen short of its initial goals.The president's latest firing threats are explicitly partisan.On the second day of the shutdown, Trump said he was considering cutting \"Democrat Agencies\" on either a temporary or permanent basis.During a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, he said, \"We're only cutting Democrat programs.\"Democrats will \"get a little taste of their own medicine,\" he added.What that meant was unclear, as federal agencies and programs are not divided by party. Trump, at the meeting, described them as \"very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly.\"",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, D.C., on March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market are a sign that corporate lending standards grew too lax in the past decade-plus.Dimon, the longtime leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, was speaking about the recent collapse of auto parts firm First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor Holdings.\"We've had a credit bull market now for the better part of what, since 2010 or 2012? That's like 14 years,\" Dimon told CNBC on a call with reporters.\"These are early signs there might be some excess out there because of it,\" Dimon said. \"If we ever have a downturn, you're going to see quite a bit more credit issues.\"Dimon used more colorful language about the Tricolor failure later Tuesday.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" Dimon told analyst Mike Mayo during the bank's earnings conference call. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"The pair of bankruptcies have sparked concerns about the hidden risks involved when banks like JPMorgan, Jefferies and Fifth Third provide financing for private companies. In a quarter where JPMorgan handily topped expectations, thanks to booming activity in institutional trading, questions from reporters and analysts around credit losses took center stage.'Not our finest moment'While JPMorgan managed to dodge losses from First Brands, it did lend to Tricolor, causing $170 million in charge-offs in the quarter, said CFO Jeremy Barnum. Charge-offs happen when a bank recognizes it won't get repaid for loans it made.\"It is not our finest moment,\" Dimon said of the Tricolor episode. \"When something like that happens, you could assume that we scour every issue. ... You can never completely avoid these things, but the discipline is to look at it in cold light and go through every single little thing.\"The credit metrics watched by JPMorgan, including early stage delinquencies, are stable and actually better than expected, Barnum said. The company is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness that could flow into consumer credit, which hasn't happened yet, he said.The automotive company failures, which came amid pressure on international supply chains due in part to President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, have ensnared a constellation of banks.This month, the investment bank Jefferies said that funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies that bought First Brand inventory, while UBS said that its funds had about $500 million in exposure.Last month, regional bank Fifth Third disclosed that it expected up to $200 million in impairments from alleged fraudulent activity at a borrower; the client was Tricolor, Bloomberg reported.",

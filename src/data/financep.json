    "body": "I tried for over a decade to move to Spain. I went to study Spanish at 21, teach English at 26, and get my master's at 29, but always ended up back in the U.S. Back then, my options to stay long-term seemed so limited: get transferred through a company, marry a local, or have rare skills that qualified for a work visa. I didn't fit any of those boxes.I finally made my last move to Spain in 2015, at age 35, and I'm now a proud citizen. As the founder of She Hit Refresh — where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad — I often think about how much easier it is to relocate these days, thanks especially to the rise of digital nomad visas. Traditionally, you have to apply for visas from your home country, which can mean long processing times at consulates, strict requirements, lots of paperwork, and waiting in the U.S. until your visa is approved. But a few European countries now allow in-country applications. Keep in mind that aside from any local financial requirements for a visa or permit, other costs and considerations can include relocation specialists and lawyers who can help facilitate the process.Here are four countries in Europe that let you relocate first and handle the visa paperwork after you arrive.1. SpainSpain is one of the most popular destinations for Americans moving abroad. With its sunshine, warm culture, stunning scenery, and affordability for those with a U.S. income, it's easy to understand why.Spain launched its digital nomad visa in 2023 for freelancers, the self-employed, and remote employees. Apply from the U.S. and you'll be issued a one-year visa, but apply from Spain and you can get a three-year permit. Among the women I've worked with, processing times from Spain seem to be faster, too, sometimes just a few weeks.Before you go, gather key documents in the U.S., especially your FBI background check and apostille, or certificate of authentication, since they're more complicated to obtain once you're abroad. You'll also be asked to provide proof of remote work and income.Giovanna Gonzalez, 36, moved from Chicago to Valencia in April 2025. \"We booked a trip to Spain so we could apply from within the country,\" says Gonzalez, who tells me her experience was smooth, particularly with the help of an immigration attorney. \"We were approved in only two and a half weeks.\"Her advice? Work with a relocation specialist for housing, since finding a place quickly as an American without a local work contract can be challenging. 2. GreeceGreece is not only a popular vacation spot, but also an appealing destination for remote workers seeking sunshine on the Mediterranean coast, a slower pace, and lower cost of living. If I ever decide to relocate, I'd move to Greece.What most people don't realize is that Greece offers two separate options for remote workers: a digital nomad visa and a digital nomad residence permit. You have to apply for the digital nomad visa, which grants a one-year stay, from your home country. But you can apply for the digital nomad residence permit, which is valid for two years, once you're already in Greece. You'll need to show proof of monthly income of at least €3,500, health insurance, and a rental contract or property ownership.One of my podcast guests, Kathleen O'Donnell, 40, moved from Boston to Athens in 2022 and chose the residence permit. \"It was such a relief not to have to fly back to the U.S. to apply,\" she says. \"The process took time, but it was worth it for the flexibility.\" While you can apply on your own, O'Donnell says she hired a lawyer, which \"made the process much less stressful.\" 3. The NetherlandsThe Dutch-American Friendship Treaty (DAFT) allows freelancers and self-employed U.S. citizens to live and work in the Netherlands by registering a new or existing business and depositing €4,500 into a Dutch business bank account. You can apply and get the ball rolling on your DAFT visa after arriving. Remote employees don't qualify, meaning you can't be a W-2 employee. Stacy Holt, 44, moved to the Netherlands with her family in 2023. \"We sold everything, rented a house we'd only seen on video, and applied once we arrived,\" she says. \"It was definitely a stressful time, but within two months I had my residency card and my business registered.\" She tells me she moved for a better quality of life for her children, and to escape the stress of active shooter drills and future student debt for them. Her tip: Bring savings and patience, as housing can be difficult to secure without local rental history.4. AlbaniaAlbania may not be on your radar, but it's becoming a popular soft-landing spot for Americans. It's affordable, welcoming, and ideal if you want to \"test-drive\" life abroad without having to navigate complicated visa systems first.U.S. citizens can stay in Albania for up to a year, visa-free. Those who want to stay longer can apply for a residence permit in-country.Monica Miranda, 45, moved from Jersey City to Vlorë with her dog. She initially planned to stay a few months, but has now been there nearly two years. \"Getting my residency was easier than I expected,\" she says. \"I hired a lawyer, submitted my documents, and received a provisional visa within a week.\"Cepee Tabibian is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

    "body": "Elon Musk has called for the European Union to be abolished after the bloc fined his social media company X 120 million euros ($140 million) for a \"deceptive\" blue checkmark and lack of transparency of its advertising repository. The European Commission hit X with the ruling on Friday following a two-year investigation into the company under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. At the time, in a reply on X to a post from the Commission, Musk wrote, \"Bulls---.\"On Saturday he stepped up his criticism of the bloc. \"The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people,\" he said in a post on X.Musk's comments come as top U.S. government officials have also intensified their opposition to the decision.Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine an \"attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,\" in a post on X on Friday. \"Today's excessive €120M fine is the result of EU regulatory overreach targeting American innovation,\" said Andrew Puzder, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, on X on Saturday. \"The Trump Administration has been clear: we oppose censorship and will challenge burdensome regulations that target US companies abroad. We expect the EU to engage in fair, open, & reciprocal trade — & nothing less.\"Last week, the Commission said breaches included \"the deceptive design of its 'blue checkmark,' the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.\"\"With the DSA's first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users' rights and evading accountability,\" said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, at the time.X now has 60 days to inform the Commission of plans to address the issues with \"deceptive\" blue checkmarks. It has 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository and access to its public data for researchers.\"Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments,\" the Commission said in a statement.X.ai, the company which owns X, and the Commission have been approached for comment. oh ",

    "body": "When it comes to managing your finances, you may feel like you have to do the most: reap the most rewards from your credit cards, pay as little as you can in taxes, earn the highest returns on your investments and extract the most interest from your savings. If you feel this sort of pressure, you come by it honestly, says Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement at Morningstar and author of \"How to Retire.\" \"The [financial] industry has this optimizing mindset,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"If you're just learning and getting up to speed, you probably start to think that's the only way to do this stuff and that you're doing it wrong if you cut corners.\"To be clear, if you're the kind of person who enjoys drilling down into every tiny detail of your finances, and has time to do so that's fine, Benz says. But for the rest of us, taking a simplified approach can free up time and energy to do other things while keeping us on track to reach our financial goals, she says. In a recent article for Morningstar, Benz called this the \"good enough\" approach to managing finances. Though they may not be moves to \"maximize\" your finances, consider these four strategies, which she says will achieve similar results \"with much less time and hassle.\"Reverse budgetingMany major financial goals, such as saving for retirement and paying down debt, are predicated on your ability to consistently save a portion of your income, Benz says. \"If you are saving reasonably, it obviates the need to do a lot of other things,\" she says. \"Even if you make subpar decisions about investment selections, for example, if the savings rate is decent, it addresses a lot of things that might not be perfect in the plan.\"Put simply, consistently investing 20% of your income into a below average portfolio will likely get you a better outcome than putting 5% in and earning above-average returns. If you want to keep things really simple, try a strategy Benz uses known as reverse budgeting. Rather than trying to tinker with your spending to optimize your savings rate, pick a flat percentage of your income — Benz says 15% is a good target — and set that money to automatically come out of each paycheck to be put toward financial goals. The rest of the money is yours to spend as you see fit. Index investingTheoretically, someone picking the right investments at the right time can beat the stock market over the long term. In practice, though, it's really tough to do. Consider the managers of large-company U.S. stock funds, whose job it is to beat the S&P 500. Over the decade ended June 2025, just 8% of those mutual funds survived and beat the benchmark, according to Morningstar. That's why Benz recommends building a core portfolio of index funds, which come with low fees and merely track the performance of market indexes rather than trying to beat them. \"A lot of data point to the fact that index funds are really terrific choices, and they're hands off,\" she says. \"They can give you exposure to a lot of different parts of the stock and bond market with a single holding.\"\"To me, index funds are a great intersection of optimization and the 'good enough' portfolio.\"Simplifying financial relationshipsNo one wants to park their cash in an account that offers practically no interest. But you needn't move your money around in search of a few tenths of a percentage point either, Benz says. \"It drives me crazy — the idea of people running around trying to get the best cash instrument,\" she says. \"The best way to tip things in your favor is to go with a low-cost provider that will deliver a persistently competitive yield.\"In the context of a brokerage, that may mean comparing what you'll get on so-called \"sweep accounts\" — the places where your money sits within your brokerage account when it's not invested, she says. For high-yield savings accounts, it pays to remember that rates fluctuate, Benz says. It will probably be less of a headache to stick with a bank that you like and that pays a generous rate rather than ping-ponging between online banks offering the highest rate of the year. And if that bank or brokerage also offers credit cards with rewards you like, all the better, she says. When it comes time for you or someone else to get hands-on with your money, having more of it under one roof tends to make things more manageable.\"Reducing the number of financial relationships is such a good practice, which doesn't mean you want to be completely lazy,\" she says. \"But if you can try to skinny down the number of entities that you need to connect with, it's good all around.\"Using an advisorBenz thinks and writes about finances for a living. She published a book about retirement. Still, when it comes to managing money and planning her own retirement, Benz and her husband have enlisted the help of a financial planner. Doing so allows Benz to have an optimized financial plan — she's just letting someone else help with all the fine-tuning. \"She has it all calibrated, and that gives me a lot of peace of mind, knowing that someone else is doing that optimization and using pretty high-powered tools to do it, too,\" Benz says. It's not that Benz or you or anyone else couldn't figure this out on their own. But delegating some of the heavy lifting can free you up to focus on the things you really want to spend time and energy on. Benz favors fee-only planners, who may charge an hourly fee, bill you for specific services or charge something akin to a monthly or annual subscription rate. The key is, they don't get paid to sell you certain financial products, which can be a conflict of interest, Benz says. For Benz, working with a pro has been worth the cost. \"I felt a little glimmer of like, 'Oh, I should be doing this on my own,'\" she says. \"But ultimately, I realized that turning to someone who, importantly, has tools to come up with some really good answers ... that I don't necessarily have, I decided it was a good value proposition.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up today for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

David Dee Delgado | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe latest report on inflation, delayed by the government shutdown, showed consumer prices rising 3% year-over-year in September, including a 3.1% uptick in cost for food at home. As rising prices continue to affect consumers, President Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that Americans are struggling financially. \"The word 'affordability' is a con job by the Democrats,\" Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"The word 'affordability' is a Democrat scam.\"Lately, voters have expressed frustration with Trump's handling of the economy. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, according to a recent poll from NBC News.When asked about Trump's comments on Sunday, Bessent said that the administration was dealing with inflation issues leftover from the Biden administration and pointed to media coverage as a source of Americans' view of the economy.  \"The American people don't know how good they have it,\" he said. \"Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or over-regulation, that we are now seeing this affordability problem, and I think next year we're going to move on to prosperity.\"",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Jodie Foster, Billie Perkins, and Robert De Niro perform a scene in Taxi Driver directed by Martin Scorsese in 1976 in New York, New York.  Michael Ochs Archives | Moviepix | Getty ImagesIn the dwindling days of the California gold rush, the wife of a local miner faced a problem. Her husband's denim work pants kept ripping, so her tailor, Jacob Davis, had the idea to add copper rivets to key points of strain, like the pocket corners and the base of the button fly, to keep them from tearing. Davis' \"riveted pants\" soon became a roaring success and, unbeknownst to him at the time, marked the official birth of the blue jean, a garment that would transform fashion and come to represent the United States around the globe. \"It really has democratized American fashion and it also is the greatest export that we have sent to the world, because people identify jeans specifically with American Western culture,\" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \"It doesn't matter your economic or social class. It doesn't matter what your views are in terms of the political spectrum. Everybody wears denim.\" Jacob DavisCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.These days, denim is a major sales driver for retailers big and small, as the global denim market reached $101 billion this year, up 28% from 2020, according to data from market research company Euromonitor International. Major apparel companies from American Eagle to Levi Strauss are in a race to corner that market, leaning on A-list celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Beyonce to win over shoppers and drive sales in an unsteady economy.But if it weren't for Levi Strauss, founder of the eponymous blue jeans company, Davis' invention may not have gone far beyond the railroad town where it was created in the early 1870s. How Levi's created blue jeansSoon after Davis created his riveted pants, called \"waist overalls\" or \"overalls\" at the time, they began selling like \"hot cakes\" and he needed a business partner to secure a patent, said Tracey Panek, Levi's in-house historian. So he wrote to Strauss, a Bavarian-born immigrant who was running a successful wholesale business in San Francisco and had supplied Davis the denim he used to create his riveted pants. \"The secret of them Pents is the Rivits that I put in those Pockets and I found the demand so large that I cannot make them up fast enough,\" Davis wrote Strauss in a letter, according to PBS. Levi StraussCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Strauss, an \"astute\" businessman, recognized the opportunity and agreed to partner with Davis, said Panek. \"This would have been the first time that Levi was actually\" manufacturing his own products, said Panek. \"He was no longer just importing and selling other people's goods. He was manufacturing himself and selling to retailers.\"On May 20, 1873, the two men secured a patent for the riveted pants and eventually opened a factory on Fremont Street, close to the modern-day Salesforce tower in San Francisco's financial district. They promised to offer workers the most durable jeans on the market and soon, business was booming. Dude ranch duds and the American worker Through Strauss' connections as a wholesaler, the company's riveted overalls soon spread across the U.S., becoming the garment of choice for working men everywhere: miners, cowboys, farmers – any role that required durable clothing. Jeans were exclusively reserved for work settings at the time, but as emerging denim manufacturers vied for a similar customer base, they looked to expand their assortment to drive sales. \"Slowly and steadily into the 20th century, you start to see some of these manufacturers making variations,\" said Sonya Abrego, a New York City-based fashion historian. \"There was this one design called spring bottom pants that was kind of a more form fitted, a more dressed up, a slightly flared, maybe what the factory foreman would be wearing, right? As opposed to just the guy on the shop floor.\"In 1934, Levi created the first ever line of jeans for women. Around that time, denim started to become more popular in settings outside of work, primarily for activities like dude ranch vacations, camping and horseback riding. \"So they were kind of taking on a cowboy's garment or a worker's garment but wearing it in a … resort setting,\" said Abrego. Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co. Dude ranch vacations had become popular because there were finally highways connecting different parts of the country, and few were willing to venture to Europe during a war. Companies like Levi began releasing advertisements highlighting their denim as \"dude ranch duds\" and \"authentic western riding wear\" to capture shoppers looking for jeans to bring with them on vacation, according to archival advertisements from the time. These cultural moments helped to expand denim beyond workers, but jeans didn't become widespread casual attire until after World War II, when American fashion overall started to shift. The rise of the backyard BBQ By the time World War II ended, the mighty American consumer was beginning to emerge. For years, Americans had been forced to ration common goods like rubber, sugar and meat while simultaneously being encouraged to save their money by buying war bonds and socking away spare cash.When the country shifted from wartime to peacetime, Americans were ready to splurge and soon began spending big on new cars, appliances and clothes. \"With a little bit more money to spend, you start seeing a bigger push for leisure clothes and fun clothes and play clothes, clothes to wear to backyard barbecues,\" said Abrego. \"Clothes that we would consider today as just like casual style.\" Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Slowly and surely, it became more and more acceptable for both men and women to wear jeans outside of work settings. Then, denim manufacturers made a push to allow jeans in schools. \"They wanted to sell to as many people as they possibly could,\" said Abrego. \"The idea that jeans are good for school means that they're good for every day.\"By the time the 1960s hit, denim manufacturers had expanded their products and were selling a wide variety of colors, fits and styles. It became a symbol of the hippie movement and a mainstay on Hollywood sets. Soon, denim was everywhere, and the 1970s brought the iconic bell bottom pants and the first iteration of the \"designer jean\" — denim pants being produced by labels and brands whose designs had nothing to do with work wear or western wear, like Calvin Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt. Since then, denim has remained a constant in global fashion. While silhouettes, washes and fits have changed over time, jeans never really go out of style, which is what makes them so enduring, said Abrego. \"This is a design from 1873 … do we see anything else from 1873 on the street? It's kind of wild if you think about it that way,\" said Abrego. \"We can talk about all the details, all the changes in manufacturing and all the different fits and finishes but it's a recognizable thing, it's still a pair of jeans. For me as a historian, that continuity is so compelling because I can't really name anything else that has stayed the same to this degree.\" ",

    "body": "Yi He, co-founder of Binance, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on May 10, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBinance Holdings, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, named a new co-CEO Wednesday in a major shake-up of its leadership structure.Yi He, who co-founded Binance with former head Changpeng Zhao in 2017 and has children with the crypto mogul, will now split duties with acting CEO Richard Teng, who announced the news this week. The move represents the firm's most significant leadership change since Teng succeeded Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating U.S. money-laundering laws in 2023. Teng, who was appointed amid intense regulatory scrutiny of Binance and crypto more broadly, notably had a background in financial regulation and services, formerly holding a senior regulatory role at Singapore's central bank.\"[Yi He] has been there from the start, and she has been driving a lot of changes and driving the growth of Binance,\" Teng told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Wednesday shortly after the announcement.watch nowYi He's elevation to the co-CEO position represents the appointment of an insider with longstanding ties to Zhao, also known as CZ.The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned CZ, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange.The Trump administration has taken a friendlier stance toward the crypto industry, with several high-profile cases dropped in recent months. Queen behind the scenesYi He has maintained a relatively low public profile compared to CZ, with many details regarding her roles and activities at Binance unclear. Her social profiles list her most recent position as Chief Customer Service Officer at the crypto exchange.One of the last major public statements from the businesswoman was in defense of CZ during his 2024 trial, among 161 letters requesting leniency from the court.In her letter written in Chinese, Yi He identified herself as CZ's business partner and \"the mother of his three children.\"She claimed that she met CZ at a public blockchain event in 2014, three years before Binance was founded. She was then working at cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin and recruited CZ to join her.\"As CZ's life partner, I've known him for nearly ten years, so I understand a side of him that's often overlooked,\" she wrote in the 2024 letter defending him.Binance said in a statement Wednesday that Yi He has \"played a fundamental role in shaping Binance's vision and culture, guiding a strategy focused on users' needs and innovation.\"The company also included a public statement from Yi He, in which she emphasized her and Teng's \"complementary perspectives and shared vision.\" \"Together, we bring diverse perspectives and are confident in leading the future of the industry during this pivotal time, as we responsibly expand our global presence and drive sustainable innovation with our users always at the center,\" she said.watch nowFederal probes into Binance have also referenced her role in the company. In 2020, U.S. prosecutors reportedly sought records of communications involving Yi He and other executives related to anti-money laundering compliance and the creation of Binance's U.S. entity.Media reports have previously painted Yi He as a \"Crypto Queen\" wielding massive sway behind the scenes at Binance. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal in 2023,  Yi He was a former Chinese talk-show host before joining OKCoin, and she entered a relationship with CZ while working together in Shanghai. The report added that He would assume sweeping control over the crypto giant's marketing and investment divisions. Binance and Yi He did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 17, 2021. Andrew Kelly | ReutersA U.S. judge on Friday added new details to the remedies resulting from Google's antitrust case, finalizing the consequences the company faces after its defeat last year.In mid-2024, Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search, and in September of this year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser.Google was, however, ordered to loosen its hold on search data.Mehta on Friday issued additional details for his ruling. \"The age-old saying 'the devil is in the details' may not have been devised with the drafting of an antitrust remedies judgment in mind, but it sure does fit,\" Mehta wrote in one of the Friday filings. Mehta wrote that Google can't enter into any deal like the one it's had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Google pays billions of dollars per year to Apple to be the default search engine on the Safari browser on iPhones, Macs and iPads.The judge's ruling includes deals involving generative artificial intelligence products, and any \"application, software, service, feature, tool, functionality, or product\" that involve or use genAI or large language models.GenAI \"plays a significant role in these remedies,\" Mehta wrote.Mehta on Friday also included requirements on the makeup of a technical committee that will determine with whom Google must share its data. Committee \"members shall be experts in some combination of software engineering, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, economics, behavioral science, and data privacy and data security,\" the filing says.The judge went on to say that no committee member can have a conflict of interest, such as having worked for Google or any of its competitors in the six months prior to or one year after serving in the role.Mehta said the committee must \"have access to Google's source code and algorithms, subject to a confidentiality agreement,\" and reiterated the web index data it will require Google to share with certain competitors. Google has to share some of the raw search interaction data it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but not the actual algorithms. In September, Mehta said those data sets represent a \"small fraction\" of Google's overall traffic, but argued the company's models are trained on data that contributed to Google's edge over competitors.In August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. The antitrust trial started in September 2023.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously said it will appeal the judge's monopoly ruling.WATCH: Judge Issues final remedies in Google antitrust casewatch now",

    "body": "Logos of Netlfix and Warner Bros.ReutersThe Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery deal came together quickly — but its path to regulatory approval may not be so speedy. Netflix stunned the media industry on Friday when it announced its proposed $72 billion deal to acquire the iconic Warner Bros. film studio and streaming service HBO Max. The combination brings together two of the most popular streaming platforms in the business. Netflix reported 300 million global subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric. HBO Max had 128 million customers as of Sept. 30.  Netflix currently claims 46% of mobile app monthly active users in global streaming, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Combined with HBO Max, that share would rise to 56%, it found. \"This deal cements Netflix's position as the premier streaming service for original content,\" according to a research note from analysts at William Blair on Friday.The size of the deal makes it ripe for scrutiny, from both industry insiders and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration is viewing the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already called for an antitrust review. \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement. The merger would also give Netflix control over the famed Warner Bros. film studio, further consolidating the cinematic space and raising concerns that the number or typical windowing of popular releases could shrink. It's typical in the days and weeks following a deal announcement of this scale for interest groups, politicians and corporate competitors to call foul on antitrust grounds. The Department of Justice is most likely to review the deal, as it has other media mergers in the past, and it could take some time. DOJ reviews can take anywhere from months to more than a year. Netflix said Friday it expects the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, after Warner Bros. Discovery spins out its portfolio of cable networks into Discovery Global.

Grogan | CNBCNetflix executives on Friday said they were \"highly confident\" the deal would win regulatory approval.\"You know, this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call following the acquisition announcement. \"Our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but [we're] really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,\" Sarandos added. As part of the deal, Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal were to get blocked by the government. Netflix's bid won out over competing offers from Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and William Blair were at least minimally convinced Friday of the potential for the deal to go through. \"A merger of Warner Bros. Discovery and any of the three bidders would probably succeed, even if the DOJ were to sue to block a proposed combination,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Friday, citing insights from a Department of Justice veteran who the analysts said \"does not see any significant antitrust problems with any of the three scenarios.\" \"However ... we don't know all of the detailed facts that will be collected and analyzed by the DOJ, nor do we know who the judge hearing the case will be, and both of these factors can have an impact on the outcome,\" the Deutsche Bank analysts noted.  Paramount, for its part, has been fanning the flames. Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, in which it argued the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a separate letter, Paramount said a Netflix transaction would likely \"never close\" because of regulatory headwinds. Paramount was the only bidder looking to buy WBD's massive portfolio of pay-TV networks — and it's unlikely to walk away from the process quietly. Not so fastOracle co-founder, CTO and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison (C), U.S. President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (R), and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son (2nd-R), share a laugh as Ellison uses a stool to stand on as he speaks during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump announced an investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and took questions on a range of topics including his presidential pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, the war in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies and other topics.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesWall Street expected President Donald Trump's second term to usher in a windfall of dealmaking. However, economic uncertainty has slowed the process for some companies, and regulatory holdups have played a bigger role than anticipated.  \"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said in Friday's statement. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\" Paramount's merger with Skydance was left in limbo for more than a year before it finally won federal approval in July. The Federal Communications Commission (which is unlikely to review the Netflix-WBD tie-up since it doesn't involve a broadcaster) signed off on the $8 billion merger shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount had also ended its diversity, equity and inclusion policies earlier in the year after the FCC said it would investigate the company over its DEI programs. In September, the newly combined Paramount Skydance, run by David Ellison, set its sights on Warner Bros. Discovery. The company is now considering whether to take a hostile bid straight to WBD shareholders and try to unseat Netflix as the would-be buyer, CNBC reported Friday. Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is known to be close with Trump. The argument for whether to clear Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. would likely come down to questions around streaming — first, on pricing for consumers, and second, on how to define Netflix's audience. The pricing of streaming subscriptions has risen across the board in recent years. In 2022 Netflix instituted a cheaper, ad-supported model after years of resistance in an effort to beckon more customers. The following year, Disney followed with its own more-affordable plan. Netflix is used to upending the legacy media industry. The company ended its DVD rentals business in 2023 and went all in on streaming. It's since found massive scale and has taken over the zeitgeist with original series like \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and \"Bridgerton.\" Its maverick approach to media and its broadening foothold in the industry may be its saving grace in the eyes of regulators. \"My expectation on the regulatory side is Netflix is going to advocate and argue with their advisors for a very expansive definition of what their market is ... so that would include broadcast, cable, subscription and ad-supported streaming,\" said said Jeff Goldstein, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners, and co-lead of the U.S. Media group. \"And really, really, really importantly, that would include YouTube,\" he said.YouTube has come to dominate the industry when it comes to viewership. Nielsen once again reported in October than YouTube had the largest share of TV usage, with Netflix in sixth place and Warner Bros. Discovery in seventh place. Traditional media companies with linear networks — Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox and Paramount — filled the spots in between. Critics of the deal will define Netflix's reach more narrowly to try to demonstrate outsized dominance, said Goldstein. \"I believe that streaming is not a category. Television viewership is a category ... you know, eyeballs might be a category,\" media industry titan John Malone told CNBC in November when asked about antitrust questions surrounding the WBD sale process. \"But if you're going to broaden the category to that, you got to take in YouTube and Facebook and the social networks, TikTok,\" he said. \"I mean, that's really the question, is streaming a category? ... Are studios a category ... and is that going to get looked at hard? These regulatory things are a little bit difficult to predict.\" — CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, speaking to CNBC at the Future Investment Institute 2025 summit in Riyadh on Oct. 28th, 2025.CNBCThe Middle East is fast emerging as one of the world's most powerful AI hubs, Bridgewater Associates' founder Ray Dalio said Monday, comparing the region's rise to Silicon Valley's pull for all things tech. Speaking to CNBC, Dalio said the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors have combined vast pools of capital with an influx of global talent, creating a magnet for investment managers and AI innovators alike.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have this year launched multibillion-dollar initiatives to build cloud, data centers and other AI infrastructure, underpinned by sovereign-wealth capital and global tech partnerships. A $10 billion agreement between Google Cloud and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund announced this year aims to create a \"global AI hub\" in the country, as part of a broader push to host data-centers and AI workloads locally.Earlier this year, technology giants OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco combined forces to build a major Stargate artificial intelligence campus in the United Arab Emirates.When asked if he thinks that the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar can be leaders in the AI race, Dalio said, \"What they've done is to create talented people. So this [region] is kind of becoming a Silicon Valley of capitalists ... So now people are coming in … money is coming in, talent is coming in.\"watch nowDalio, who has been visiting Abu Dhabi for more than three decades, said the Gulf's transformation is the result of deliberate statecraft and long-term planning. He described the UAE as \"a paradise in a world that's troubled,\" citing its leadership, stability, quality of life and ambition to build a globally competitive financial ecosystem.\"There's a buzz here, the way there's a buzz in San Francisco, places like that, about AI or technology. It's very similar to that,\" Dalio said.'Precarious' next two yearsThe Bridgewater founder warned that the global economy was headed toward an uncertain future in the near term due to a confluence of multiple forces, reiterating his concerns about markets being in bubble.  \"The next year or two in the future is going to be more precarious,\" he said, pointing to the convergence of what he calls the three dominant cycles: debt, U.S. political conflict and geopolitics.The global debt overhang is already forcing stress into pockets of the market.\"We're seeing cracks in the markets in a number of ways, private equity, venture capital, debt that's being refinanced, and all of those. So we are in a bubble, I believe, by almost all of those measures,\" Dalio said, highlighting similarities with the 2000 bubble but not the one in 1929.He also expects U.S. politics to become more disruptive heading into 2026. \"As we go into the 2026 elections … you will see a lot more conflict in different ways,\" Dalio said, adding that elevated interest rates and concentrated market leadership compound the vulnerability.\"Every country … cannot continue to accumulate the debt they have, yet politically they can't raise taxes and they can't cut benefits. So they're stuck.\" That fiscal bind feeds into a broader rise in domestic polarization: \"We now have populism of the left and populism of the right … which means irreconcilable differences.\"Dalio reiterated his view that the AI rally is in bubble territory, but advised investors not to rush for exits just because valuations are stretched.Concerns about an AI bubble have been swirling in recent months, with notable voices such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggesting that the AI market was in a bubble. Investor Michael Burry, who called the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, has forecast the artificial intelligence market bubble could collapse in the next two years. \"All the bubbles took place in times of great technological change,\" Dalio said. \"You don't want to get out of it just because of the bubble. You want to look for the pricking of the bubble.\"The catalyst for that \"pricking,\" he said, usually comes from a tightening of money or a forced need to sell wealth to meet obligations. He also warned of stress in venture capital, private equity and commercial real estate, sectors where cheap debt is now rolling over at higher rates. ",

    "body": "Shoppers may be feeling sticker shock with the cost of beef at the grocery store.Prices in the beef and veal category are up 14.7%, while overall food is up 3.1% from September 2024 to September 2025 — the latest publicly available consumer price index data due to the government shutdown in October.But expenses for America's farmers are soaring too. Input costs for ranchers are up more than 50% over the past five years, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.\"It's hard as a beef producer to necessarily say that beef prices are too high. I mean, if people are paying $6 for a latte at Starbucks, but then they're paying $6 for a pound of beef, they're able to feed a family for a family of three with that pound of beef,\" said Taylon Lienemann, co-owner of Linetics Ranch in Princeton, Nebraksa.A major driver of the rising price of beef prices stems from a record low cattle supply. The start of 2025 saw the smallest national herd since 1951.The cattle cycle is the natural expansion and contraction of the U.S. cattle herd — which is tied to supply and demand. It typically occurs every eight to 12 years. When producers can get higher prices for their cattle, they will likely retain more females, called heifers, for breeding. When the cattle supply increases, prices eventually go down and the herds contract again. \"It's the big question right now for our producers. You know, they have a 50/50 decision to make. Do we sell these cattle off into the supply system or do we hold them back? And I think when the money is on the table, there's an incentive to go ahead and sell those to the food supply system, especially when demand is so high from the consumer,\" said Adam Wegner, director of marketing for the Nebraska Beef Council.Severe drought can also impact the decision for a rancher to retain cattle for breeding. \"When you're in a drought, you're producing minimal feed and or hay or alfalfa,\" Lienemann said. \"The amount of cattle that are out there are still out there, and they're still needing that feed.\" During times of drought, ranchers will often supplement grass feed with grain. Grain prices have come down significantly since 2022, but it can still be an unexpected cost for producers.\"What we're experiencing now is a sort of a mashup of drought, high demand and low heifer retention, sort of making up this herd size problem that we have today in America,\" said Omaha Steaks CEO Nate Rempe. \"We have got to build the herd, period.\"The direct-to-consumer meat company said it hasn't raised prices in over three years but it's now feeling the pinch.\"The cost of beef has increased so much that it's really starting to hit our bottom line,\" Rempe said. \"We're looking internally all the time. How can we find efficiencies? How can we invest in our business to drive more volume for less cost? But there is some breaking point, right? There is some point at which the raw material that we need is at a price point, that we're going to have to start passing some of that on.\"Despite smaller herd numbers, beef production has increased overall because the U.S. is producing bigger cattle. Incremental supply, mainly for ground beef, also comes from beef imports, which have been increasing steadily over the past decade. Now a rapidly evolving tariffs situation in Brazil and parasitic cattle infections in Mexico are further driving up prices for consumers. Still, experts say that the domestic herd is most critical for long term relief.\"In the short run, if we actually begin retaining heifers to put into the breeding herd, that actually is going to reduce total domestic beef production because we have fewer animals going to the feedlot. So that's going to actually keep prices supported that much more in the short run. But within that three-year period that we're talking about, we'll start seeing that increased production feed into the system, which should start to [soften] beef prices and cattle prices alike,\" said Andrew Griffith, an agricultural and resource economics professor at the University of Tennessee.Watch the video to see an exclusive look at Omaha Steaks' processing facilities and to learn more about how high inflation is affecting the beef industry.",

    "body": "Mikael Sjoberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSweden's Volvo Cars on Thursday posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, prompting shares to rally by around 40% and putting the stock on track for its best-ever trading day.Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, posted operating income for the July-September period of 6.4 billion Swedish kronor ($680.4 million), well above analysts' expectations and up from 5.8 billion kronor a year earlier.Its margin on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) came in at 7.4% for the third quarter, compared to 6.2% in the same period last year.Volvo Cars said the result was largely driven by its ongoing 18 billion kronor cost-saving program, as well as certain one-off items.The Stockholm-listed stock price jumped as much 41% on Thursday morning, before paring gains to trade up 33.1%. It still reflects the firm's biggest intraday gain since it started trading four years ago.\"In a tough market we delivered a solid third-quarter result and our cost and cash actions are delivering,\" Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson said in a statement.\"We returned to a slight sales growth in September and we are now ramping up sales of our BEV cars. We are fully on track towards the very important January launch of the EX60 in the largest and most popular electric segment,\" he added.Looking ahead, Volvo Cars said it expects to see more positive effects from its cost-cutting drive in the final three months of the year.It noted, however, that the short-term outlook appears to be increasingly challenging, citing persistent macroeconomic challenges, including price competition and the effects of U.S. import tariffs.Job cutsVolvo Cars announced 3,000 job cuts and withdrew its financial guidance earlier in the year, citing tariff pressure and robust competition in the electric vehicle market.The automotive sector is regarded as acutely vulnerable to tariffs, given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.The U.S. and EU agreed to a framework trade deal in July, with U.S. Donald Trump's administration imposing a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods. The agreement marked a significant reduction from Trump's threat to impose charges of 30% and almost halved the tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.Industry groups, which tentatively welcomed the trade deal, expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariff reality.",

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba on Thursday announced pricing for its upcoming artificial intelligence glasses and launched a new chatbot powered by its latest AI models.The Chinese technology giant said the Quark AI Glasses will go on pre-sale on Oct. 24 on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Tmall. The pre-sale price will start at 4,699 Chinese yuan ($659.4) but after applying various discounts, will cost 3,999 yuan.Alibaba will begin shipping the product from December.The Hangzhou-headquartered firm also unveiled AI Chat Assistant, a new chatbot mode within its existing Quark app.The latest moves are part of Alibaba's aggressive AI push this year which has seen the company release updated models and a drive to reinvigorate sales at its cloud computing business through which it sells much of this technology to businesses.But the glasses and chatbot product highlight an increasing area of focus for Alibaba — AI that is aimed at consumers.Alibaba's shares closed nearly 1.7% higher in Hong Kong and its U.S.-listed stock also rose in premarket trade.Alibaba AI glassesAlibaba first announced the Quark AI Glasses in July. It's the first product of its kind from the Chinese giant and the eyewear is powered by the company's Qwen large language model and its Quark AI assistant.The glasses support functions such as hands-free calling, music streaming and real-time language translation.Many tech companies see wearables, specifically glasses, as the next frontier in computing, alongside the smartphone. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's answer to Meta's smart glasses that were designed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The Chinese tech giant will also now compete with Chinese consumer electronics player Xiaomi who this year released its own AI glasses.New AI assistantQuark is Alibaba's main consumer-facing AI app. Alibaba on Thursday unveiled a product called AI Chat Assistant, which is a new AI chatbot powered by its latest Qwen3 models.The new mode allows users to switch to a chatbot style interface and have conversations via text or voice. Alibaba said the new feature allows \"AI search and conversation\" in one interface. The idea is that users can do everything they need in one application.Alibaba said some of the functions include photo editing, \"photo-based problem solving\" and AI writing.The product is Alibaba's answer to the growing number of chatbot products out there from OpenAI's ChatGPT to DeepSeek.",

    "body": "Prospective home buyers leave a property for sale during an Open House in a neighborhood in Clarksburg, Maryland.Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesThe majority of would-be homebuyers expect mortgage rates to continue their recent decline, and it's one of the main reasons why they're waiting to make a purchase, according to the findings of a new CNBC Housing Market Survey.Rates have been creeping down over the last few months and are hovering around the lowest level in a year, with the average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan now sitting at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. But nearly three-quarters of real estate agents surveyed by CNBC said most of their buyers think rates will come down further.\"My biggest challenge is when buyers hear predictions of future rate decreases, which in turn have buyers sit on the sidelines and wait to see how low they will go instead of getting out there and buying now,\" said Maureen States, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh.The CNBC Housing Market Survey is a national inquiry of real estate agents selected randomly across the United States. Responses were collected between Sept. 22 and Sept. 30. This quarter, 54 agents shared what they're seeing in their market.Most agents said they consider the current conditions to favor buyers over sellers, but they still listed affordability as the No. 1 reason why buyers are delaying their purchases.Despite optimism that mortgage rates will continue to fall, agents said rates are still buyers' top concern. That was followed by uncertainty in the economy and then just overall affordability.That sentiment appears at least somewhat divorced from reality, however: 44% of agents reported prices are decreasing in their areas, and just 20% said they are rising.\"Sellers are still pricing for a seller's market, and buyers are willing to wait for prices and rates to drop. It is a bit of a standoff, and folks are only moving if they absolutely must,\" said Katie Kosnar, an agent in North Carolina serving Raleigh and Durham. \"Right-sizing used to be a driving factor, but most sellers I've encountered will be paying a higher mortgage for a smaller house and just aren't willing to make that move.\"As a result, buyers are using interest rate buydowns or turning to adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower interest rates, in order to offset price pressures.Roughly 40% of survey respondents said their buyers are borrowing money from family or friends in order to afford a home. Buyers are also compromising on home size, location or features in order to bring the price down, agents said.The vast majority of agents in CNBC's survey said they expect home sales to either improve slightly or stay about the same in the next quarter, and about 17% expected sales to drop. Of course this varies by location, with some of the markets that heated up the most during the pandemic seeing the steepest declines, and other more affordable markets seeing bigger gains.As for sellers, agents reported the biggest concern among that group is how long it will take to find a buyer. Some are concerned they're pricing their home too low, and sellers, too, are watching mortgage rates closely, agents said.About 89% of agents who took CNBC's survey reported having at least one seller reduce their asking price, and nearly a third said more than half their sellers dropped prices.Roughly 40% of agents said they had at least one seller delist their home, hoping to get a better price later.Home prices continued to rise on an annual basis through August, according to several other national indexes, but the price gains are shrinking. Prices are gaining most in the Northeast and Midwest and weakening most in the South and West.The supply of homes for sale in September was higher than it was a year ago, as were new listings after a particularly slow August, according to Zillow.New listings usually drop from August to September, and while that was true this year — with new listings down 2% month to month — it was a smaller decline than the average 9% monthly tumble seen over the past seven years, also according to Zillow.Inventory has made solid gains over the past year, but it is still historically tight, especially for more affordable properties.\"For buyers, low inventory and mortgage rates, from an affordability standpoint, are still a challenge,\" said Holly David, an agent in Richmond, Virginia. \"For sellers who are locked in to a 3% [mortgage] rate, even though they may have a housing want or need, they may not be willing or able to make a move.\"",

MetOp-SG is a family of meteorological satellites placed in sun-synchronous polar orbit which will make it possible to refine short-term forecasts. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesAirbus, Leonardo and Thales announced Thursday that they will combine their satellite and space activities to form a \"leading European player in space,\" as the region looks for a homegrown rival to Elon Musk's Starlink.The companies — each a heavyweight in the aerospace and defense sector in their own right — said the joint venture would develop and build, \"a comprehensive portfolio of complementary technologies and end-to-end solutions, from space infrastructure to services.\" The development of space launchers will be excluded from the new company's operations.The combined entity is expected to generate mid-triple-digit million euros in annual synergies on operating income within five years of closing, and it's set to employ 25,000 people across Europe.European defense stocks jumped on Thursday, with the regional Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index adding 0.9%. Leonardo shares were last seen trading 1.8% higher, while Thales gained 0.6% and Airbus was up by 0.2%.Airbus will be the majority owner of the new joint venture with a 35% stake, and will contribute its Space Systems and Space Digital businesses from its defense and space division. Leonardo and Thales will each hold a 32.5% stake in the new company.Leonardo's contribution will be its entire Space division, including its shares in Rome-based spaceflight services firm Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space, an existing joint venture with Thales. Thales will also add its stake in Thales Alenia Space to the new company, as well as its Thales SESO operation. The firms said the new space entity would be \"a unified, integrated and resilient European space player, with the critical mass to compete globally and grow on the export markets.\"\"This new company also intends to serve as the trusted partner for developing and implementing national sovereign space programs,\" they added.Touting the joint venture as \"a pivotal milestone for Europe's space industry,\" the chief executies of the firms said in a joint statement that it would help \"build a stronger and more competitive European presence in an increasingly dynamic global space market.\" They stressed that the move would allow Europe to retain control over its domestic space operations, as regional governments look to pour cash into their aerospace and defense capabilities. Starlink rivalEurope has been looking for an alternative to Starlink, the satellite broadband service owned by Musk's space exploration firm SpaceX that currently dominates the sector and has a vast presence across Europe.Starlink has played a critical role in Ukraine's war effort since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, but issues have reportedly arisen in the past with communication blackouts. Earlier this year, it was rumored that Eutelsat — the French firm that merged with Britain's OneWeb in 2023 — was in the running to replace Starlink in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has backed the concept of a European satellite champion, arguing in a speech over the summer that \"space has in some way become a gauge of international power.\" Meanwhile, Italian lawmakers warned against involving SpaceX in an update to the country's satellite program back in July.Speculation that Airbus, Leonardo and Thales would join forces on satellite functions has been building for some time. Back in April, Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani told CNBC he was hopeful the alliance would come to fruition in the coming months.He said at the time that the joint venture would not be specifically designed to challenge Starlink, but to provide a European alternative.watch nowEutelsat has long been vying to become the regional rival to Musk's company. However, its fleet of satellites is vastly overshadowed by Starlink's, with the latter launching its 10,000th satellite into orbit earlier this week. David Barker, investment manager of GAM's European equity team, told CNBC that the joint venture announced on Thursday was \"the first tangible evidence of Europe addressing its waning technological sovereignty since the start of the second Trump administration.\"\"Prior to [this], Europe competed against itself, through three subscale companies against the growing dominance of SpaceX,\" he said. \"We see this as a positive step towards re-establishing Europe's space industry as a global force and also a positive signal that the European project may be able to re-assert itself where it has failed in other areas such as cross-border banking, capital markets and defence consolidation.\" Meanwhile, Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC the move was \"another step in the right direction for Europe.\" \"For Leonardo, Thales, and Airbus, space is a relatively small part of their businesses, but joining forces certainly provides more clout to compete in the global market,\" he said. \"We remain bullish on the aerospace and defense sector in general, with four-star ratings on both Thales and Leonardo.\" — CNBC's Ryan Browne and Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThere was a stony silence from Moscow a day after the U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin and slapped punishing sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies.Just days after a \"very productive\" phone call between the two leaders — in which they agreed to meet in Hungary and after which the U.S. president appeared to take Russia's side regarding a possible peace deal with Ukraine — Trump changed tack on Wednesday, voicing his frustration with Moscow.\"We canceled the meeting with President Putin. It just, it didn't feel right to meet. It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we'll do it in the future,\" Trump said Wednesday.\"Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere,\" Trump added, flanked by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, with whom he had discussed peace proposals for Ukraine.watch nowAsked why he had chosen to impose a package of sanctions on oil majors Lukoil and Rosneft at that moment, Trump said, \"I just felt it was time, we've waited a long time.\"Stony silenceTrump's comments on Putin were notably widely absent from pro-Kremlin state media outlets such as TASS, Radio Sputnik and RIA Novosti's news coverage on Thursday, with barely a mention of the criticism or canceled meeting.Just a day before, Russian state media — essentially, the mouthpiece of the Kremlin — had been bullish that planned talks between Putin and Trump that were due to be held in Hungary, but which had been postponed by the White House, would go ahead.The Kremlin and various senior Russian officials had blamed \"fake news\" for undermining the Trump-Putin summit but the White House appeared to have put the talks on hold after Russia reiterated its position that it did not support an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attends a meeting of Russia's President Vladimir Putin with Laos' President Thongloun Sisoulith in Moscow, Russia, May 9, 2024. Alexei Maishev | Via ReutersPutin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov has not yet publicly commented on the canceled meeting, the sanctions, or the prospect of Trump-Putin talks being held in future. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for comment.Read moreRussia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday that that the ministry was ready to \"continue contacts\" with the U.S. State Department but said its goals in Ukraine \"remain unchanged,\" in comments translated by NBC News. The latest sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil were counterproductive, she added, to finding a peaceful solution to the war.Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a well-known anti-West hawk, slammed Trump's cancellation of the Budapest summit, commenting on Telegram Thursday that the \"U.S. is our adversary and their talkative 'peacekeeper' [Trump] has now fully embarked on the warpath against Russia.\"\"Now Trump has fully aligned himself with an insane Europe,\" Medvedev posted, in comments translated by Google.Sanctions pressureThe sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft, and dozens of subsidiaries, are aimed at pressuring Moscow, which has funded its three and a half year war in Ukraine using revenues derived from global oil sales, to agree to a ceasefire, the U.S. Treasury said.The Treasury Department said the new sanctions will harm the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue to fund its war against Ukraine.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his department \"is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump's effort to end yet another war,\" Bessent said. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"watch nowThe EU on Thursday also launched a fresh rounds of sanctions against Russia. The package of measures, which member states approved on Wednesday evening, includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.Kaja Kallas, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and vice president of the European Commission, told CNBC Thursday that the new sanctions are \"a good signal of strength that the U.S. is putting sanctions on big Russian oil companies. It's really depriving Russia of the means to fund this war. It's necessary to end this war.\"",

Some of those benefit cuts and new eligibility requirements are already going into effect as states implement Trump's legislation.Those changes will cause 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their SNAP benefits, the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan provider of policy research, estimated in a July report.Local food banks left to bridge the gapRecent and upcoming cuts to SNAP, along with the current funding freeze as the shutdown stretches into the third week, put additional strain on local food banks and nonprofits, which are often needed to fill the gap in communities when federal assistance falls short.Many of these organizations rely on federal grant aid to run their operations, and some of that funding is now delayed. Due to a lapse in appropriations, nonprofits are also facing a potential shortfall, said Sarah Saadian, senior vice president of public policy and campaigns at the National Council of Nonprofits, an industry association.\"The longer it continues, the harder it is for nonprofits to continue services in their communities,\" Saadian said of the partisan battle in Washington. \"Most nonprofits are small and have limited budgets that they stretch and try to make work; they are not sitting on a large cushion of resources.\"'We may not be able to meet that emergency need'At Michigan Community Action, which is an anti-poverty organization that supports food, transportation, child care and housing assistance agencies throughout the state, operations are in a \"wait-and-see mode,\" according to Brian McGrain, the executive director.\"If [SNAP] benefits go unfunded, where are people going to turn?

    "body": "Elon Musk listens as reporters ask U.S. President Donald Trump and South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa questions during a press availability in the Oval Office at the White House on May 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThere was a lot missing from Tesla's third-quarter earnings call.CEO Elon Musk said nothing about demand for the company's electric vehicles after a key federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of the Cybertruck or the impact of tariffs on auto parts. Investors got no sign for how the fourth quarter is shaping up. That all helps explain why the stock sank almost 4% in extended trading. Rather than focus on sales, margins and earnings (which missed estimates), Musk took a familiar path, making bold promises and laying out his futuristic vision for the business. It starts with robotaxis, and Musk's view that skeptical investors and much of the public fail to see what's coming. \"People just don't don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off — where it's honestly — it's going to be like a shock wave,\" Musk said in his opening remarks. \"We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we're making a couple million a year.\"Musk has for years promised that Tesla's EVs will be able to do work for their owners, making them money while they sleep by ferrying passengers or goods around without a driver. But while Alphabet's Waymo is aggressively entering new markets with its commercial robotaxi service, and Baidu's Apollo Go is taking off in China and elsewhere, Tesla is still limited to a few pilot projects. During Tesla's prior earnings call in July, Musk predicted that the company would have autonomous ride hailing available to \"probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.\"  The company still doesn't produce or sell cars that are safe to use without a human ready to steer or brake at all times.watch nowOn Wednesday, Musk said Tesla would have its robotaxi service operating without human drivers in Austin by the end of the year and that it would be running in eight to 10 cities by the close of 2025, at least with drivers on board.As for its current fleet of cars, finance chief Vaibhav Taneja said on the call that the customer base for FSD Supervised, Tesla's partially automated driving system, \"is still small,\" with 12% of users paying for the system. Taneja didn't offer an average sale price that subscribers are paying after Tesla ran a number of promotions to drive uptake. Tesla said in its investor deck that FSD revenue was lower than in the year-ago period, when the figure was $326 million. That means FSD accounted for less than 2% of total revenue in the latest quarter. After robotaxis, Musk turned to humanoid robots, repeating his prediction that Optimus has the \"potential to be the biggest product of all time.\"Optimus is Tesla's bipedal humanoid robot that's in development but not yet commercially deployed. Musk has previously said the robots will be so sophisticated that they can serve as factory workers or babysitters. Now he's raising the bar. \"Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,\" Musk said on Wednesday. He said that with Optimus and self driving, \"you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.\"Musk said Tesla will likely demo a new version of Optimus, which he called V3, in the first quarter of 2026.At the end of the call, Musk kept the focus on robots but combined it with another topic of importance: his pay package. A Tesla Optimus robot scoops popcorn and waves at attendees during the opening of the Tesla Diner and drive-in restaurant and supercharger on Santa Monica Blvd. in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles on July 21, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesIn September, Tesla introduced a new pay plan that could be worth $1 trillion and increase Musk's stake in the company by 12%. Tesla will hold its annual shareholder meeting in early November, when the plan will be up for a vote.\"If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?\" Musk said on the call. \"I don't feel comfortable building that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.\"He also took aim at proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after the firms recommended shareholders vote against approving his new pay plan.Musk said ISS and Glass Lewis \"have no freaking clue,\" and described them as \"corporate terrorists.\"Representatives from the two firms didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In the meantime, Tesla still relies on auto sales for the vast majority of its revenue. And while revenue increased 12% in the third quarter from a year earlier, that followed two straight year-over-year declines, and analysts expect a drop of about 2% in the fourth quarter. Absent from the call was any discussion of what Tesla may be doing in the near term to restore consumer enthusiasm.Tesla's brand ranking declined to the 25th spot on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list out earlier this month, from 12th in 2024. The report said that \"Tesla was once the main disruptive force in the automotive industry,\" but Musk's political activities along with a lack of new products \"has led to concerns about Tesla's ability to sustain high margins.\"Through Tesla's online forum, investors submitted questions about new products in the pipeline. But on the call, investor relations lead Travis Axelrod twice refused to read them. \"This is not the appropriate venue to cover that,\" he said.

    "body": "A \"for rent\" sign is posted in front of a home on Dec. 12, 2023 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesRents for single-family residential homes rose just 1.4% in August compared with the year before, according to analytics and data firm Cotality, down from a 2.3% annual gain in July. That's also much less than the 3% average gain seen last year and is the smallest increase in 15 years.Rent growth weakened across all price points, continuing a trend that has persisted in the second half of this year. Rents had been strengthening in the first half of this year.There were, however, strong variations regionally. Chicago saw the highest annual rent growth at 4.7% in August, followed by Los Angeles at 2.8%, Philadelphia at 2.7% and Washington, D.C., at 2.6%.Dallas saw a 0.6% decline in rent growth, the lowest in the nation. Dallas recently had a surge of new multifamily apartments come onto the market, which is keeping supply higher than demand, Cotality said.\"Atlanta, Philadelphia and Los Angeles continue to show stronger rent growth, with Los Angeles now only slightly above its pre-wildfire level from January,\" said Molly Boesel, senior principal economist at Cotality. \"Los Angeles ranks second among the top 10 metros for rent growth, suggesting that local conditions such as recovery efforts, limited housing supply, and regional economic factors can still influence rental trends even as national price growth moderates.\"High-end properties are faring the best, with August annual rent growth at 1.6%. Low-end rent prices increased 1.1% from a year ago, but both are well off last year's gains.Multifamily apartment rents have also been cooling. That is largely due to a construction boom in the sector that delivered a record number of units in the past few years, with more coming on this year.Apartment rent prices nationally were down 0.8% in September compared with the year before, according to a separate report from Apartment List. That drop, however, was slightly less than the annual dip in August. Rents had been going more and more negative for five straight months.The national multifamily vacancy rate was 7.1% in September, a record high for that index, according to Apartment List.\"We're past the peak of a multifamily construction surge, but a healthy supply of new units are still hitting the market, and vacancies are still trending up,\" according to Apartment List researchers.The national median monthly rent in September was $1,394, down $11 from September 2024, the report said. As rents continue to fall, albeit slowly, rents are now below their most recent peak in August 2022, or $48 a month cheaper.\"But that cooldown came following a period of record-setting rent growth, and the typical rent price remains 22% higher than its January 2021 level,\" researchers wrote.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesSocial media giant Reddit has launched a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Perplexity, alleging that it illegally scraped user posts to train its AI model, marking the latest data-rights clash between content owners and the AI industry. The complaint filed in New York federal court on Wednesday also named three defendants, which Reddit says helped Perplexity collect its data: Lithuanian data scraper Oxylabs, \"former Russian botnet\" AWMProxy, and Texas startup SerpApi.Reddit alleged that the three smaller entities were able to extract its copyrighted content \"by masking their identities, hiding their locations and disguising their web scrapers as regular people.\"Perplexity, which runs an AI-powered search engine, denied the allegations and accused Reddit of \"extortion\" and opposition to an open internet, while SerpApi told CNBC it \"strongly disagrees\" with Reddit's claims and intends to defend itself in court. The case represents one of many filed by content owners accusing AI firms of using copyrighted material without permission to train their large language models. Reddit, in particular, has been on the front lines of that battle, having launched a similar ongoing lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic in June. CNBC was unable to reach Oxylabs and AWMProxy.In a statement shared with CNBC, Ben Lee, Chief Legal Officer at Reddit, said that AI companies are\" locked in an arms race for quality human content\" and that pressure has fueled an \"industrial-scale 'data laundering' economy.\"watch nowScrapers bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material. Reddit is a prime target because it's one of the largest and most dynamic collections of human conversation ever created.Reddit — which hosts over 100,000 interest-based \"subreddit\" communities — said in its lawsuit that its user posts had become the most commonly cited source for AI-generated answers on Perplexity. It added that it sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist letter, after which it increased the volume of citations to Reddit \"forty-fold.\"AI researchers have previously noted that Reddit's large volume of moderated conversations can help make AI chatbots produce more natural-sounding responses.In the age of artificial intelligence, Reddit has worked to leverage its massive data pool, permitting access to it only through AI-related licensing agreements. The social media company has signed such agreements with OpenAI and Alphabet's Google. In a response to the lawsuit, Perplexity, in a post on the Reddit platform, argued that it does not train AI models on content but merely summarizes and cites public Reddit discussions. Therefore, it said it is \"impossible\" to sign a license agreement.\"A year ago, after explaining this, Reddit insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data. Bowing to strong arm tactics just isn't how we do business,\" the statement read, going on to describe the suit as a \"show of force in Reddit's training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI.\" \"Perplexity believes this is a sad example of what happens when public data becomes a big part of a public company's business model,\" Perplexity added, noting that data licensing has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Reddit. In February, Reddit's COO Jen Wong told the trade publication Adweek that AI licensing deals with Google and OpenAI made up nearly 10% of Reddit's revenue. ",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit (FAIR) and other product-related positions will be impacted.However, the cuts did not impact employees within TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into the social media company this summer, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Those employees, overseen by Wang, were spared by the layoffs, underscoring Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on his expensive hires versus the legacy employees, the people said.Within Meta, the AI unit was considered to be bloated, with teams like FAIR and more product-oriented groups often vying for computing resources, the people said. When the company's new hires joined the company to create Superintelligence Labs, it inherited the oversized Meta AI unit, they said. The layoffs are an attempt by Meta to continue trim the department and further cement Wang's role in steering the company's AI strategy.Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.Following the cuts, Meta's Superintelligence Labs' workforce now sits at just under 3,000, the people said.Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a \"non-working notice period.\"\"During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,\" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. \"You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.\"The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, \"minus your notice period.\"CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.Axios was first to report the layoffs.— CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

    "body": "MADRID, SPAIN - SEPTEMBER 15: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addresses the media as he leaves a meeting, Sept. 15, 2025, in Madrid, Spain. Gustavo Valiente | Europa Press | Getty Images  The U.S. is weighing curbs on software-related exports to China, in response to Beijing's sweeping rare-earth export controls, as both sides prepare for a critical round of negotiations.Answering a question from CNBC's Eamon Javers on whether Washington was considering limiting exports of products using American software to China, as reported by Reuters, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed, saying that \"everything is on the table.\"\"If these export controls, whether it's software, engines or other things happen, it will likely be in coordination with our G-7 allies,\" Bessent added.President Donald Trump earlier this month said that the U.S. would impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" to China beginning next month by barring global shipments of goods containing U.S. software to the country. Trump had also announced an extra 100% tariff on Chinese exports in retaliation to curbs Beijing announced on the exports of its rare earth minerals.Bessent's statement comes ahead of his highly anticipated talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia later this week, which would set the stage for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea at the month's end.A spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce said in a statement Thursday that a delegation led by He will hold trade talks with their U.S. counterparts in Malaysia from Friday to Monday. \"The two sides will discuss key issues in the bilateral relations, based on the important consensus reached during the phone calls between the two heads of state this year,\" the statement in Mandarin read, translated by CNBC.watch now\"How the meeting [between Bessent and He] goes will have a significant impact on the chance and vibe of Xi-Trump meeting later in Korea,\" said Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI. While the top leaders' meeting may not deliver a major deal, it will help keep the minister-level negotiations on track and ultimately help solve specific issues, Wang added.Trump said Wednesday that he has a \"long\" meeting scheduled with Xi during the upcoming trip to South Korea, where he expected to reach a deal with the Chinese leader over soybean purchases and limits on nuclear weapons.\"We can work out a lot of our questions and our doubts and our tremendous assets together. So we look forward to that. I think something will work out. We have a very good relationship, but that'll be a big one,\" the president told reporters at the White House.Beijing has held back from confirming its plans for the meeting, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying at a regular briefing Tuesday that \"the U.S. and Chinese top leaders have maintained close communication, which is crucialHigh-stakes meetingTensions between Washington and Beijing have intensified in recent weeks, as both sides have issued new threats ahead of negotiations.In September, the U.S. Commerce Department unveiled a dramatic expansion of its export controls as part of its efforts to block Beijing from accessing cutting-edge chips.China has hit back with sweeping new curbs on rare-earth exports, placed more U.S. companies on a blacklist and launched an antitrust investigation into tech major Qualcomm.watch nowBeijing has also started charging U.S.-linked ships with fees for docking at Chinese ports, matching the U.S. move to impose fees on Chinese vessels arriving at U.S. ports.The \"breakdown of trade truces\" has become the new norm, said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, stressing the continued tit-for-tats underscored by a \"deep and persistent mistrust\" between the two nations.Beijing's push for relaxed export controls, lower tariffs and investment opportunities in the U.S. will be \"hard asks\" for Washington, said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute, while naming critical minerals supplies, fentanyl curbs and soybean purchases among Trump's priorities.Both sides are working against the deadline of Nov. 10 when higher reciprocal tariffs are set to resume, if they fail to agree on another extension, though Trump has set Nov. 1 as the deadline for 100% additional tariffs announced earlier this month.\"A lot to be worked out in a short period of time,\" Cutler said, expecting both sides to extend the deadline for another 90 days, or longer, to keep talks going without implementing the threatened measures.",

    "body": "Landon Loomis, vice president for Latin America & Caribbean at Boeing, speaks during a panel at the Bloomberg New Economy Gateway event in Panama City, Panama, on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. Tarina Rodriguez | Bloomberg | Getty Images Boeing named Landon Loomis, a Mandarin speaker and former White House advisor, as the new president of Boeing China, counting on his deep experiences in Beijing to steady the planemaker's position as U.S.-China tensions flare anew.The appointment, effective immediately, will see Loomis take over the role from his predecessor Alvin Liu, who was appointed to the role in August 2023.Loomis will run the day-to-day operations, strategy and senior government relations from Beijing, while continuing his current role as Boeing vice president of global policy.Before joining Boeing in 2019, Loomis spent five years as trade attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing where he oversaw the aviation portfolio and other programs, and later served as special advisor to former Vice President Mike Pence for over two years.\"There was no one better qualified for the Boeing China president's role than Landon Loomis,\" said Brendan Nelson, president of Boeing Global. \"Landon will continue to build upon our longstanding partnership and presence in China, drawing upon his deep industry and government experience and his own experience living and working in China.\"Prior to the appointment, Loomis served as president of Boeing Latin America and Caribbean and CEO of Boeing Brazil.Bargaining chipBoeing, a top U.S. exporter whose output of airplanes helped ease the U.S. trade deficit, has been caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China tensions and increasingly been treated as a bargaining chip in the long-running negotiations.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to choke off exports of Boeing plane parts as part of Washington's response to Beijing's tightened export curbs on rare earth minerals. When asked what items the U.S. could impose export controls on, Trump said: \"We have many things, including a big thing is airplane. They (China) have a lot of Boeing planes, and they need parts, and lots of things like that.\"In April, Beijing ordered its airlines to stop accepting new Boeing jets, sending back several jets earmarked for China back to the U.S. as part of the escalating confrontation with Washington. Beijing later quietly backpedaled in May as tensions eased briefly after both sides held their first round of talks in Geneva.Still, the aviation giant highlighted the uncertainties with the U.S.-China trade relations, including tariffs, export restrictions, as major risks to growth outlook. While deliveries to China have resumed, the company still faces the risks of lower deliveries or losing market share, the company said in June.As of June, Boeing had around 20 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced for customers in China which it planned to deliver this year.Bloomberg reported in August that Boeing was working toward finalizing a deal to sell as many as 500 jets to Chinese carriers — in what would be a major boost to the struggling planemaker which has seen orders slump in the world's second largest aviation market.Its rival Airbus on Wednesday announced it had opened a second assembly line in China, boosting its manufacturing capacity in the country and further upping the pressure on Boeing.- This story has been updated to correct the spelling of former Vice President Mike Pence.",

    "body": "An exterior view of the new JPMorgan Chase global headquarters building at 270 Park Avenue on Nov. 13, 2025 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024 when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, while the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintechs, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals were in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintechs for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he was worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" said Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

    "body": "Move over, coastal hubs: many of the best cities for Gen Z workers are located in the Midwest, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the top cities for Gen Z workers based on their scores in three key areas: employment, affordability and social life.Checkr calculated the employment score for each city based on its unemployment rate and labor force participation. To determine the affordability score, Checkr analyzed income to rent ratio, real personal income and the percentage of renters paying over 30% of their income.Each city's social life score is based on the Gen Z portion of the population in each city and the number of Gen Z members per entertainment establishment. Employment and affordability were weighted 40% each, while social life was weighted 20%.For Gen Z workers making entry-level salaries, \"it's going to be really difficult to survive and save money\" in major cities like Los Angeles and New York, according to Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr.Cities like Des Moines and Milwaukee may not have the same hustle and bustle, but they can offer lower costs of living and slower-paced lifestyles, Radbil says.The cities on this list provide both \"career momentum and lifestyle alignment in a single package,\" he says.Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for Gen Z workers.1. Madison, WisconsinMadison secured the top spot because of its proximity to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Radbil says.Students from all over the country are drawn to the school due to its academics, sports and social scene, Radbil says, and the city is a \"great starting point\" for grads to begin their careers.Beyond the university, Madison's proximity to Chicago and Milwaukee means that young people have access to \"very strong job opportunities\" in the area, according to Radbil.2. Minneapolis, MinnesotaOne of the larger cities in the Midwest, Minneapolis offers city comforts paired with a low cost of living.Minneapolis is also attractive to Gen Z workers because of its progressive values and welcoming social scene, Radbil says.3. Des Moines, IowaDes Moines has a thriving insurance industry, which provides ample job opportunities for Gen Z workers interested in that sector, Radbil says.Beyond that, the city offers affordability and a low cost of living, which provide \"a growing appeal to younger workers who want a meaningful start without that big city burnout.\"4. Omaha, NebraskaOmaha \"blends that Midwestern charm with pretty real economic momentum,\" according to Radbil.Gen Z workers can find ample jobs in the insurance, finance and education sectors, and a \"small startup ecosystem\" is also developing, Radbil says.Notably, legendary investor Warren Buffett calls Omaha home, he says.5. Nashville, TennesseeNashville is best known for its music roots, but the city also boasts a growing tech presence and a \"very cool entrepreneurial scene,\" Radbil says.Radbil compares Nashville to Austin \"without the insane rent prices yet,\" although the city's popularity is likely to drive up the cost of living, he says.Still, Gen Z workers are attracted to Nashville because \"the lifestyle there is so appealing,\" he says.6. St. Louis, MissouriAffordability is the main draw for St. Louis, Radbil says.Its low cost of living is attractive to young workers looking to settle down and purchase a home, according to Radbil.\"St. Louis gives you that opportunity to maybe get a start for a lower price, and really feel like you have some roots and you own something, which is important to people,\" he says.7. Austin, TexasAustin is a \"Gen Z magnet,\" according to Radbil.The city's atmosphere is \"very young and culturally rich, and there's so much to do outside,\" he says.Economically, Austin is also flourishing: its business-friendly environment has attracted large companies like Tesla and Apple, and the startup scene is booming, according to Radbil.As a result, \"the job market is incredible,\" Radbil says.8. Milwaukee, WisconsinMilwaukee is an attractive option for Gen Z workers due to its strong job market and reasonable cost of living, according to Radbil.While young professionals may only be able to afford tiny studios in major cities, in Milwaukee, \"you could get an apartment overlooking Lake Michigan,\" Radbil says.The city also offers a robust social scene and \"amazing\" summer weather, he says.9. Salt Lake City, UtahSalt Lake City is \"one of the most balanced cities for Gen Z workers\" due to its growing economy, access to nature and relative affordability, Radbil says.It's also an \"awesome location\" for young professionals who work remotely, he says: \"All those mountain towns and cities out west have really grown in popularity.\"10. Boston, MassachusettsBoston is home to \"world-class\" universities like Harvard University and MIT, which attract thousands of young professionals across industries.\"The universities are so important to creating jobs for people,\" he says. \"Whether it's science or biotech or just working at the university, I think that the job opportunities there are awesome.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Swiss flag is pictured at the Harbor in Geneva, Switzerland, March 13, 2024. Denis Balibouse | ReutersThe U.S. and Switzerland have reached a trade deal, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Friday.Duties will be reduced to 15%, the Swiss government said in a post on X, adding that further details will be announced at 4 p.m. local time.As part of the deal, Swiss companies have pledged to invest some $200 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2028, which includes funding for education and training, according to a statement by the Swiss government.\"We've essentially reached a deal with Switzerland,\" Greer told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.\"They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.\"Greer added that more details on the deal, which he said had \"really been in the works since April,\" would later be published on the White House website.watch nowThe deal means the country-specific tariff imposed on Swiss goods will match the rate levied on those brought to the U.S. from the European Union.\"Like all the president's deals, we keep a tariff,\" Greer said on Friday. \"We retain a tariff on these countries because we have to get the trade deficit under control. But because Switzerland, for example, has agreed to manage its trade surplus with the United States, in terms of making sure that things where they have a trade surplus with us — pharmaceuticals, gold, et cetera — their companies are going to build here, so it's going to eliminate some of the sources of that surplus.\"He pointed to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, which pledged earlier this year to invest $50 billion in the U.S.\"The announcement of the reduction in additional US tariffs on Swiss imports will serve to stabilise bilateral trade relations,\" the Swiss government said in its Friday statement. \"Although overall tariffs remain higher than before the additional tariffs were introduced in April, the agreed reduction in additional tariffs is expected to have a positive impact on the Swiss economy.\"Back in July, President Donald Trump announced Switzerland would be hit with a 39% tariff rate, which took hold when a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials during last-ditch talks in Washington.That meant Switzerland was subject to one of the highest tariff rates imposed on an individual country by the Trump administration.Switzerland, an export-driven economy, has already taken a hit from the tariffs. Last month, Swiss officials cut the country's economic growth forecast for 2026, citing the \"heavy burden\" of the U.S. duties on its industries.Its biggest exports include watches, pharmaceuticals and precious metals, but the country is also renowned for its luxury goods, chocolate and skincare products.The Swiss franc added 0.4% against the greenback following the trade deal announcements on Friday.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday said that he is asking the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.Emails released by a House committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\" Trump also faces a looming vote in the House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.\"Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures, I will be asking A.G.

Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote Friday in a Truth Social post.\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote.\"Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.'

    "body": "watch nowWalmart CEO Doug McMillon is retiring early next year, after overseeing the top U.S. retailer's transformation into an e-commerce behemoth, the company said Friday in a filing.The longtime CEO will be succeeded by John Furner, the Walmart U.S. CEO, on Feb. 1, according to the filing.McMillon, who stepped into the top role at Walmart in February 2014, will officially retire as of Jan. 31. He will continue to serve as an executive officer of the company and be employed by Walmart as an advisor through Jan. 31, 2027.Furner, 51, has been the CEO of Walmart's U.S. business since 2019. In that role, he oversees more than 4,600 stores and the largest sector of the company. He started at the company in 1993 as an hourly associate.Walmart Inc. President and CEO Doug McMillon delivers a keynote address during CES 2024 at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas on January 9, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Ethan Miller | Getty ImagesThe announcement of the CEO transition comes only six days before the retailer is set to report quarterly earnings. Walmart shares were up 13% this year as of Thursday's close, as the company grows its digital business and wins over more high-income shoppers. For more than a decade, McMillon, 59, has led the retail giant and overseen the company's growth as an e-commerce leader. He also oversaw the business during a tumultuous time marked by the Covid pandemic, supply chain disruptions, high inflation and tariff changes.During his time leading the company, Walmart's shares have risen nearly 300%. The company's stock fell more than 2% in premarket trading Friday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWalmart stock since Feb. 1, 2014.McMillon and Furner have had similar paths to the top role at Walmart. Both began as hourly associates and moved up the ranks at the retail giant, serving in merchandising and operations roles. Both also served as chief executives of its warehouse club, Sam's Club.In a statement, Walmart chairman Greg Penner described Furner as \"the right leader to guide Walmart into the next chapter of our growth and transformation.\"\"After starting as an hourly associate and being with us for over 30 years in a variety of leadership roles across all three of our operating segments, John understands every dimension of our business – from the sales floor to global strategy,\" Penner added.\"Serving as Walmart's CEO has been a great honor and I'm thankful to our Board and the Walton family for the opportunity,\" McMillon said in a statement. \"I've worked with John for more than 20 years. ... He's uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation.\"Along with Walmart, big-box competitor Target is also poised to get a new leader in early 2026. Target announced last month that Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer and former chief financial officer, will succeed longtime Target CEO Brian Cornell on Feb. 1.This is breaking news.

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStubHub shares plunged 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported quarterly results for the first time since its initial public offering in September.Here's how the ticket vendor did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Loss per share: $4.27Revenue: $468.1 million vs. $452 million expectedDuring a conference call with investors, StubHub CEO and founder Eric Baker said the company wouldn't provide guidance for the current quarter.Baker said that the company takes \"a long term approach,\" adding that the timing of when tickets go on sale can vary, making it hard to predict consumer demand. StubHub plans to offer outlook for 2026 when it reports fourth-quarter results, he said.\"The demand for live events is phenomenal,\" Baker said. \"We don't see anything with consumer demand that's any different.\"Revenue increased 8% in its third quarter from $433.8 million a year earlier, the company said.StubHub reported a net loss of $1.33 billion, or a loss of $4.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or a loss of 15 cents per share, during the same period last year. StubHub said this reflects a one-time stock-based compensation charge of $1.4 billion stemming from its IPO.Gross merchandise sales, which represent the total dollar value paid by ticket buyers, rose 11% year over year to $2.43 billion.The company faced tough comparisons from a year earlier, when results were boosted by Taylor Swift's massively popular Eras Tour. Excluding that impact, StubHub said GMS grew 24% year over year.Founded in 2000, StubHub primarily generates revenue from connecting buyers with ticket resellers. It competes with Vivid Seats, which was taken public via a special purpose acquisition company in 2021; SeatGeek; and Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment.\"We are building a truly differentiated consumer product that improves the experience for fans while unlocking better economics for venues, teams, and artists through open distribution,\" Baker said in a statement. \"We're early in that journey, but our progress so far gives us great confidence in our strategy and the long-term value we're creating.\"StubHub raised $800 million in its long-awaited IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, which came after it delayed its debut twice. The most recent stall came in April after President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs roiled markets. The company restarted the process to go public in August when it filed an updated prospectus.On Thursday, the company's stock closed at $18.82. Shares are now down roughly 20% from the IPO price of $23.50.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on Oct. 31, 2025 in West Palm Beach, Florida.Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump is once again on the warpath against a major global media company, having threatened the BBC with a $1 billion lawsuit this week.The British public broadcaster found itself in hot water after airing a documentary in which Trump's Jan. 6 speech in 2021 was edited to make it look like he was explicitly encouraging his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol.As concerns over the documentary came to light, the BBC went into crisis mode, with both its director general and head of news resigning. Meanwhile, BBC Chair Samir Shah said the corporation was assessing the \"very serious allegations\" and apologized for an \"error of judgment\" over the edit.The BBC on Thursday apologized to Trump and agreed not to show the documentary again on any of its platforms. It reportedly rejected the U.S. president's call for compensation, however. Trump told Fox News this week that he has an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC.Here's what's going on and why it matters:How did we get here?In October 2024, the BBC aired a Panorama documentary called \"Trump: A Second Chance?\" in which it showed Trump addressing supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.In the Panorama program, Trump was shown saying, \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol ... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\" The edit combined two separate parts of his speech, although this was not flagged to viewers, making it look like he had explicitly instructed his supporters to riot in a single statement.That was not the case as Trump had said, \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,\" and only much later (in fact, around 54 minutes later) he said, \"and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Save America Rally\" near the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021.Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe speech became infamous as Trump supporters descended on the Capitol after the address, with skirmishes breaking out with police and a number of protesters entering the building. At the time, Trump urged those involved in the riots to \"go home now.\"The documentary doesn't appear to have caused a fuss at the time, but the editing process came to light when a memo written by ex-BBC adviser Michael Prescott was leaked to the press in which he criticized editorial standards at the BBC.The Panorama documentary in the spotlight was not made by the BBC, but by a third-party production company called October Films. Nonetheless, questions have been asked as to why it was reviewed and approved for broadcasting. The documentary is no longer available to view on the BBC iPlayer.What does Trump want?A crisis engulfed the BBC as news of the rogue edit emerged. Director General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness resigned. But that has not stopped the scandal snowballing with questions centering on the BBC's editorial standards amid allegations of institutional bias.On Tuesday, the BBC issued a statement in which it said, \"we accept our edit created the impression we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from two different points in the speech.\"\"Consequently, this gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. The BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement,\" it said, adding that \"there was no intention to mislead.\"A view of the BBC building as BBC Director-General Tim Davie and Head of News Deborah Turness have resigned after revelations that a documentary about U.S. President Donald Trump contained edited and misleading footage related to the 2021 Capitol riot, in London, United States on November 10, 2025. Rasid Necati Aslim | Anadolu | Getty ImagesTrump's legal team wrote to the BBC, demanding that it immediately retract what it said were \"false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements\" about the president in the documentary. The letter, which was published in full by Sky News, said the airing of the program had \"caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.\"It warned that Trump would sue for $1 billion in damages unless the corporation issued a \"full and fair retraction,\" apologized and compensated the president \"for the harm caused.\"The letter, signed by Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito, said the BBC has until 5 p.m. EST on Friday Nov. 14 to comply with the president's demands, otherwise, \"he will be left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights ... including by filing legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"\"The BBC is on notice,\" the letter concluded.In his first comments on the matter, the president told Fox News on Monday that his Jan. 6 speech had been \"butchered\" in the Panorama edit. When asked if he would go ahead with the lawsuit, Trump said, \"Well, I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that.\"What happens next?The BBC on Thursday issued a statement on its Corrections and Clarifications page, saying it had reviewed the Panorama documentary following criticism over how Trump's Jan. 6, 2021 speech was edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the BBC said.\"The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement,\" it added.A BBC spokesperson has said that while the corporation \"sincerely regrets\" the manner in which the documentary clip was edited, they \"strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"BBC News has reported that, \"if Trump sues in Florida, he would also need to establish the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.\" There appears to be no evidence so far to suggest it has been shown in the U.S.The British government has defended the corporation, however, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy wanting to distinguish between \"editorial failings\" and the BBC's critics who, she said, were \" launching a sustained attack on the institution itself.\"U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also commented on the furore on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he believed in a \"strong and independent BBC.\"It's not the first time Trump has pursued legal action against big media organisations, with lawsuits launched against the Wall Street Journal, CNN, CBS, ABC and New York Times in recent years, with some cases settled and others dismissed.— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

Its Vision Fund had accumulated roughly $4 billion worth of Nvidia shares in 2017 before selling out entirely in early 2019.Even so, SoftBank continues to have business ties to Nvidia.

As part of the split, Curry will maintain sole ownership of Curry Brand and is free to find another retail partner. Under Armour will release the Curry 13, the final Curry Brand shoe with Under Armour, in February.\"For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround,\" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. \"And for Stephen, it's the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We'll always be grateful for what he's brought to the UA team.\" \"What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it's only growing stronger,\" Curry said in a statement. \"I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.\" Under Armour's split with Curry was announced alongside an expansion of the company's restructuring plan. The company now expects it to cost $255 million, $95 million more than it previously said, including the separation of the Curry brand, additional contract terminations, impairment charges and severance costs. Under Armour's basketball business, including the Curry brand, is expected to bring in between $100 million and $120 million in revenue during the current fiscal year, which will end early next year, the company said in a news release. The separation is not expected to have a \"significant effect\" on Under Armour's financial results or profitability, it said.watch nowUnder Armour's breakup with Curry, one of the most successful and widely known basketball players of his generation, comes at a difficult point for the brand. The company has seen a revolving door of top leadership, sales have fallen for eight straight quarters and Plank is trying to position it as a premium brand at a time when consumers aren't spending as much on new clothes and shoes.Plus, the competitive landscape has changed dramatically since Plank founded the business in 1996. These days, even industry leaders like Nike are struggling to hold on to their market share in the face of upstarts like On and Hoka, which have been wooing top athletes and winning over a new generation of customers. To reignite sales, Plank has worked to fix Under Armour's assortment and redefine the brand more clearly in a strategy he said will begin to show up on shelves, stores and social channels this fall and winter season.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Under Armour shares have fallen about 40% this year. Nike and Adidas, which both have partnerships with an array of top NBA players, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Curry's partnership with Under Armour had long been a focal point for the brand and presumably would have been a major part of its turnaround strategy. Given the state of Under Armour's business, the abrupt breakup raises questions about what may have driven the split.Over the last nine years, Curry was mentioned on just about every quarterly earnings call Under Armour held, according to a review of transcripts dating back to 2016. But in its most recent one last week, there was no reference to Curry or the partnership.The sneakers worn by Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors before the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves during Round 2 Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2025 at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Jesse D. Garrabrant | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesDuring the call, Plank talked about the brand's opportunities in football and intimated it could do more in basketball.\"You can take a category like basketball that's roughly $100 million globally for us all in. And we think to ourself it's incredible for a $5 billion company, that can't exploit that in a bigger, better way,\" said Plank. \"So being underscaled relative to the potential we have and the opportunity that we have to grow it. So we're approaching that positioning as to where do we have the right to play, the right to win, and we think we can just do a little better.\"Curry Brandwatch nowIn 2013, Curry shocked the sneaker world by signing with Under Armour over Nike. At the time, Under Armour was a much smaller brand, but Curry was drawn to the company's \"underdog mentality.\"Curry told CNBC Sport earlier this year he hoped Curry Brand will outlive his playing career and become a brand other athletes embrace — similar to Nike's Jordan Brand. The four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP is 37 and nearing the end of his basketball playing career, and he has started to focus more on golf and other business activities outside of basketball.Curry Brand launched in 2020. In 2023, the brand signed a new long-term extension and made Curry the president, housed under Under Armour's banner. As part of that deal, the 11-time NBA All-Star was given 8.8 million Under Armour common shares, valued at $75 million at the time, in addition to other awards and incentives.Under Armour will continue to develop new UA Basketball products after parting with Curry, according to a statement.\"This move lets two strong teams do what they do best,\" Plank said in the statement. \"Under Armour is focused on product innovation and performance for athletes at every level. Curry Brand gets the independence to determine its own future. That's good for Stephen and good for UA.\" — CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for the data center came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after the earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader selloff reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips, and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and the founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

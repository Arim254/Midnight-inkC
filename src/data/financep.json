    "body": "Despite a brief pandemic-induced recession, higher inflation and rising borrowing costs since 2020, the wealthy have gotten considerably wealthier.The threshold to be in the top 10% of U.S. households by net worth grew from about $1.3 million to roughly $1.8 million over the last five years, largely due to rising stock and home values, according to a recent Visa analysis of 2024 U.S. Census Bureau survey data. That figure reflects the value of what households own — homes, vehicles, savings, retirement accounts, investments and other assets — minus any debts.In absolute terms, households already in the top 10% by net worth saw their wealth grow more than any other cohort over the last five years, according to the Federal Reserve's distribution of wealth data.The income needed to be in the top 10% also increased, climbing from about $170,000 to roughly $210,000 over the same period, Visa's analysis shows. For comparison, the U.S. median income is $83,730 as of 2024, per U.S Census Bureau data.Visa defines \"affluent\" households as those who either earn at least $210,000 or have a net worth of about $1.8 million, a level that places them above 90% of U.S. households.About 12.2 million U.S. households qualify under that definition, and Gen X makes up 57% of them, compared with 12% for boomers, the analysis shows. Millennials and Gen Z together account for the remaining 31%.It may not be surprising that Gen X leads the affluent group, given they're in their peak earning years, while many boomers are retired.Most wealth gains came from rising home and stock valuesThe last five years were unusually good for households that already owned a home or had money in the market. Even through the Covid-19 pandemic and a spike in inflation, the job market stayed strong and consumers kept spending, which kept the economy on solid footing.Home prices surged beginning in 2020 on tight supply and cheaper mortgage rates, which stayed near historic lows until the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in 2022, the first increase since December 2018.Major stock indexes also rebounded quickly from the early 2020 crash and went on to hit new highs, buoyed by a massive federal stimulus and a fast economic recovery, as measured by gross domestic product.Those trends pushed wealth up much faster than incomes. Paychecks rose, but at roughly half the pace. Between 2020 and 2024, the threshold for the top 10% of net worth grew about 40%, compared with about 23% for income, according to Visa's analysis.Broader indicators tell the same story: the U.S. median home price rose about 25% over the last five years, per U.S. Census data, and the S&P 500 gained roughly 109%.

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Despite slower job growth compared to the last decade, the U.S. economy is expected to add 5.2 million jobs from 2024 to 2034, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest employment projection report. Total employment is projected to grow by 3.1%.Based on the report, the top-growing industry sectors for 2034 are health care and social assistance and professional, scientific and technical services, which have projected growth rates of 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively.Within those sectors, the fastest-growing occupational groups are health-care support, which includes roles like nurse practitioner and physician assistant, and computer and mathematical roles, such as data scientist and information security analyst. These groups are expected to grow by 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively.One of the main reasons that the health-care industry is expected to grow so rapidly is because the American population is aging, according to Emily Krutsch, branch chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\"That's really what's driving that trend: the older population tends to need more of this type of care and services,\" she says.Computer and mathematical roles will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology, according to Krutsch.\"We are expecting a boost in employment growth for occupations that would be involved in developing and testing and implementing these types of tools,\" Krutsch says.Relatedly, information security analyst roles are projected to grow significantly due to the \"larger need to protect data and develop systems and tools to secure it,\" she says.Krutsch emphasizes that the growth rate for each job isn't the only important data point to consider.For example, wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are the two fastest-growing jobs, but both occupations combined will add under 20,000 jobs by 2034. \"Just because we're talking about fast growth doesn't necessarily translate to lots of jobs, because it could just be a very, very small occupation,\" Krutsch says.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, these are the fastest-growing occupations for 2034, as well as the expected increase in jobs by 2034 and the current median salary for each role.1.

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:1. Self-regulate before you reconnectBefore your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.2. Lead with connection, not correctionBefore asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: \"You matter more than the morning rush.\"This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.3. Create pockets of calm amid chaosIntegrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.4. Find moments for laughterEven in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.5. Check in emotionally, not just logisticallyBefore diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: \"How's your heart this morning?\" or \"What's one thing you're looking forward to today?\"These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.6. Make physical touch non-negotiableA morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.7. Create a screen-free sanctuaryMake mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 8. Honor the power of slownessChildren live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child’s natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.9. Create a bridge before goodbyeInstead of rushing out with a quick \"Let's go,\" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.Then add a \"connection bridge,\" or something to look forward to later: \"I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,\" or \"Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.\"Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Holiday Emotional Safety Bundle.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNovember has been quite volatile, with the high valuations of artificial intelligence stocks and expectations of an interest rate cut in December impacting investor sentiment. Those seeking stable income in this uncertain backdrop can consider strengthening their portfolios by adding some dividend paying stocks.Given the vast universe of dividend stocks, selecting the attractive ones could be challenging. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help in decision-making, as their selection is based on in-depth analysis and thorough research.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MPLXMPLX (MPLX) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and offers fuel distribution services. The company announced a third-quarter distribution of $1.0765 per common unit, reflecting a 12.5% year-over-year growth. At an annualized distribution of $4.31 per unit, MPLX offers a yield of 8.03%.In a recent research report, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on MPLX stock and raised the price target to $60 from $58. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MPLX stock with a price target of $59.\"We continue to view MPLX as one of the most compelling income plays among large-cap MLPs with an attractive current yield of ~8% and plans to grow further,\" said Scotto.The top-rated analyst expects MPLX to deliver higher EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) growth from 2025 to 2026 compared to the prior year, driven by the scale-up of key projects like the Secretariat processing plant, the Titan sour gas treatment expansion, and the BANGL pipeline system.Additionally, Scotto is optimistic about MPLX delivering mid-single-digit EBITDA growth beyond 2026, driven by contributions from the Eiger pipeline and its Gulf Coast fractionation and export facilities, along with potential mergers and acquisitions. While Scotto slightly reduced her 2025 and 2026 adjusted EBITDA estimates following the Q3 results, she continues to expect MPLX to achieve its mid-single-digit annual growth target.Meanwhile, Scotto maintained her distribution per unit estimates and expects a 12.5% rise in 2026, followed by an incremental 12.5% hike in 2027, in line with the company's distribution growth target.Scotto ranks No. 333 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.4%.ConocoPhillipsAnother dividend-paying energy stock in this week's list is ConocoPhillips (COP). Earlier this month, the oil and gas exploration and production company announced an 8% hike in its fourth-quarter dividend to $0.84 per share, payable on December 1. COP stock offers a dividend yield of 3.65%. Following meetings with ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on COP stock with a price target of $115. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on ConocoPhillips stock and has assigned an \"outperform\" rating with a price target of $96.\"In terms of resource depth and diversity, we see COP as better positioned than any company in our coverage universe,\" said Todd. He highlighted that ConocoPhillips has an industry-leading 22 years of drilling inventory, along with strong growth from LNG and U.S. conventional projects over the next four years. Todd contends that the market may still be underestimating COP's growth prospects beyond 2030, with massive growth potential across U.S. L48, Alaska, Norway, and Surmont and Montney in Canada.Todd is also impressed with ConocoPhillips' cost reduction efforts. He highlighted that COP has reduced adjusted operating costs by 8% or $900 million since 2024, with the 2026 outlook indicating another $400 million in cost reductions.Also, high-quality assets and lower costs are driving peer-leading free cash flow (FCF) growth for COP through 2030, with FCF/share estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% from 2025 to 2030 at $70/bbl Brent, higher than the peer average of 8%. While investors worry that most growth comes after the contribution from the Willow project starts in 2029, Todd contends that near-term catalysts are likely underestimated. Todd estimates pre-Willow FCF/share to grow by 6% per year from 2025 to 2028, which still makes COP rank third among peers.Todd ranks No. 716 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.4%. International Business MachinesFinally, we look at tech giant IBM (IBM), which returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter via dividends. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.22%.Following a meeting with the management, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on IBM stock with a price target of $315. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $349.Among the key takeaways, Daryanani highlighted that despite the uncertainties related to tariffs, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitics, management is optimistic about the broader macro backdrop and expects tech spending to be 2 to 3 points ahead of GDP growth. Over the medium term, IBM expects to sustain mid-single digit annual growth in its top line, driven by about 10% growth in the software business, better than-market growth in Consulting, and 1% to 3% increase in the Infrastructure segment revenue.The top-rated analyst also noted IBM's business transformation over the past five years, including the Red Hat acquisition and divestiture of GTS and other non-core assets. This transformation has helped IBM grow consistently with solid free cash flow and expansion in pre-tax income margin.Furthermore, Daryanani also discussed management's optimism about enterprise AI and a massive opportunity in the quantum space. \"We see multiple vectors for growth over the medium term,\" concluded Daryanani.Daryanani ranks No. 187 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.5%.",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% is likely to be defeated. A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"watch nowLegge said a 50% tax would likely lead to tax revenue falling. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse has called talk of an inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion\"\"We are dependent on good tax payers to finance our state,\" it warned.Legge said Switzerland faced competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, but added Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowWhen asked whether wealthy clients were scared, Giorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, told CNBC on Tuesday, \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management. We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. If successful, money raised from the tax would fund policies to combat climate change.",

    "body": "Shoppers and pedestrians move through the Pitt Street Mall during a Black Friday sale on Nov. 28, 2025 in Sydney, Australia.Lisa Maree Williams | Getty ImagesThe emergence of AI shopping doesn't just give consumers access to personalized advice and hassle-free shopping, it also brings with it an increased risk of digital fraud.This Black Friday, for the first time, consumers and retailers alike are being warned about the perils of so-called \"agentic shopping,\" as consumers turn to large language models to search for products, compare offerings, receive personalized recommendations, and even make purchases without much human input. These technological advances come with their own risks.  \"It definitely makes my life easier… but at the same time, it also makes fraudsters' life substantially easier as well,\" said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, an identity intelligence company that works on fraud prevention.According to Reitblat, there has been a 200% increase in agentic shopping by consumers over the past six months. That has been accompanied by a nearly tenfold increase in fraudsters using AI. \"Think of it as sending thousands of robots into different stores to masquerade as good consumers,\" Reitblat told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowWhile some retailers' knee-jerk reaction has been to simply ban AI purchases, that could be a faulty strategy as more and more consumers use AI for shopping and that is driving good quality traffic, Reitblat said.A report by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion found that among fashion executives, AI and digital tools were seen as the single biggest opportunity for the industry in 2026. To ensure products are visible and favored by AI models, brands must rethink marketing and e-commerce strategies, the report noted, adding that semantically rich data and API-accessible content will be critical to success.\"You need to use AI to fight AI,\" Reitblat said. \"You need to make sure that you're leveraging better data than fraudsters may have, and you need to properly think of: how do you authenticate the consumers?\"Shaky consumer confidenceValue-conscious consumers is another factor retailers have to deal with this year as heightened trade tensions and worries about a slowing economy impact consumers' spending habits.Consumer confidence has been shaky heading into the shopping season. In Europe, economic sentiment has remained stubbornly below its long-term average since mid-2022, according to data by the European Commission. Meanwhile in the U.S., consumer confidence hit its lowest point since April in November as concerns about job security mount.watch nowSome experts have suggested a split between wealthy consumers doing well and others that are cutting back on spending amid pressure from higher prices, in what has been dubbed the \"K-shaped economy.\"\"Consumer confidence has been bumpy, and therefore the customers feeling like they're getting genuine value is going to be a big thing for this year,\" said Curry's Chief Services Officer Dean Kramer. \"We know research is a big part of how consumers approach Black Friday, making sure they're getting absolute value.\"",

    "body": "Miniseries | GettyMany people saving in 401(k) accounts get a company match from their employer. But that money may not yet belong to them.A person may have to remain employed with a company for up to six years — nearly twice as long as the typical private-sector worker stays in a job — to take full control of those matching funds, which may pose an additional financial hit for those laid off in a cooling labor market. The 401(k) match is often referred to as \"free\" money: Employees who contribute to their 401(k) plan may get a matching contribution to their account from their employer, up to a certain amount.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageThat 'free' money in your 401(k) may not belong to you just yetAI data center 'frenzy' is pushing up your electric bill — here's why'Buyers may be a little disappointed' by Black Friday car deals: analystIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Depending on the match terms and a worker's earnings, the match money at stake could be worth thousands of dollars per year — and even more when compounded over decades of investing. The most common employer match formula — used by about 20% of employers — is to match half of the first 6% of a worker's salary, according to the PSCA. So, if a worker has 6% of each paycheck deposited into their 401(k), the employer would contribute an additional 3% to the 401(k).However, while workers may see the matching funds reflected in their 401(k) balance, most don't take ownership of it immediately. Just 44% of employers that pay a 401(k) match offered so-called \"immediate full vesting\" in 2024, according to PSCA data issued in November. In other words, all of the matching funds contributed by an employer belong to the worker immediately. Workers can take that money with them if they leave.For the rest, it may take many years — perhaps up to five or six — to own their full match. \"There might be a service requirement,\" said Hattie Greenan, the PSCA's director of research. \"It's often used as a way to reduce turnover, depending on the industry you're in.\"watch nowIn lieu of immediate full vesting of a 401(k) match, many companies offer \"graduated vesting.\" That means employees take ownership of their match in tranches over a number of years.For example, 15% of companies offer graduated vesting over a five-year period, according to PSCA data; an employee might gain 20% of their match per year for five years. Another 14% of companies offer six-year graduated vesting. Others have \"cliff\" vesting, meaning they give ownership of the full match to workers after the workers reach a specific tenure, but pay none before workers reach that length of service.About 10% of companies offer three-year cliff vesting, and another 7% offer two-year cliff vesting, according to the PSCA.The typical private-sector worker had a tenure of 3.5 years in early 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Leaving a job too soon or being laid off could be costly for retirement savings. The U.S. labor market has shown signs of weakness lately. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, reported that job cuts in October were the highest for the month in 22 years. It has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009, the firm said. Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest point since April amid anxiety over the job market.",

    "body": "Strathroy | Istock | Getty ImagesFor nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left.Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world.\"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\"Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. 'A gut punch'As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year.Craftsman working with compressed air at tombstone.Kzenon | Istock | Getty ImagesDioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad.\"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\"Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs.In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%.He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result.\"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\"In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect.Milano's showroom and a memorial made by the business.Courtesy: Jim MilanoBecause the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S.\"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades.Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices.Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term.blank stone gravestones and grave slabs in outdoor rural granite workshop.Krimkate | Istock | Getty ImagesBut memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers.\"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\"A changing businessEven before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials.The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029.Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one.He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets.\"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments. Call it 'financial nihilism.'Americans are getting flashbacks to 2008 as tariffs stoke recession fearsIs that a #RecessionIndicator? Social media users find concerning economic omens in places you wouldn't expectIf monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits.To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand.Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry members say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment.\"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\"",

    "body": "After the search for survivors and recovery of victims in tragic aviation accidents — like that of a UPS cargo plane shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky last month — comes the search for flight data and a cockpit voice recorder often called the \"black box.\" Every commercial plane has them. Aerospace giants GE Aerospace and Honeywell are among a few companies that design them to be nearly indestructible so they can help investigators understand the cause of a crash. \"They're very crucial because it's one of the few sources of information that tells us what happened leading up to the accident,\" said Chris Babcock, branch chief of the vehicle recorder division at the National Transportation Safety Board. \"We can get a lot of information from parts and from the airplane.\" Commercial aircraft have become very complex. A Boeing 787 Dreamliner records thousands of different pieces of information. In the case of the Air India crash in June, data revealed both engine fuel switches were put into a cutoff position within one second of each other. A voice recording from inside the cockpit captured the pilots discussing the cutoffs.\"All of those parameters today can have a very huge impact on the investigation,\" said former NTSB member John Goglia. \"It's our goal to to provide information back to our investigators who are on scene as quick as we can to help move the investigation forward.\"This crucial data can also help prevent future accidents. A crash can cost airlines or plane manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars and leave victims' families with a lifetime of grief.But in some circumstances black boxes were destroyed or never found. Experts say further developments such as cockpit video recorders and real-time data streaming are needed. \"The technology is there. Crash worthy cockpit video recorders are already being installed in a lot of helicopters and other types of airplanes, but they're not required,\" said Jeff Guzzetti, aviation analyst and former accident investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration and NTSB. \"There's privacy and cost issues involving cockpit video recorders but the NTSB has been recommending that the FAA require them for years now.\" ",

    "body": "A small replica of the Charging Bull statue is seen on a street vendor stall outside the New York Stock Exchange on July 11, 2025.Jeenah Moon | ReutersGlobal markets may be due for a reality check after this year's relentless rally, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday cautioned investors to brace for a drawdown over the next two years.Equities worldwide have been soaring, hitting record highs this year, driven by AI-linked gains and expectations of rate cuts. Over the past month, key U.S. indexes have scaled new peaks, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit fresh highs, while China's Shanghai Composite has notched its strongest level in a decade on easing U.S-China tensions and a softer dollar. \"It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. \"Things run, and then they pull back so people can reassess.\"However, Solomon noted that such reversals were a normal feature of long-term bull markets, noting that the investment bank's standing advice to clients remains to stay invested and review portfolio allocation, not attempt to time markets.\"A 10 to 15% drawdown happens often, even through positive market cycles,\" he said. \"It's not something that changes your fundamental, your structural belief as to how you want to allocate capital.\"Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick, speaking at the same panel, said investors should welcome periodic pullbacks, calling them healthy developments rather than signs of crisis.\"We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,\" he said.Solomon and Pick's views come on the back of recent warnings by the IMF of a possible sharp correction, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have also cautioned about inflated stock valuations.Bright spots in AsiaGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley pointed to Asia as a bright spot in the next few years on the back of recent developments including the trade pact between the U.S. and China. Goldman expects global capital allocators to continue to be interested in China, adding that it remains one of the \"largest and most important economies\" in the world.Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Hong Kong, China, Japan and India due to their unique growth stories. Japan's corporate-governance reforms and India's infrastructure build-out were singled out as multi-year investment themes.\"It's hard not to be excited about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India — three vastly different narratives, but all part of a global Asia story,\" Ted said. He highlighted the AI, EV and biotech sectors in China particularly.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersNorway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting this week, rebelling against management guidance and threats from Musk to step down if the deal is rejected.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund — the largest of its kind in the world, and a major shareholder in Tesla — said on Tuesday that it had already cast its vote against Musk's remuneration package as CEO of the carmaker.\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" NBIM said in a statement.\"We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\" the fund's managers added.Norway's wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, according to its half-year filings in June. The value of that investment was last declared to be 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion).Tesla shares were 2.5% lower in premarket trade.Tesla's Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve a pay plan for Musk that could see him granted almost $1 trillion in stock and expand his voting powers at the company. The full award would be contingent on Tesla hitting certain milestones over the next 10 years.The proposals have raised eyebrows and been met with opposition from some company watchers. Last month, the Take Back Tesla campaign — a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs — urged shareholders to reject the deal, while proxy advisories Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended investors vote against the compensation package.Musk has hit back at those recommendations, labeling ISS and Glass Lewis \"corporate terrorists\" on an analyst call.\"Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,\" Musk wrote in a post on X last month in response to a critic of the pay proposal. \"Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won't be me.\"Representatives for Musk and Tesla were not immediately available to comment on NBIM's vote against the proposed CEO compensation package.However, Musk has butted heads with NBIM over his pay in the past.Last year, NBIM voted against reinstating Musk's $56 billion pay deal after it was rescinded by a U.S. judge. The package — the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history — was ultimately approved by Tesla's shareholders.Following the vote, the Financial Times and Norwegian newspaper E24 published text messages exchanged between Musk and NBIM Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen, which showed the Tesla CEO declining an invitation to a dinner in Norwegian capital Oslo.\"When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends,\" Musk reportedly wrote. \"Friends are as friends do.\"Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $504.1 billion.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A Pizza Hut store is seen on November 01, 2023 in Austin, Texas. Pizza Hut's third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' expectations for same-store sales. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Tuesday announced that it will explore strategic options for Pizza Hut.\"The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,\" Yum CEO Chris Turner said in a statement.The company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the review process. While Yum did not specify what the review's \"range of strategic options\" include, potential outcomes could be an outright divestiture, a joint venture or the sale of a stake in the chain.Pizza Hut has been a part of a triumvirate with KFC and Taco Bell for decades, dating back to when PepsiCo still owned the fast-food chains. The beverage giant spun off the restaurants in 1997, christening the new company Tricon Global, later renamed to Yum.Tuesday's announcement caps years of struggle for Pizza Hut. On Tuesday, Yum reported that the chain's same-store sales fell 1% during the third quarter, fueled by a 6% drop in its home market. During the same quarter, Taco Bell and KFC reported same-store sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively. Before the pandemic, Pizza Hut tried to shrug off its reputation as a dine-in venue and reposition itself as an option for pizza delivery and carryout in the U.S. When Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered restaurants, the chain saw its sales skyrocket, like the rest of its pizza industry. But once restrictions loosened, so-called \"pizza fatigue\" settled in, leading to another sales slump.And now, with consumers dining out less often, Pizza Hut is facing increased competition for a smaller set of diners. The chain's share of the U.S. pizza market has shrunk from 22.6% in 2019 to 18.7% in 2024, ceding customers to rival Domino's Pizza, according to Barclays.In the wake of the pullback of consumer spending, other restaurant companies have recently shed challenged parts of their businesses in an effort to improve their balance sheets.Starbucks on Monday announced that it is selling a majority stake in its embattled China business and will form a joint venture with Boyu Capital. Last month, Jack in the Box divested Del Taco for $115 million, well short of the $575 million it paid for the chain less than four years ago. And Krispy Kreme sold its remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies this summer to focus on growing its U.S. business profitably.",

    "body": "Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPfizer on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and hiked its full-year profit guidance, as cost cuts helped to outweigh declining sales for the period.The pharmaceutical giant now expects its full-year adjusted profit to come in between $3 and $3.15 per share, up from a previous guidance of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. Pfizer said that reflects its \"solid\" performance for the year, \"continued confidence in our business\" and progress with reducing costs, among other factors. Pfizer said it also includes a one-time $1.35 billion charge tied to its licensing agreement with Chinese biotech 3SBio, which hit earnings by roughly 20 cents per share. The company said its 2025 guidance also accounts for President Donald Trump's current tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. It does not reflect Trump's threatened pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, as the company is exempt from those levies under a new drug pricing deal with the president.Pfizer maintained it full-year revenue guidance of $61 billion to $64 billion.Here's what the company reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 87 cents adjusted vs. 63 cents expectedRevenue: $16.65 billion vs. $16.58 billion expectedPfizer reported revenue of $16.65 billion for the second quarter, down 6% from the same period a year ago, largely due to lower demand for its Covid vaccine and Paxlovid, an antiviral pill for the virus. The company booked net income of $3.54 billion, or 62 cents per share. That compares with net income of $4.47 billion, or 78 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 87 cents for the quarter.Also on Tuesday, Pfizer said it's on track to cut costs by about $7.7 billion by the end of 2027 as part of two separate initiatives. As part of that, the company said it will slash costs by $4.5 billion by the end of 2025.The results come weeks after Pfizer became the first drugmaker to strike a deal with Trump to voluntarily sell its medications for less, as his administration pushes to link U.S. drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.Under the deal, Pfizer has agreed to a three-year grace period during which the company's products won't face Trump's threatened pharmaceutical-specific tariffs – as long as the drugmaker further invests in U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to invest $70 billion to reshore domestic drug manufacturing and research facilities.The results also come as Pfizer escalates a bidding war with Novo Nordisk for the obesity biotech Metsera. Pfizer on Monday filed its second lawsuit against the two companies, alleging that Novo Nordisk's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire Metsera is anticompetitive.",

    "body": "Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminalAhmed Jadallah | ReutersSaudi Aramco on Tuesday posted a 0.9% jump in third-quarter profit, beating expectations on the back of higher production even as oil prices remained under pressure.The world's largest oil company reported adjusted net income of 104.92 billion Saudi riyals ($27.98 billion) for the quarter, beating analyst expectations of 98.47 billion Saudi riyals, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.The results come as Aramco faces a profit squeeze amid weaker oil prices — down over 6% this year until September — except for a short-lived surge in the second quarter triggered by tensions between Israel and Iran.Year-to-date, spot prices of the U.S. West Texas Intermediate are down over 16%, data from FactSet showed. Similarly, the global benchmark Brent is down over 12%.\"We increased production with minimal incremental cost, and reliably supplied the oil, gas and associated products our customers depend on, driving strong financial performance and quarterly earnings growth,\" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said.Some other third-quarter highlights included:Third-quarter revenue came in at 418.16 billion Saudi riyals, beating analyst estimates of 411.26 billion Saudi riyals.Net debt stood at 114.33 billion Saudi riyals in the third quarter, down from 115.59 billion Saudi riyals three months earlier.Aramco reported a free cash flow of $23.6 billion compared with $22 billion a year earlier. The board also declared the 2025 base dividend of $21.1 billion and performance-linked dividend of $0.2 billion to be paid in the fourth quarter.Over the weekend, OPEC+ announced a modest increase in oil production for December and decided to halt further hikes during the first quarter of next year. The cartel members agreed to raise their December production target by 137,000 barrels per day, matching the hike for October and November.Since April, OPEC+ has raised its output targets by approximately 2.9 million barrels per day but began easing the pace of these increases in October over expectations of a market glut.Adding to the complexity, new Western sanctions on Russia, a key OPEC+ member, are posing difficulties for the group's production strategy, as Moscow faces limits in boosting output after the U.S. imposed additional restrictions on the country's major oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.Aramco recently completed its acquisition of a 22.5% stake in Petro Rabigh, Reuters reported, from Japan's Sumitomo Chemical for $701.8 million, bringing the Saudi company's total ownership to roughly 60%.The oil giant also recently acquired a minority stake in artificial intelligence company HUMAIN, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.Nasser added that the company's stake in HUMAIN is expected to further drive innovation and progress its role in the \"crucial and rapidly evolving AI sector.\"",

    "body": "The BP logo is displayed on a petrol tanker delivering fuel at a petrol station in Shepton Mallet on October 20, 2025 in Somerset, England.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil giant BP on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit as higher crude and gas production outweighed a weak oil trading result.The London-listed oil and gas major posted underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.21 billion for July-September period. That beat analyst expectations of $2.03 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.BP's third-quarter net profit came in at $2.3 billion last year and $2.35 billion in the second quarter of 2025.\"We've delivered another quarter of good performance across the business with operations continuing to run well,\" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement.\"We are looking to accelerate delivery of our plans, including undertaking a thorough review of our portfolio to drive simplification and targeting further improvements in cost performance and efficiency,\" Auchincloss said.The oil major's third-quarter net debt came in at $26.05 billion, broadly flat from the previous quarter, although up from $24.27 billion a year earlier.London-listed shares of BP rose 0.5% on Tuesday morning.Some other third-quarter highlights included:Operating cash flow came in at $7.8 billion, up from $6.3 billion three months ago.BP said it expects divestment and other proceeds to be above $4 billion in 2025.BP also announced another $750 million in share buybacks over the next three months, maintaining the pace of its shareholder returns, albeit at a reduced level from earlier in the year.The results come just over eight months after the company launched a fundamental strategic reset.BP, which has been the subject of intense takeover speculation, is looking to regain investor confidence by slashing renewable spending and prioritizing its traditional oil and gas business.Investors appear to have broadly welcomed the oil and gas major's green strategy U-turn, with share prices up more than 13% year-to-date. The improving sentiment has also been attributed to the firm's leadership shake-up, progress on its cost-cutting program and a string of recent oil discoveries.BP on Monday announced it had agreed to sell minority stakes in some of its U.S. onshore pipeline assets in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to private investor Sixth Street for $1.5 billion. BP has previously said it is targeting $20 billion in divestments by the end of 2027.Last week, British rival Shell reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, citing robust operational performance and higher trading contributions.",

    "body": "Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Lisa Cook speaks on \"The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy\" at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 3, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in her first policy speech since President Donald Trump tried to remove her from office, said Monday that she supported the recent interest rate reduction and indicated she would be open to more.Since Trump made his move in August to sack Cook on accusations of mortgage fraud, she has kept a relatively low profile outside of the court battles that have kept her in her position at the central bank.In remarks before the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., the policymaker laid out her views on the economy and where she thinks monetary policy should land. Generally, she sees the economy as solid with risks to both the Fed's goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.Cook said she sided with the 10-2 vote on the Federal Open Market Committee to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the second meeting in a row that saw a cut.\"I viewed that decision as appropriate, because I believe that the downside risks to employment are greater than the upside risks to inflation. I view the latest reduction in the fed funds rate as another gradual step toward normalization,\" she said.Trump has been blocked by courts from removing Cook in what has been seen as a pivotal issue for central bank independence. Though White House officials have said Cook lied in forms she filled out for federally guaranteed home mortgages, she has not been convicted of anything nor have any charges even been brought. Cook has cited \"clerical errors\" in the loan applications. She declined to comment on the matter during a question-and-answer session, saying \"it would be inappropriate\" while noting she is \"beyond grateful\" for the support she has received.In the meantime, she has continued her duties at the Fed, which lowered its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December.As for the path going forward, Cook said she is sticking with a data-dependent position. FOMC officials in September indicated an additional cut is likely before the end of the year.\"As always, I determine my monetary policy stance each meeting based on the incoming data from a wide variety of sources, the evolution of my outlook, and the balance of risks,\" she said. \"Every meeting, including December's, is a live meeting.\"\"Certainly we want to see if tariff effects are persistent, to see if firms are waiting to raise prices, to see what they've done with inventory,\" she added. \"So there's a lot to look at. There's a lot to anticipate with the December meeting coming up.\"Fed Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets during his Wednesday post-meeting news conference when he said the December cut is not a sure thing. Powell noted a wide dispersion of opinions on the committee, known more often for its consensus approach to policy.\"Looking ahead, policy is not on a predetermined path,\" Cook said, using what has become boilerplate language for Fed officials. \"We are at a moment when risks to both sides of the dual mandate are elevated.\"On inflation, she said Trump's tariffs have not fully made their way through the economy. However, she said the most likely outcome is a \"one-time increase\" in prices not likely to fuel inflation over the longer term.",

Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesNintendo raised its forecast for sales of the Switch 2 console in its current fiscal year as momentum for its new flagship console grows.The Japanese gaming giant said it now expects to sell 19 million units of the Switch in the fiscal year ending March 2026 versus a previous forecast of 15 million units.Here's how Nintendo did in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 versus LSEG estimates:Revenue: 527.2 billion Japanese yen ($3.7 billion) versus 461.76 billion yen expected.Net profit: 102.9 billion Japanese yen versus 63.6 billion yen expected.Revenue was up over 90% year-on-year while profit rose more than 270%.Nintendo is riding a wave of momentum after launching its latest console called the Switch 2 in June, with the stock up nearly 40% this year.Nintendo said it sold 4.54 million units of the Switch 2 in the September quarter. That was a decline compared to the \"high demand seen immediately following the launch of Nintendo Switch 2\" during its fiscal first quarter, Nintendo said, adding that \"performance remained strong.\"In total, Nintendo has sold 10.36 million units of the Switch 2 since launch.watch now\"Mario Kart World\" and \"Donkey Kong Bonanza\" have proved to be two of Nintendo's most popular games since the Switch 2 launch, helping the company record 11.95 million units of software sold for the console in the quarter.Nintendo's optimism around the Switch 2 prompted the company to also raise other financial forecasts. The Kyoto-headquartered firm said it now sees net sales at 2.25 trillion yen for its fiscal year versus a previous forecast of 1.9 trillion yen. It also hiked its net profit outlook by nearly 17% to 350 billion yen.New games in focusNintendo's original Switch, first released in 2017, has become its second-best selling console of all time after the Nintendo DS. The hybrid nature – where people could play the console at home and on the go – has caught on.There were questions swirling over whether Nintendo's Switch 2 would be different enough from its predecessor to entice users. So far, initial Switch 2 sales appear to be strong for Nintendo. Investors will now assess the current quarter and demand during the critical holiday season.Nintendo managed to maintain sales for the original Switch over several years thanks to games based around key franchises like Super Mario and Pokemon, a playbook it is looking to replicate with the Switch 2.Last month, Nintendo released \"Pokémon Legends: Z-A\" as well as an offer that bundles the game with the Switch 2 console. \"Kirby Air Riders\" and \"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond\" are also scheduled for this year.\"We will aim to keep the momentum of released titles and continuously introduce new titles to expand the platform's user base,\" Nintendo said in its earnings release.",

    "body": "watch nowStarbucks on Monday announced it is forming a joint venture with Boyu Capital to operate the company's locations in China.Under the terms of the deal valued at $4 billion, Boyu, an alternative asset management firm, will hold up to a 60% interest in the joint venture. Starbucks will hold a 40% stake and maintain its ability to license the brand and intellectual property to the joint venture.The announcement comes after the coffee giant conducted a months-long review of options that included strategic partnerships. Starbucks values its China business at more than $13 billion, the company said. The valuation includes the sale of the controlling stake in the joint venture, combined with the value of both its retained interest and the ongoing licensing fees that will paid to the company in the future.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, pending regulatory approval.Starbucks opened its first store in China in 1999. By 2015, it had grown to become the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States.\"Building on our positive business momentum, our partnership with Boyu will enable Starbucks China to fully unlock the vast market opportunity,\" Molly Liu, CEO of Starbucks China, said in a statement.Today, the company has roughly 8,000 locations in China, but Starbucks has big ambitions for the market. CEO Brian Niccol told CNBC's Kate Rogers in September that the country could one day have 20,000 or even 30,000 locations nationwide.But in recent years, Starbucks has seen its sales in China plummet, first due to the pandemic and related government restrictions and later caused by increased competition. Rival Luckin Coffee now has more stores in China than Starbucks and has won over customers with lower-priced drinks than the U.S. coffee chain.On Wednesday, the company reported that its fiscal-fourth quarter same-store sales in China increased 2%, fueled by a 9% increase in traffic. However, as Starbucks has leaned into discounting to compete with local rivals, the average ticket at its Chinese cafes has fallen, weighing on the company's profits.While Starbucks executives have continually expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects in China, its weak performance in the country has weighed on Starbucks' overall financial results.For decades, China's massive population and fast-growing economy have made it an attractive market for U.S. companies. But in recent years, an economic slowdown and greater competition from home-grown brands have made some companies rethink their strategies.Earlier this year, Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International bought its struggling China business from TFI Asia Holdings with the goal of selling it to another operator. On the other hand, McDonald's increased its minority stake in its China business from 20% to 48% two years ago, aiming to benefit from the market's growth.",

The rule changes the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to exclude certain organizations \"that engage in unlawful activities\" such as \"supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration,\" according to an Education Department statement.PSLF, signed into law in 2007 by George W.

    "body": "Alex Karp, Palantir CEO, joins CNBC's ‘Squawk on the Street’ on June 5, 2025. CNBCPalantir CEO Alex Karp took on a familiar target during the company's earnings call on Monday: His critics.\"Please turn on the conventional television and see how unhappy those that didn't invest in us are,\" Karp said, after the data analytics company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. \"Enjoy, get some popcorn, they're crying. We are every day making this company better and we're doing it for this nation, for allied countries.\"Palantir shares are up 25-fold in the past three years, lifting its market cap to over $490 billion and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of almost 280. The stock slipped in extended trading despite the earnings beat and upbeat guidance. Karp, who co-founded the company in 2003, said Palantir is \"going to go very, very deep on our rightness\" because it is \"exceedingly good for America.\"The eccentric and outspoken CEO has gained a reputation over the years for his colorful — and oftentimes political — commentary in interviews, shareholder letters and on earnings calls. His essay-like quarterly letters have previously quoted famous philosophers, the New Testament and President Richard Nixon.In Monday's letter, Karp quoted 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats and argued for a shared \"national experience.\" He wrote that rejecting a \"shared and defined sense of common culture\" poses significant drawbacks.It's \"that pursuit of something greater, and rejection of a vacant and neutered and hollow pluralism, that will help ensure our continued strength and survival,\" he wrote.On the call, Karp pivoted from a discussion of artificial intelligence adoption to fentanyl overdoses in America, a topic he described as \"slightly political.\"\"I want people to remember if fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads instead of 60,000 working class people, we would be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it from South America,\" he said.Karp also commented on the company's deals with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Israeli military. Earlier this year, Palantir won a $30 million deal to build ImmigrationOS for ICE, providing data on the identification and deportation of immigrants.In 2023, Karp had a message for people in the tech industry who have misgivings about his company's dealings with intelligence agencies and the military.\"You may not agree with that and, bless you, don't work here,\" Karp said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Palantir, which gets more than half its U.S. revenue from the government, also provided tools to Israel after the deadly Oct. 7 attack by militant group Hamas. In recent years, both Karp and the company have undertaken a fiercely pro-Israel stance.Following the Oct. 7 attack, Palantir took out a full-page ad in The New York Times, saying it \"stands with Israel\" and held its first board meeting in Tel Aviv, Israel, a few months later. Karp has said the company has lost employees due to his staunch Israel stance, and he expects more to leave.\"We're on the front line of all adversaries, including vis-à-vis China, we're on ICE and we've supported Israel,\" he said on the earnings call. \"I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial.\"WATCH: Stocks like Palantir and Mag 7 are not 'unique' to the market, says Richard Bernsteinwatch now",

    "body": "Tesla models Y and 3 are displayed at a Tesla showroom in Corte Madera, California, on Dec. 20, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesTesla has been ordered to provide records to U.S. federal auto safety regulators to comply with a sweeping investigation into possible safety defects with the company's flush-mounted, retractable door handles that can lead to people getting trapped.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a letter to Elon Musk's automaker that the agency continued to receive complaints from Tesla owners after the regulators initiated a probe in September.Owners said they were unable to enter or exit their cars due to battery power loss and other situations impeding normal use of the doorhandles.In some cases, owners' children were trapped inside hot vehicles, requiring first responder interventions or breaking windows to open the doors.NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations said they had \"received 16 reports of exterior door handles becoming inoperative due to low 12VDC battery voltage in certain MY 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles,\" as of October 27, 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsMicrosoft plans to hire more but with 'a lot more leverage' thanks to AI, CEO Satya Nadella saysWhile AI spending is top of mind, online ads are driving a lot of Big Tech's growthMicrosoft AI chief says only biological beings can be consciousMusk teases Tesla Roadster demo by year-end. He's been hyping a new one since 2017The agency began the electronic door handles investigation into Tesla following a Bloomberg report bringing incidents to light. The news agency reported that people were injured or died after becoming trapped in Tesla vehicles after collisions or battery power losses that prevented doors from opening normally.Tesla design leader Franz Von Holzhausen has said in subsequent press interviews that the company would change the design of its door handles.Tesla competitors, including Rivian, are also reconsidering flush-mounted, or retractable door handle designs.Volkswagen CEO Thomas Schäfer recently said his company's customers don't even want the flush-mounted, electronic doorhandles and VW has no plans to adopt them.Meanwhile, China is expected to implement new vehicle safety standards around door handles, including a requirement to have more clearly marked, accessible and easier-to-use emergency, interior door release mechanisms.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released draft standards and comments are open through November 22.The NHTSA Tesla probe seeks records concerning all model year, \"2021 Tesla Model Y vehicles manufactured for sale or lease in the United States,\" as well as \"peer vehicles,\" including Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles from model years 2017 to 2022, and \"systems related to opening doors including, door handles, door latches, 12VDC batteries, software,\" and other components.Tesla has until Dec. 10 to provide the records.While Tesla can seek an extension on the deadline from NHTSA, it may face fines of \"$27,874 per violation per day, with a maximum of $139,356,994\" if the company either fails to or refuses to \"respond completely, accurately, or in a timely manner\" to NHTSA's information requests, the agency cautioned in its letter.",

Half of India's internet users report using some form of AI, she added.India has one of the highest smartphone and internet penetration rates in the world. \"With over 700 million internet users and widespread smartphone penetration, India generates massive volumes of data, which is the fuel for training AI models,\" a Boston Consulting Group report said in June.The country's AI market is projected to exceed $17 billion by 2027, making it one of the fastest-growing in the world, BCG added.watch nowAI players are not just building a \"simple user base; it is a new data and cognition infrastructure, powered by human engagement and trained at a national scale,\" Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief executive officer of US-based Greyhound Research.He added that AI platforms offered through telecom providers will also shape enterprise behavior. \"The tools that your employees experiment with at home today become the same ones they use at work tomorrow,\" he said.India's AI workforce is expected to grow from about 650,000 professionals to more than 1.27 million by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 15%, according to 2024 estimates shared by India's IT and tech industry body NASSCOM.AI is driving demand for jobs in data science, data curation, AI engineering, and analytics in India. As of August 2025, around 865,000 candidates have enrolled or trained in various emerging technology courses, including 320,000 in AI and Big Data Analytics.\"India is becoming the bot training capital of the world,\" Saurabh Mukherjea, founder and chief investment officer of Marcellus Investment Managers, told CNBC.

Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesDe-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S. after their leaders met in South Korea last Thursday stands in stark contrast to the chill in Washington-New Delhi relations, with India now subject to higher U.S. tariffs than Beijing.Experts said that the strategic relationship between India and U.S. built over two decades has substantially eroded.Atman Trivedi a partner and lead of the South Asia Practice at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group said trust between the two countries \"could take years rebuild.\"Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"President Trump evidently does not value India as a partner in balancing China as much as the previous presidents,\" said Raymond Vickery Jr., senior associate and chair on India and emerging Asia Economics at Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. foreign policy from President Bill Clinton until recently, including Trump's first term as the president, had consistently valued \"democratic India over autocratic China,\" he said, adding that the approach toward India has now shifted from one of strategic altruism to \"transactionalism.\"Meanwhile, ties between the U.S. and China appear to be on the mend.In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said \"My G2 meeting President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries\" adding that it would lead to \"everlasting peace and success.\"  Shortly after, Pete Hegseth, U.S. secretary of defense, said on X that China and the U.S. had agreed to set up \"miliary-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate\" any problems.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday which saw Washington cutting tariffs on Beijing related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%.China now pays a lower tariff than India.In August the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India including secondary duties of 25% for its purchase of Russian oil. India has called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,\" while has called U.S. trade ties with India \"a totally one-sided disaster!\"U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images\"At the leader-level, the chemistry is missing for now, and the impact of this disconnect on the U.S.-India relationship probably cannot be overstated,\" Trivedi added.During his Asia trip last week, while addressing corporate leaders at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, Trump said he threatened India and Pakistan with 250% tariffs unless they stopped hostilities.An attack by militants in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir in April killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan and launched a military strike, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two countries.\"The strategic relationship between India and the U.S. has been under strain this year not just because of tariffs, but also because of Washington's posture in the conflict with Pakistan and the apparent warming of [U.S.] ties with Pakistan's military,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research at Oxford Economics.Trump's claims are being picked up by Modi's political opponents including the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Modi is \"scared\" of U.S. President Donald Trump, Gandhi reportedly said on Sunday in a political rally in Bihar.Hermann added that now the challenge for India would be to find its position between two economic superpowers.\"While New Delhi stands to benefit from greater access to U.S. demand, its dependence on China is unlikely to diminish in the near term given the still-extreme uncertainty around trade policy and the costs of relocating supply chains,\" she said.Keeping aside strained trade ties, U.S. and India on Friday signed a 10-year \"Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership.\"Hegseth said on X that the two countries were improving \"coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation,\" while his Indian counter Rajnath Singh said the partnership between U.S. and India was \"critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.\"Experts warn if U.S. sticks with its transactional approach toward India, it will drive the two further apart, compromising strategic interests of both.\"The Trump policy will push India further toward Russia, the Global South, and even China. This will not be in the interests of either India or the US,\" said Vickery Jr. from CSIS.",

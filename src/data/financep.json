    "body": "Businesswoman working on laptop in modern office spaceMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesStudent debt has long been considered difficult, if not impossible, to discharge in bankruptcy. But that hasn't been the case in recent years, a new study finds. The success rate for student loan borrowers who attempt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy has \"jumped\" to 87%, according to an analysis published in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal this month by Jason Iuliano, a professor at the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law. In 2017, the success rate for education debt holders in bankruptcy was 61%, and in 2007, it was 40%, Iuliano found. \"People who file for discharge are winning at very high rates,\" Iuliano told CNBC. His study used a final dataset of 652 bankruptcy discharge cases from October 2022 to November 2023 that included student loans.

What you can expectHere's the inflation breakdown for November 2025 — in one chartCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe improved outcomes for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy stem, in large part, from updated bankruptcy guidelines the Biden administration issued. In November 2022, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice rolled out a policy that experts say treats student loans more like other types of debt in bankruptcy court. Borrowers can fill out a 15-page attestation form, detailing their financial struggles and making their case for a mulligan. The Trump administration has not rescinded that guidance. An Education Department spokesperson told CNBC the agency has no current plans to change the approach.More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, government data shows.Easier process is 'life-changing' for someAmid concerns that young people would try to avoid their financial obligations, policymakers began passing laws in the mid-1970s that raised the bar for discharging student debt in court. Government attorneys battled the cases, and some people needed to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" and \"undue hardship.\" Malissa Giles, a bankruptcy attorney in Virginia, said the easier bankruptcy process has been \"life-changing\" for her clients, many of whom have carried their student debt for decades. \"It allows them to sleep at night,\" she said. Women made up 73% of the student loan bankruptcy filers in the cases Iuliano reviewed. The average student loan balance for the filers was $115,000, but 10% of the borrowers owed more than $240,000. The debtors ranged in age from 24 to 76. Student debt not dischargeable is a 'myth' While the odds for student loan borrowers in bankruptcy have slowly improved, many people still don't bother to file the separate lawsuit required for the discharge of student debt, called an adversary proceeding, Iuliano found. More than 3 million student loan borrowers filed for bankruptcy between 2011 and 2024. But only 7,293 of those individuals took the additional step of requesting a student loan discharge, he writes in his study. \"The myth that student loans are never dischargeable in bankruptcy is so pervasive that many attorneys never even raise the possibility with their clients,\" Iuliano told CNBC.  \"However, the new attestation process is so streamlined that bankruptcy attorneys should be recommending it to every client with student loans,\" he said. Bankruptcy can be 'the only real path out' The easier bankruptcy process may offer a lifeline to many Americans struggling with education debt. Student loan holders have been under pressure from a weakening labor market, a barrage of changes to the lending system and recent trouble accessing relief programs, including debt forgiveness and affordable repayment plans. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the Education Department recently confirmed to CNBC. \"For many people, interest and fees have turned the balance into something they can never repay, so bankruptcy is the only real path out,\" Iuliano said.

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

    "body": "With 2026 around the corner, many people are eyeing tips and tricks to bring into the new year at home and at work.And while many are considering a new morning or evening routine, there are two other routines you might want to incorporate into your schedule, specifically at work, to better focus when you need to and disconnect at the end of the day, says Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and author of several books on focus and productivity.Newport is a proponent of using time blocking to reserve time during your day for deep work, meaning the tasks that are most cognitively demanding.The first routine Newport recommends is for the run-up to a deep work block.\"Our brain is not wired for sustained concentration on an abstract or symbolic topic,\" Newport says. \"Give your brain time, give it some help shifting over into deep work mode because it's a very unnatural thing you're asking your brain to do.\"Many workers are constantly bombarded with notifications throughout their day. A Microsoft report from April found that employees are interrupted every 2 minutes by emails, meetings or pings. The brain is in a very different state managing all of that digital noise than when you're zeroed in on deep work, so it takes to switch between these modes.Before a deep work block on your calendar, you might take a quick walk around the block, make tea, or clean your desk — something you can repeat and use as a signal to your brain it's time to switch modes. Think of it like stretching before you go on a run.\"You can't just shut down your inbox, open Microsoft Word and think, 'Now I'm focused,'\" Newport says.At the end of your workday, you also need a shutdown routine.\"It's a way of clearing out your brain after work so it's not going to be held partially hostage by work thoughts for your time outside of work,\" Newport says.His shutdown routine as he signs off at the end of his workday includes doing a final inbox check, looking ahead on his work calendar and writing down any reminders.At the end of it, you should feel, \"We're in a good place, there's nothing else I need to figure out tonight, we're on track for the things we need to get done.\" Then, you should have \"some sort of visible shutdown statement or routine to indicate you've finished.\" Newport, for example, checks off a box that says \"Shutdown complete\" as the last step.A shutdown routine won't magically put an end to your work anxiety, but it can \"help teach your brain to slow down work ruminations.\"\"Instead of engaging with the ruminations, you say I checked that checkbox and I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't gone through everything and convinced myself we're in a good position to shut down for the day,\" Newport says.\"It prevents you from the temptation of maybe I should just go check my inbox,\" he adds. \"It helps you move on from work in a way that eventually your brain learns so you can get more out of your life outside work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "This is the season when everyone's planning for next year. When it comes to money, I can assure you that the secret isn't in some fancy investing tactic, hot stock tip, or obscure cryptocurrency. If you and your partner set just one money resolution for 2026, make it this: You both stay actively involved in your finances.As a financial advisor for more than 20 years who's operated my own wealth management firm for nine, I know that this is the single most impactful commitment most couples can make. Yet it's missing in so many relationships. The dangers of disconnecting Leaving the money to be handled by one spouse leaves your family vulnerable. If something happens to the person handling everything (illness, death, or even divorce), the other is left to scramble. I've helped heartbroken spouses try to piece together accounts, passwords, and plans during the worst moments imaginable, and I wouldn't wish this outcome upon anyone. But even in less dramatic circumstances, it's still ineffective to leave one overwhelmed person to make all the decisions. You miss out on the power of two perspectives, and the disengaged spouse loses their agency and confidence. I've sat across from countless couples who, even with the best intentions, have lost the plot over time. Most of them never addressed the subtle shifts in their dynamic that made it easier for one partner to take the lead with their money. I'd often end up with just one client at our financial planning meetings, and their partner, I was told, was too busy, disinterested, apprehensive, or overwhelmed to join us. For a long time, I didn't understand why, until it happened in my own home. 'This isn't working anymore'During the pandemic, my wife, Heather, was juggling too much: lawyering in the general counsel's office of a Fortune 100 company, moonlighting as my business consultant for my wealth management firm, and keeping me and our two daughters clothed, fed, entertained, and safe. As a result of the physical, mental, and emotional labor she was carrying for all of us, she disconnected from our household finances. Money felt like the one thing she didn't have to worry about. In truth, it was the one thing I was willing to own from start to finish, and it was damaging to our relationship. I'm grateful she had the courage to say, \"This isn't working anymore.\" The tough conversations that followed caused us to rethink what we wanted out of our careers, how we divided labor, and how we could approach money as a team again. Make yourselves a money teamTalking about money is never just about money, which inspired Heather and me to spend two years interviewing other couples for our new book, \"Money Together: How to Find Fairness in Your Relationship and Become an Unstoppable Financial Team.\" Effective communication is the bedrock. Here are some ways to connect with intention, move beyond the numbers, and engage in your finances together — even when it's the harder thing to do.Start with an honest review. Schedule a distraction-free time and place to get into everything. Do you both have access to your accounts? Are all passwords saved in your password managers? You should both have a baseline understanding of your net worth. Review what you earn (cash flow), what you have (assets and investments), what you owe (debt), and what you want (goals). Examine time, from each of your perspectives. Ask whether each of you feels you have the time to do what you want and need to do. You may need to shuffle responsibilities and automate or outsource less-critical tasks to free up time for finances. Create a regular practice. Make recurring money dates non-negotiable. We suggest having them quarterly, which won't become overwhelming and will create enough space between meetings to recognize real progress.  Meet your partner where they are. I've often encountered couples where one partner has less knowledge or comfort with all things finances than the other, and that, in part, is why they've disengaged. It can feel daunting. Tailor your approach to your partner's learning style, checking in to see what resonates.Bring in outside help if needed. A neutral financial advisor or therapist who specializes in money dynamics can guide tough conversations without bias, and offer financial advice that's tailored to your specific situation. When Heather and I finally reconnected around money, it secured our wallets and also deepened our relationship. Make 2026 the year you prioritize staying connected to your finances together — I know from experience just how transformative it can be. Douglas A.

Ukranian Presidency | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkraine's president, Volodymr Zelenskyy, said Monday that he has asked for up to 50 years' worth of security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the weekend.Commenting on the talks with Trump in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy told journalists that he said a meeting with Russia would only be possible after the president and European leaders had agreed on a framework peace deal for Ukraine. The comments, reported by Reuters on Monday, included Zelenskyy stating that he had asked for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, but that the current 20-point peace plan envisaged guarantees — aimed at deterring future Russian aggression — for 15 years.

Any peace plan should be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, he added, noting that any vote to approve or reject the agreement should be held during a 60-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy said \"Russia clearly does not want a ceasefire for now\" after several days of heavy drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's comments come after talks with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Sunday. Trump said the discussions had gone well but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy described the talks as a \"really great discussion\" in which security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, but Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.watch nowWhen asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia and has rejected security guarantees for Kyiv so far. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls for the Donbas, which is mostly but not fully occupied by Russian forces, to be handed to Moscow. It's unclear whether Zelenskyy would meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a peace agreement was agreed in principle, with both leaders vehemently refusing to meet in the past.Trump said he had spoken with Putin about peace proposals during a phone conversation on Sunday but signalled that Russia had not appeared to support a ceasefire to allow for a referendum in Ukraine. He divulged few other details about the call, which he said lasted two hours. When asked to comment on the U.S.-Ukraine talks which followed that call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: \"We don't know how they went. We can't judge. After these talks, the two presidents — I mean the President of Russia and the President of the United States — agreed to have a phone call again. Then we'll get the information.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting to this story.",

    "body": "The logo of Japanese company SoftBank Group at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on November 21, 2025.         Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's SoftBank on Monday said it has agreed to buy data center investment firm DigitalBridge for $4 billion as part of its artificial intelligence push.The deal, which has been unanimously approved by a special committee of DigitalBridge's board of directors, will see SoftBank acquire all the outstanding common stock of DigitalBridge for $16 per share in cash. This represents a 15% premium to DigitalBridge's closing share price on Dec. 26. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, according to a SoftBank statement.SoftBank CEO and Chairman Masayoshi Son said the acquisition \"will strengthen the foundation for next-generation AI data centers\" and advance the firm's vision to become a leading \"Artificial Super Intelligence\" platform provider.\"As AI transforms industries worldwide, we need more compute, connectivity, power, and scalable infrastructure,\" Son said in a statement.Shares of DigitalBridge jumped about 10%. The firm's share price had climbed as much as 50% after Bloomberg reported a deal could be imminent.The agreement between SoftBank and DigitalBridge comes amid a global boom for the infrastructure that underpins AI applications.\"The buildout of AI infrastructure represents one of the most significant investment opportunities of our generation,\" DigitalBridge CEO Marc Ganzi said in a statement.SoftBank's \"vision, capital strength, and global network will allow us to accelerate our mission with greater flexibility, invest with a longer-term horizon on behalf of our investors, and better serve the world's leading technology companies as they scale their AI ambitions,\" he added.SoftBank recently sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion to make room for its investment in OpenAI.DigitalBridge describes itself as \"a unique digital infrastructure business,\" and had roughly $108 billion of assets under management as of the end of September, according to its website.

    "body": "A selection of one kilogram silver bars at Conclude Zrt bullion dealer arranged in Budapest, Hungary, on Monday, Feb. 17, 2025. Akos Stiller | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOne of the best trades of the year just staged a massive reversal.Silver futures fell 8.7% on Monday, after topping $80 an ounce for the first time ever in overnight trading. The precious metal settled at $70.46 an ounce. It was the worst day for silver futures since February 2021.The move is even more dramatic on an intraday basis. Peak to trough, silver plunged 15%, the biggest high-to-low change going back to August 2020 when it dropped 16.85%. \"This is a historic move,\" said Jeff Kilburg, CEO and chief investment officer of KKM Financial. \"We haven't seen a move like this in a long time.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver futures for March, year to dateHe attributed the pullback to profit-taking, as well as tax-loss harvesting at the end of a calendar year, that dented silver's advance after its huge run-up. The precious metal is still higher by more than 140% year to date. It started 2025 trading just above $20 per ounce.That has helped the precious metal outperform even gold this year. Gold futures for February, which recently topped $4,550 for the first time ever this month, are higher by more than 60% this year. Gold futures dropped about 4.6% on the day, settling at $4,343.6. There are a number of reasons for the huge gains. Alongside gold, silver is viewed as a safe haven for investors wary of heightened geopolitical tensions and other risks, like the ballooning U.S. deficit. The two metals are also viewed as stores of value, meaning they can act as hedges against a U.S. dollar that weakens due to inflation or economic uncertainty. Additionally, a weaker greenback also makes the assets cheaper for other countries, driving up demand. What's more, silver benefited from strong industrial demand for electronics such as solar panels, data centers and electric vehicles.KKM Financial's Kilburg expects those tail winds can continue to push silver higher in 2026. He thinks silver can climb to $90 or even $100, implying upside of roughly 27% or 40%, respectively, from where it was last trading. \"I think this is a reset, a reprieve, just a one-day end-of-year move. But I think both precious metals — gold and silver — continue their trajectory higher,\" said Kilburg. \"There's a dramatic supply issue. There's a tremendous demand issue. And you couple those two together, that is going to push silver higher,\" he said. \"So, I don't think the rally is over by any means.\" — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "A 2025 poll from the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan asked American parents of children ages one to 18 about their views on various child health topics including bullying, internet safety, lack of physical activity, parental stress and diet.The Mott poll report, released in August, found that a majority of parents surveyed, 69%, think the physical health of American children and teens is getting worse. And even more parents are worried about their kids' emotional wellbeing: 83% believe the mental health of U.S. children and teens is also on the decline.Results of the poll also show that parents believe social media, too much screen time, and internet safety to be some of the top concerns kids are facing today.\"Since the increased use of social media starting around 2010, the prevalence of mental health problems in youth has also increased significantly,\" according to the report. \"This increase, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts continued through the COVID-19 pandemic years.\"Jonathan Haidt, social scientist and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is one of the many experts sounding an alarm about the connection between increased anxiety and depression among young people and smartphones and social media.\"All these devices are designed to keep kids scrolling for hours and hours,\" he previously told CNBC Make It. \"The average screen time is eight to 10 hours, not including school.\" \"We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy,\" he said.Haidt encourages parents to be more intentional about reducing their child's use of devices and social media. Here, he and Jean Twenge, a psychology professor and author of \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" offer up some recommendations for how parents can work to get that done.No smartphones before high schoolHaidt argues for a clear boundary: Kids should not get a smartphone before they reach high school. A global study of 27,969 18-to-24-year-olds by nonprofit Sapien Labs found that mental wellbeing improved the older the age of first ownership of a smartphone. Haidt also recommends parents refrain from enabling the use of social media on kids' phones before the age of 16.When kids get their devices, Haidt suggests parents have a designated place for them.\"They live on the kitchen counter,\" Haidt said as an example. \"If you need it, you check it out.\"No screens in the bedroom overnight Twenge advocates for keeping screens out of the bedroom overnight.\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" Twenge previously told CNBC Make It.Devices in the bedroom can disrupt children's sleep, whether they're up late scrolling or their notifications are waking them up. \"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge wrote in her book \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World.\"Haidt would go a step further: no screens in the bedroom whatsoever, he said.More free play outside To ensure kids don't get too sucked into their devices, Haidt also recommends parents encourage them to spend time outside with friends.Communities can decide to enact what he calls \"free play Fridays.\"\"Everyone knows that's when kids get together at the park, they play baseball, football, whatever,\" he previously told Make It. \"Maybe they just stay at the school playground.\"Ultimately, playing with friends and without screens is \"the most fun kids can have,\" he said. They might have so much, they'll ask to continue spending time with their friends over the weekend. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

    "body": "Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 8, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCDETROIT — General Motors is on pace to be the top U.S.-traded automaker stock of 2025, as shares of GM are having their best year since the Detroit company's reemergence from bankruptcy in 2009.GM stock is up over 55% to a record of more than $80 per share, as of Friday's close, topping the company's previous annual increase of 48.3% last year. That includes a nearly 13% rise so far in December, adding to five consecutive months of share gains, according to FactSet.Several factors have been driving the share increase. But GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives have contended for years that the automaker's stock has been significantly undervalued given its consistent earnings performance.\"Great vehicles, innovative technology, a rewarding customer experience, along with strong financial results, will continue to set GM apart in an increasingly competitive landscape,\" Barra said during the company's last quarterly earnings call in October.Amid the stock's run-up, Barra has significantly cut her position in the company. She has exercised options or sold roughly 1.8 million shares this year, valued at more than $73 million, according to public filings confirmed by GM. As of the last public filing in September, Barra still owned more than 433,500 shares valued at over $35 million, with much of her annual awards granted in options and stock.GM's stock performance compares with a 17% yearly increase for Tesla as of Friday's close, a 34% jump for Ford Motor and a 15% loss for Chrysler parent Stellantis. Other U.S.-traded automakers such as Honda Motor and Toyota Motor have had smaller annual gains.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto stocksGM 's most recent quarterly earnings were a major catalyst for Wall Street analyst bullishness that led to reratings and price target increases after the third quarter.The automaker's quarterly adjusted earnings per share have topped Wall Street estimates every quarter except the second quarter of 2022 over the past five years, according to average expectations of analysts compiled by FactSet. Wall Street analysts overall have cited GM's cash generation, earnings resilience and track record in delivering shareholder returns, including stock buybacks, as reasons for their optimism. The automaker also is expected to greatly benefit from regulation changes under the Trump administration, despite ongoing tariffs. UBS recently increased its 12-month price target on GM stock by 14% to $97 per share, while naming the company its top autos pick heading into 2026. Morgan Stanley earlier this month also upgraded GM to overweight, with a $90 per share price target.\"In our view, General Motors leads the D3 in the North America and Global market with steady unit sales growth, [average transaction price] growth, disciplined incentive spend, and inventory management. This has resulted in better [earnings before interest and taxes] margin and return metrics than peers,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco said in a Dec. 7 investor note.Read moreGM stock has cumulatively been in the black on a weekly basis since June. The largest weekly gain of 19.3% occurred when the automaker reported its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. Those results beat Wall Street's expectations and the company raised its annual guidance, adding that next year's earnings are expected to be better than 2025's.GM stock's has also seen a boost from some external factors. The Trump administration has loosened U.S. fuel economy and emissions standards, removed related penalties that were imposed under the Biden administration, and renegotiated its trade deal with South Korea, a major manufacturing hub for GM. Meanwhile, the industry has been seeing a slowdown in less profitable EV sales.\"GM is effectively a regional (NA) [automaker] and we believe they are well positioned to benefit from the relaxed US regulatory environment (emissions and fuel economy),\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a Dec. 15 investor note raising the per share price.GM CFO Paul Jacobson earlier this month said the company will continue stock buybacks.\"As long as the stock remains as undervalued as it is, the priority is to buy back shares. And I think you'll continue to see that from us going forward,\" he said during a UBS investor conference.GM is rated overweight with an $80.86 target price, according to analyst averages compiled by FactSet.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Correction: Lucid shares are down for the year.

    "body": "watch nowDemocrat Rep. Ro Khanna has embraced a wealth tax in his home state of California, and his longtime allies in Silicon Valley are now threatening to abandon him. California labor groups are trying to add a proposal for a statewide tax on billionaires to the November ballot. The proposal is causing a rift among Democrats and enraging some in the tech community, who warn they will leave the state if the measure is adopted. Khanna last week reacted to the potential exodus in a social media post, saying he echoes what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said with \"sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, 'I will miss them very much.'\"The post prompted not only criticism from tech leaders but also calls for Khanna to be primaried. \"Ro has done a speed run alienating every moderate I know who has supported him. Including myself,\" wrote Martin Casado, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, in a post on X. \"At least that makes voting him the f--- out all the more gratifying.\"  Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationGarry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote it's \"Time to primary him.\"Associates of Andreessen Horowitz and Y Combinator are among the top donors to Khanna's congressional campaign committee, according to recent campaign finance disclosures.The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget. Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. A major reason that tech investors, executives and entrepreneurs are united in vocal opposition is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means that startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid. \"We're absolutely going to have to figure out how our society adapts to a rapidly increasing wealth gap,\" wrote Reddit co-founder and venture investor Alexis Ohanian, in a post on Sunday. \"But the answer is definitely not taxing unrealized gains.\"Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in a statement that the congressman is a \"passionate supporter of technology and entrepreneurship,\" noting that he co-wrote the CHIPS and Science Act, a federal program designed to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.Drory said that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"California Governor Gavin Newsom attends the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30), in Belem, Brazil, Nov. 11, 2025. Adriano Machado | ReutersDemocratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is widely considered a contender for the presidency in 2028, opposes state-level billionaire taxes.\"You can't isolate yourself from the 49 [other states],\" Newsom said at the New York Times Dealbook conference earlier this month. \"You've gotta be pragmatic about it.\"But pressure is growing nationally for Democrats to back efforts to tax the wealthy, as polls repeatedly show wide support for the idea. A Pew Research Center poll earlier this year found that 58% of those surveyed support raising taxes on those making more than $400,000. Among the Democrats surveyed, 74% supported the higher taxes. Republicans, meanwhile, have been making increasing inroads in Silicon Valley, home to a number of tech billionaires who have traditionally leaned Democratic. Tech CEOs this year have flocked to the White House to curry the favor of President Donald Trump, who has placed tech leaders in roles within his administration. Khanna carried California's 17th Congressional District by more than 30 points in 2024. The deep-blue seat would be highly unlikely to flip to Republicans in 2026. In a follow-up post on X, Khanna restated his support for a wealth tax. \"Yes, we need entrepreneurs to commercialize disruptive innovation,\" Khanna said. \"But the idea that they would not start companies to make billions, or take advantage of an innovation cluster, if there is a 1-2 percent tax on their staggering wealth defies common sense and economic theory.\"Vinod Khosla, the founder of Sun Microsystems and Khosla Ventures who boasts a net worth of about $12.6 billion according to Forbes, disagreed with Khanna and said the billionaires will leave the state. \"You are so wrong Ro,\" Khosla said in a post on X. \"Top prospects for generating wealth in the state will almost certainly leave the state. Every advisor would advise every enterprise that gets big momentum to have key people relocate to another state.\" WATCH: Investors underestimating the AI revolution, analyst sayswatch now",

    "body": "The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.Market pros say this age group — dubbed the \"Grey Pound\" or \"Silver Spenders\" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new \"idle rich.\"Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.\"Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,\" Coatsworth told CNBC.\"Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,\" he added.Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.Compounding assetsAlyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.Day-to-day life for \"a lot of\" them is still \"quite tough and normal,\" but there are others who are \"just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,\" he said.This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods \"that they've never had before,\" as well as for \"higher-end\" wealth management and insurance services.These customers are increasingly seeking out \"content, story, getting involved, a purpose\" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHiscox.He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.\"The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,\" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. \"I expect you'll see a few of those.\"Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the \"Silver Pound.\"He said people living their \"Saga years,\" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a \"materially undervalued\" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.'The list goes on'Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.\"Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,\" Coatsworth said of the cohort. \"The list goes on.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPets At Home.Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.\"Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,\" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.",

However, he urged the country to negotiate.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said, standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\"I heard Iran wants to make a deal. If they want to make a deal that's much smarter,\" the president continued.Trump gaggled with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida ahead of a meeting there with Netanyahu, which comes at a fraught time for the Middle East and amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. NBC News reported earlier this month that Netanyahu and Israeli officials were becoming more concerned that Iran was attempting to ramp up its ballistic missile production — which had been damaged earlier this year by Israeli strikes — and reconstitute the nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June.\"If they will continue with the missiles, yes.

The first phase of the agreement took effect in October and has mostly held. But a second phase — which would call on Hamas to disarm and require Israeli military forces to withdraw — has proven more challenging. Netanyahu has said the second phase cannot begin until Hamas returns the remains of the final deceased Israeli hostage. Trump said on Monday that he hopes to proceed to the second phase \"as quickly as we can. But there has to be a disarmament ... we have to disarm with Hamas.\"Foreign policy in focusForeign policy has dominated Trump's schedule of late. On Sunday, he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago. The Trump administration is facilitating negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the multiyear conflict between the two nations. During the meeting, Zelenskyy reportedly had asked the U.S. for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, though the current 20-point peace plan outlined guarantees for 15 years.Trump also said he had a \"very productive\" call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, though he said a few \"thorny issues\" stand in the way of ending the war.\"We have a couple of issues that we're going to get resolved, hopefully, and if we get it resolved, you're going to have peace,\" Trump said.In the short, wide-ranging press conference on Monday, Trump offered updates on his monthslong pressure campaign against Venezuela.The president confirmed a U.S. strike on a drug loading facility in Venezuela, marking an escalation in his campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs .... So we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area,\" Trump said. \"It's the implementation area, that's where they implement, and that is no longer around.\"Trump has recently designated the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.",

The $55 billion deal, which includes $20 billion in debt financing, is the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history.The move could have major implications for EA, according to Omdia analysts. They said the question now is whether the PIF plans to run EA as a \"PR project\" or \"to extract maximum returns\" from the company. French game developer Ubisoft looked to turn its fortunes around this year, although it started 2025 with a second delay to the latest entry in its flagship Assassin's Creed series, Shadows.Ubisoft's shares received a boost in March after announcing the creation of a new gaming subsidiary with Chinese tech giant Tencent called Vantage Studios. The new developer, which will be part-owned by Tencent, will focus on Ubisoft's key IP — Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.watch nowDespite Ubisoft's efforts, shares have lost just over half of their value year to date, and the stock is down over 90% from its 2021 high.In contrast, Take-Two Interactive's shares continued to climb throughout 2025, as anticipation mounted for the next Grand Theft Auto title. It's been 12 years since the previous edition, GTA 5, was released on Xbox 360 and PS3.However, with radio silence on GTA 6 for most of the year, fans speculated that an additional delay from the May 26, 2026, release date was on the cards, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick telling CNBC in May that he had a \"very, very high conviction\" the scheduled date would be achievable. In November this year, the game was pushed back to Nov. 19, 2026, with shares in Take-Two tumbling on the news.The game will launch in the twilight window for Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S — six years after both consoles were released. As focus shifts to the next generation of consoles, this past generation has seen a change in strategy for both brands. Console strategies shiftXbox has moved away from exclusive games, with titles such as Indiana Jones, Forza Horizon, and more releasing on PS5, while PlayStation continues to experiment further with releasing titles on PC. Take-Two's Zelnick argued that the shifting strategies will see the video game industry become more open. When asked whether the console will be in business within the next five to 10 years, he said the consoles will still be around, with the devices moving towards PC as \"business is moving towards open rather than closed.\"\"But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours, that you play on a big screen, that's never going away,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in November.Consoles still have a huge role to play in the market, according to George Jijiashvili, senior principal analyst for Games at Omdia. He told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the devices are still \"the go-to place for premium games.\"Data from Omdia shows that consoles are the second-largest category when it comes to total consumer spend, with mobile spend contributing 60%, consoles reaching 23%, and PCs hitting 16%. While others mostly abandoned exclusive titles, Nintendo has continued to pursue the strategy, releasing several exclusive titles for its new Switch 2 console – including an open-world reimaging of Mario Kart and a brand-new Donkey Kong game. This summer, Switch 2 became the fastest-selling console in history, selling 10.36 million units in the first four months of sales.Not all are convinced by Nintendo's strategy. Christopher Dring, founder and editor-in-chief of The Game Business, told CNBC's \"Built for Billions\" in November that Nintendo faces a challenge in maintaining demand for its systems.\"Unlike PlayStation and Xbox and other platforms, the people buying Nintendo machines are buying it for Nintendo games. What that means is, if they don't have a game ready, they can not rely on other developers to prop them up.\"",

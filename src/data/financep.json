    "body": "The Lucid display is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCLucid Group is targeting a new goal that would make it the first automaker to offer highly advanced self-driving capabilities in its vehicles in the coming years, the company said Tuesday.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer expects to launch what it's calling \"mind-off\" driving in which a car can essentially drive itself under normal circumstances without a human needing to monitor it or intervene unless there's a change in circumstances, such as severe weather. That would be like an occupant playing a game of cards or watching TV while the car is driving.Lucid on Tuesday said it plans to leverage Nvidia's \"Drive AV\" platform and multisensor suite that includes cameras, radar, and lidar — or light detection and sensing, which allows the vehicle to better \"see\" its surroundings — for the forthcoming system.Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, said the plan is to debut the new system \"definitely in the coming years,\" but he declined to specify an exact timeframe other than it won't be in 2026. The system is first planned for Lucid's upcoming midsize vehicle before it would expand to other models, he said.\"I want to make sure that we can offer this for our customers in a timeframe that I think is very ambitious, but at the same time, also we're realistic,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"The main reason why I decided to not start from scratch, just do it ourselves, it's simply time to market. … Also, it would cost a lot of money.\"Winterhoff said Nvidia's technologies will be a catalyst for the system, while Lucid plans to actually execute the self-driving technology.In the meantime, Winterhoff said Lucid plans to continue to increase the automated technologies on its current vehicles — the Air sedan and Gravity SUV — in partnership with Nvidia.A Lucid-supplied teaser image of its upcoming midsize vehicle behind its current Gravity SUV.Lucid\"It will be a stepping stone,\" said Winterhoff, who has served as interim CEO since company founder Peter Rawlinson left as chief executive in February.Many companies, including General Motors and Tesla, have promised personal self-driving vehicles but have failed to deliver. Automakers have invested billions of dollars working on autonomous vehicles in recent years, with most pulling back spending after years of trying to deploy the technologies.What Lucid is aiming to launch is what the industry refers to as \"Level 4: High Driving Automation.\" As defined by SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 4 technologies should not require monitoring or human intervention under certain, but not all, conditions.There are a limited number of Level 4 vehicles currently on U.S. roadways. Most notably, Alphabet's Waymo operates robotaxis in a variety of cities. Lucid is saying it plans to be the first for a consumer vehicle.Achieving such a system for Lucid will be daunting, especially given its track record on advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS.The company, by its own admission, has not lived up to its customers' expectations. It has been slow to release systems capable of hands-free driving, like many companies offer, or compete with well-known \"Level 2\" technologies such as GM's \"Super Cruise\" or Tesla's \"Autopilot\" or \"FSD.\"Meanwhile, it's set to be a record year for EV sales, but demand for all-electric cars is expected to decline with the end of federal incentives of up to $7,500. Lucid announced the self-driving technology plans as well as other initiatives in conjunction with the Nvidia GTC global artificial intelligence conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C.",

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, who wrote a book in 2021 titled, \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" now says leaders need to shift their approach to climate change.In a letter published Tuesday ahead of next week's COP30 U.N. climate summit, Gates argued that too many resources are focused on emissions and the environment, and that more money should go toward \"improving lives\" and curbing disease and poverty.\"Climate is super important but has to be considered in terms of overall human welfare,\" Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive interview. \"I didn't pick that position because everybody agrees with it – it's I think intellectually the right answer.\"In the letter, Gates called out the \"doomsday view\" of climate change and said leaders need to make a \"strategic pivot\" to focus on issues that have the \"greatest impact on human welfare.\"\"It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into,\" he wrote.Breakthrough Energy, Gates' climate-focused investment fund, reportedly cut dozens of staffers earlier this year. The New York Times reported in March that the \"change shows how Mr. Gates is retooling his empire for the Trump era.\"This year's climate summit in Brazil comes nearly a decade after world leaders adopted the Paris climate agreement aimed at limiting temperature warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.Gates called that original goal unrealistic.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOver the last decade, the U.S. government has stepped in and out of the commitment depending on who's in the White House.The U.S. initially entered the agreement under President Barack Obama, before President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact when he took office for the first time in 2017. After President Joe Biden rejoined, Trump issued an executive order to again withdraw during his second term.Gates said in 2017 that he was \"deeply concerned\" but \"hopeful\" that the U.S. would continue supporting innovation after Trump left the agreement.Gates told Sorkin that pulling back on climate initiatives is a \"huge disappointment,\" but credited companies like Microsoft for investing in alternative energy technologies. Continued support of these innovations will bring down costs, he said.Over the last decade, several major technology companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have set 2030 targets to reach net-zero emissions or go carbon negative.In February, Microsoft sustainability chief Melanie Nakagawa admitted that the \"moon has gotten further away\" from previous goals as the company doubles down on artificial intelligence.\"However, the force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster, and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence (AI),\" she wrote.The massive energy demand needed to meet growing data center power requirements has sparked concerns among many climate activists.In terms of AI and concerns that a bubble has formed, Gates said many investments will be \"dead ends.\"Still, he added, \"If you want to be a tech company you don't get to say no let's check out of this race.\"",

Nathan Howard | ReutersU.S. air traffic controllers Tuesday missed their first full paychecks since the government shutdown began at the start of the month, while the Department of Transportation said flight delays due to staffing shortages have increased.The controllers are facing increased financial stress and it's getting harder to recruit much-needed workers, union officials and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday. Air traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the employees required to work during the shutdown as essential employees, even though they're not getting regular paychecks.\"The problems are mounting daily,\" said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, at a news conference at New York's LaGuardia Airport.The Federal Aviation Administration warned about staffing shortages at airports serving Philadelphia, Denver and airspace over a large swath of the Western U.S. that could disrupt flights on Tuesday.Duffy told reporters that 44% of the flight delays on Sunday, and about 24% of them on Monday, were due to air traffic controller staffing, compared with around 5% of the delays so far this year.U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy holds a press conference on the impact of the government shutdown on air travel, at LaGuardia Airport in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersDuffy also said that the shutdown is hurting government air traffic training and recruiting, and that some funds for trainee stipends are \"about to run out.\"Air traffic controller union officials have said that some members have been driving for ride-hailing platforms and taking other jobs to make ends meet.Members of the union, including its president, plan to hand out leaflets and speak to the public at several airports across the U.S. on Tuesday, urging travelers to push Congress to end the shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom.

    "body": "Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference for Eli Lilly and Company in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly and Nvidia are partnering to build what they call the pharmaceutical industry's \"most powerful\" supercomputer and so-called AI factory to help accelerate drug discovery and development across the sector, the companies announced Tuesday. It's the latest stride by Nvidia and the pharmaceutical industry to harness AI to help shorten the time it takes to bring cures to patients, while reducing costs at every stage of drug discovery and development. The process typically takes about 10 years on average from dosing the first human with a drug to its launch on the market, said Diogo Rau, Eli Lilly's chief information and digital officer, in an interview. Eli Lilly expects to complete the buildout of the supercomputer and AI factory in December. They will go online in January. But the new tools likely won't yield significant returns for the company's business and that of any other drugmaker until the end of the decade. \"The things that we're talking about discovering with this kind of power that we have right now, we're really going to see those benefits in 2030,\" Rau said. The industry's efforts to use AI to bring medicines to people faster are still in the early stages. There are no drugs on the market designed using AI, but progress is evident in the number of AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials, recent AI-focused investments and partnerships among drugmakers.Eli Lilly will own and operate the supercomputer, which will be powered by more than 1,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs – a newer family of chips from Nvidia – connected on a unified, high-speed network. The supercomputer will power the AI factory, a specialized computing infrastructure that will develop, train and deploy AI models at scale for drug discovery and development.The supercomputer \"is really a novel scientific instrument. It's like an enormous microscope for biologists,\" said Eli Lilly's Chief AI Officer Thomas Fuchs. \"It really allows us to do things we couldn't do before at that enormous scale. Scientists will be able to train AI models on millions of experiments to test potential medicines, \"dramatically expanding the scope and sophistication\" of drug discovery, according to a release from Eli Lilly. While finding new drugs isn't the only focus of the new tools, it is \"where the big opportunity is,\" said Rau.\"We're hopeful that we'll be able to discover new molecules that we never would have with humans alone,\" he said. Several AI models will be available on Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform that allows biotech companies to access drug discovery models that Eli Lilly has trained on years of its proprietary research. That data is worth $1 billion.Eli Lilly launched that platform in September as a way to expand access to drug discovery tools across the sector. \"It's really powerful to be able to give that extra starting point to these startups that, you know, otherwise could take a couple of years burning their capital to get to that point,\" said Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, adding that the company is \"delighted to participate\" in that effort. In exchange for access to the AI models, biotech companies are expected to contribute some of their own research and data to help train them, Rau noted. The TuneLab platform employs so-called federated learning, which means that companies can take advantage of Lilly's AI models without either side directly sharing data.Eli Lilly also plans to use the supercomputer to shorten drug development and help get treatments to people faster. The company said new scientific AI agents can support researchers, and advanced medical imaging can give scientists a clearer view of how diseases progress and help them develop new biomarkers — a measurable sign of a biological process or condition — for personalized care. \"We would actually like to deliver on that promise of precision medicine,\" Powell said. \"Without an AI infrastructure and foundation, we'll never get there, right? So we're doing all of the necessary building, and now we're seeing this true lift off, and Lilly is an exact example of that.\"Precision medicine is an approach that tailors disease prevention and treatment according to differences in a person's genes, environments, and lifestyles.",

    "body": "A woman holds a sign reading \"Protect SNAP,\" as food aid benefits will be suspended starting November 1 amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, during \"A Rally for SNAP\" on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., October 28, 2025.   Brian Snyder | ReutersA group of more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to maintain funding of so-called SNAP benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown.The suit was filed four days after the Trump administration said it would not use $6 billion in Congressionally-appropriated emergency funding to maintain benefits during the shutdown from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which blames Senate Democrats for not ending the shutdown, has said that SNAP benefits will cease on Saturday, the lawsuit noted.\"Because of USDA's actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program's inception,\" the suit says.\"Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,\" the states said in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, one of the states in the case, at a press conference accused the Trump administration of \"playing fast and loose with people eating. Can you imagine that?\"\"The money is there! Let us not let them get away with saying that they can't do it,\" DeLauro said. \"Their political will isn't there to feed the people who rely on the SNAP program, which is the most effective anti-hunger program in the United States of America.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteNew York State Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on the suit, said, \"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide.\"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,\" James said. \"There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"A USDA spokesperson, asked for comment on the suit, said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"\"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, in an interview on Tuesday on Fox News shortly after the suit was filed, was asked if funding for SNAP had \"truly run dry.\"\"100% unequivocally, USDA does not have the $9.2 billion that it would require,\" Rollins answered.\"There's not just pots of $9.2 billion sitting around. And what's particularly rich about New York saying that, or California, or any of these other blue states that have filed the lawsuit to say, 'Oh no, we're going to go, you guys, USDA, go find the money,' \" Rollins said.\"It's their very friends, partners, colleagues, Democrat elected officials, that continue to vote over and over again to keep the government closed,\" Rollins said.\"Again, shame on them. I cannot begin to understand what they're thinking.\"There is no current end in sight for the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.On Tuesday, a Republican-backed House bill that would fund the government temporarily failed to win approval in the Senate for the 13th time.Nearly all Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the Republican bill because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.The enhanced tax credits currently used by about 20 million Americans to reduce the cost of health plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces are due to expire at the end of the year.",

    "body": "A UPS worker pushes a cart in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 27, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUnited Parcel Service on Tuesday reported earnings that topped Wall Street's estimates ahead of its busy holiday season and revealed deeper job cuts as part of its sweeping turnaround plan.The company said Tuesday it's reduced its operational workforce by 34,000 jobs this year, greater than its previous estimate of 20,000 reductions. The company also trimmed 14,000 jobs from its management workforce.UPS told CNBC in a statement those cuts have already taken place.Shares of the package delivery giant rose 8% on Tuesday.Here's how the company performed in its third quarter, compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.74 adjusted vs. $1.30 expectedRevenue: $21.4 billion vs. $20.83 billion expectedFor the period ended Sept. 30, the company reported net income of $1.31 billion, or $1.55 per share, compared with $1.99 billion, or $1.80 per share, the year prior. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs of its transformation strategy, the company reported profit of $1.48 billion or $1.74 per share. Revenue fell to $21.4 billion.UPS estimates its fourth-quarter revenue to be $24 billion with an operating margin of 11% to 11.5%.Much of its workforce reductions have been tied to trimming down its work with Amazon, previously its largest customer.In the third quarter, Amazon's total volume with UPS fell 21.2%, executives said on an earnings call, compared with a 13% decline for the first half of the year.UPS also initiated a sale-leaseback transaction in the third quarter for five properties as part of its broader strategy, which resulted in $330 million of what the company described as a pretax gain on sale in its supply chain solutions division. It said Tuesday that it has now closed daily operations at 93 leased and owned buildings through September as part of the initiative.UPS said its turnaround plan has resulted in $2.2 billion in savings through the end of the third quarter, with an estimate of achieving $3.5 billion total year-over-year cost savings in 2025.\"We are executing the most significant strategic shift in our company's history, and the changes we are implementing are designed to deliver long-term value for all stakeholders,\" CEO Carol Tomé said. \"With the holiday shipping season nearly upon us, we are positioned to run the most efficient peak in our history while providing industry-leading service to our customers for the eighth consecutive year.\"The courier's strong results come as the parcel industry faces a volatile tariff environment and sluggish demand, in addition to impacts from the end of the de minimis loophole. Rival FedEx said last month that it incurred $150 million in headwinds from the global trade environment.\"The third quarter brought a wave of tariff changes, some expected, others unforeseen, and our team navigated these complexities with exceptional skills and resilience,\" Tomé said on the call, adding that the company is incorporating artificial intelligence into its daily operations to adapt to the surge in customs entries.",

Aaron Schartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood on Tuesday pushed back on fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, while flagging the possibility of a \"reality check\" on AI valuations.Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative, or FII, in Riyadh, Wood said that as interest rates begin to rise, \"there will be a shudder\" in markets.\"We are going to reach a moment in the next year where the conversation will shift from lower interest rates to rising rates,\" the closely watched investor said.\"There are a lot of people out there ... who think that innovation and interest rates are inversely correlated. That is not true over history,\" Wood said.\"I want to disabuse people of that notion. But nonetheless, the way algorithms work these days, we think there will be a reality check, shall we say.\"Her comments come amid concerns of soaring tech valuations as both businesses and investors pour money into the sector.watch nowWood is one of many business leaders to have waded into the AI bubble debate, particularly as AI-driven spending has led to record deals and valuations.Earlier in the month, the International Monetary Fund and Bank of England became the latest financial institutions to warn that global stock markets could be in trouble if investor appetite for artificial intelligence turns sour.IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva offered some blunt advice to investors at the time, \"Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.\"She joined the likes of OpenAI's Sam Altman, JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in warning about the risk of a stock market correction as AI spending surges.Wood: AI is not in a bubbleArk Invest's Wood said Big Tech valuations will make sense in the longer term, however.\"I'm not saying there will never be any corrections. Of course there will, as many people worry: 'OK, is this too much, too soon?' But if our expectations for AI, especially embodied AI in the way that I just described, are correct, we are at the very beginning of a technology revolution,\" Wood said.Asked whether AI was in a bubble right now, Wood replied: \"I do not believe AI is in a bubble. What I do think is, on the enterprise side, it is going to take a while for large corporations to prepare themselves to transform.\"She added: \"It's going to take a company like Palantir going into the largest enterprises and really restructuring them in order to really capitalize on the productivity gains that we think are going to be unleashed by AI.\"Global markets rallied at the start of this week, with investors buoyed by hopes that the U.S. and China could soon reach an agreement on trade. U.S. stocks jumped to fresh records on Monday with Asian markets also seeing solid gains.Investors are closely watching a number of key market catalysts, including Big Tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to cut rates for the second time this year.",

The tools will be available starting Tuesday through several of Palo Alto's current cloud services, and will launch as a separate platform next year.The new AI agents are meant to meet growing demand from customers for more automated capabilities, CEO Nikesh Arora told reporters and analysts last week. Most agents, he added, will have a human middleman to review.In the age of AI, companies are racing to find new methods to fight increasingly sophisticated and complex cyberattacks. Earlier this month, cybersecurity firm F5's stock dropped 10% after it said it suffered a nation-state hack.Arora said he's concerned that some enterprises are still \"under the illusion that they are extremely secure.\"Palo Alto Networks is in the midst of a watershed shake-up as it integrates its $25 billion acquisition of Israeli identity security vendor CyberArk.Shortly after the news broke, Arora told CNBC that the deal integrates CyberArk with Palo Alto's AI and security aspirations.\"We look for great products, a team that can execute in the product, and we let them run it,\" he said.WATCH: AI is changing the world, cybersecurity has to keep up, says Palo Alto Networkswatch now",

    "body": "Homes in the south suburban Chicago area on April 26, 2023.Brian Cassella | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesA home is most Americans' single largest investment. The returns are losing ground.Home prices nationally rose 1.5% in August compared with the same month last year, down from the 1.6% annual gain recorded in July, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index.While home prices aren't yet falling, they're weakening — rising at a slower pace than the current 3% rate of inflation. That means that housing wealth eroded in real terms for the fourth consecutive month, according to the index.Home prices in nearly all of the metropolitan markets highlighted in the index fell month to month in August. Only Chicago saw price gains. Home prices are seasonal and usually drop this time of year, but this weakness was more significant than typical seasonal patterns.Much of that is due to stubbornly high mortgage rates, which stagnated over the summer, when much of this index was measured. (The index is a three-month running average.) Rates have since declined, but not by a lot. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage started June at just below 7% and fell to 6.5% by the end of August, according to Mortgage News Daily. It is now at 6.19%.\"Mortgage rates remaining above 6.5% continue to weigh on buyer demand, even during what should be the busy summer season. The combination of high financing costs and prices that remain near record highs has limited transaction activity,\" wrote Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a news release.August prices rose the most in the New York metropolitan area, with a 6.1% annual gain, followed by Chicago at 5.9% and Cleveland at 4.7%. On the flip side, prices in Tampa, Florida, fell 3.3% year over year, Phoenix dropped 1.7% and Miami declined 1.7%.There was also weakness in the West, with prices in San Francisco down 1.5%, Denver fell  0.7% and San Diego dropped 0.7%. Seattle also turned very slightly negative.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Markets that experienced the sharpest pandemic-era gains are now seeing the largest corrections, while more affordable metros with stable local economies are holding up better,\" Godec said. \"This adjustment may ultimately lead to a more sustainable market, but for now, homeowners are watching their real equity erode while buyers face the dual challenge of elevated prices and high borrowing costs.\"A separate survey from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, that measures prices of homes with conforming loans showed house prices rose 2.3% in August year over year and 0.4% from July.\"This relative strength on a month-on-month basis reverses the recent weak trend and shows some stabilization in home prices across the US after several months of month-on-month declines,\" said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James, in a statement. \"We may see some more stability in home price appreciation during the rest of the year as the effects of lower mortgage interest rates support increased housing activity.\"",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco on June 2, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday announced it has completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.The artificial intelligence startup said its nonprofit is now called the OpenAI Foundation, and it holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm. OpenAI said its for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.Under the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will hold a 26% stake in the for-profit, with 47% held by current and former employees and investors.Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company as early as 2019, said it supports OpenAI's recapitalization and now holds an investment in the PBC that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.The company said it previously held a 32.5% stake in the for-profit on an as-converted basis, excluding OpenAI's recent funding rounds.Microsoft shares closed up 1.98% on Tuesday.\"The more OpenAI succeeds as a company, the more the non-profit's equity stake will be worth, which the non-profit will use to fund its philanthropic work,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion.In 2024, the company announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. But after facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said in May that its nonprofit would retain control.The OpenAI Foundation will make an initial $25 billion commitment to work to accelerate health breakthroughs and technical solutions to AI resilience, OpenAI said Tuesday.As part of the announcement, Microsoft said OpenAI has agreed to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, though Microsoft will no longer have a first right of refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider.The companies also outlined several additional changes to their partnership.When OpenAI says it has reached Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, which is a term for an AI system that rivals or exceeds human intelligence, that claim will have to be verified by an independent expert panel, Microsoft said. The revenue share agreement between the two companies will remain until that panel verifies AGI.Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties.OpenAI remains Microsoft's frontier model partner. Microsoft said its IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032, and include models post-AGI. OpenAI's consumer hardware is excluded from Microsoft's IP rights.\"As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business,\" Microsoft said in a statement.Microsoft is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 results after market close on Wednesday.WATCH: OpenAI begins to threaten software stockswatch now",

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe easy part for the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will be announcing an interest rate cut when it wraps up its two-day policy meeting. The hard part will be taking care of other details that are presenting substantial challenges to policymaking these days.Markets are assigning a nearly 100% probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a second consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, reduction in the federal funds rate. The overnight lending benchmark is currently targeted between 4%-4.25%.Beyond that, policymakers are likely to debate, among other things, the future path of reductions, the challenges posed by a lack of economic data and the timetable for ending the reduction in its asset portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Underlining all of those deliberations will be a growing divergence of opinion over what the future holds for monetary policy.\"They are at a moment in the policy cycle where there's genuine disagreement between people who are thinking we will probably cut rates but I'm not ready to cut again just yet, and people who think even though there's risks, it's time to do more now,\" said Bill English, a Yale professor and the Fed's former director of monetary affairs. \"There's dissent between people who want to cut now, and people who want to wait and see a bit more.\"watch nowJudging by recent statements and prevailing Wall Street sentiment, newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran is likely to dissent in favor of a bigger cut, as he did at the September FOMC meeting.At the same time, regional Presidents Beth Hammack of Cleveland, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Jeffrey Schmid of St. Louis have expressed reluctance to go much further on cuts, though it's far from clear whether they will vote against a cut this week. Only Miran, who wanted a half-point reduction, actually dissented in what was an 11-1 committee vote last month to cut by a quarter point.Left to try to straddle the difference will be Chair Jerome Powell, who in a recent speech gave an implied nod to an October cut when he expressed worry over the state of the labor market.Investors will look to the central bank chief, who will leave the position in May 2026, for guidance on the prevailing sentiment.\"I would expect him to try to walk a middle ground, not tip his hand necessarily, on December,\" English said, referring to the next policy meeting after this one. \"I don't think he wants to be locked into a rate cut in December. But on the other hand, it does seem like he's worried about the labor market and about the outlook for real activity, so he doesn't want to come across as hawkish.\"Markets currently also are pricing in a near-certainty of a December reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, so it would take a lot do dissuade Wall Street from anticipating more Fed easing.Worries about jobsOne big reason officials are in the mood to lower is concern over the labor market. Even with an absence of data, there are clear signs that inflation is slowing even if layoffs, judging by state-level jobless claims submissions that are still ongoing despite the federal shutdown, do not appear to be accelerating.In fact, worries over jobs could keep the Fed cutting well into 2026, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.\"We expect 25 [basis points Wednesday] and then again in December, and then again in January and March and April,\" Tilley said. \"Then that would bring them down to what we think of as the neutral range to 2.75% to 3%.\"watch nowFed officials in September indicated, through the \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations, that they won't get to a rate that neither pushes nor restrains growth — the so-called \"neutral\" rate — until 2027, and even then it will be a quarter point above where Tilley sees.However, he thinks the Fed won't have any choice but to react to labor market weakness, particularly as it poses a challenge to surprisingly strong economic growth seen in the second half of this year.Worries over jobs have taken more of the Fed's focus even as inflation remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week, in the only official data release during the shutdown, that the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was stuck at 3% in September.Lack of data challengeOutside of the CPI report, central bankers face the additional challenge of the data blackout that has accompanied the government shutdown.\"It's hard to make policy to achieve two goals ... when you're not getting data about about at least one of them,\" Tilley said, referring to the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and keep prices stable, and the absence of the September nonfarm payrolls report due to the shutdown.\"I expect that to be communicated as more uncertainty about the path forward, that they have to be ready to pivot and hold rates, if need be, or to reduce them faster when they finally do get data,\" Tilley said.Finally, markets will be looking for more definitive answers on when the Fed will stop reducing its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, most of which is in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Nicknamed quantitative tightening, or QT, the process has entailed allowing proceeds from maturing securities to roll off rather than being reinvested as usual.In a recent speech, Powell indicated the time is getting closer to where the Fed will want to stop QT. While financial conditions are largely still solid, there have been some small signs lately that short-term markets are tightening up. With the Fed's overnight funding facility nearly drained, officials are likely to signal this week that QT is in its final stages.Market commentary was split over whether the Fed will announce the actual end of the program, or signal a future date when it will cease.\"There are signs that they're getting close to bottom, so to speak, in terms of getting through ample reserves and actually getting some tightness and liquidity. So that's why I would expect an announcement, if not action,\" Tilley said.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPayPal has signed a deal with OpenAI to have its digital wallet embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items found through the leading consumer AI tool, the company told CNBC exclusively.Shares of the company jumped roughly 4% on the news.The agreement, sealed over the weekend, means that starting next year, both sides of PayPal's ecosystem can plug into ChatGPT: PayPal users can purchase items through the AI platform, and its merchants can sell on it, with their inventory listed there, according to PayPal CEO Alex Chriss.\"We've got hundreds of millions of loyal PayPal wallet holders who now will be able to click the 'Buy with PayPal button' on ChatGPT and have a safe and secure checkout experience,\" Chriss said in an interview.The move makes PayPal an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The thinking is that its 700 million-plus weekly users can lean on artificial intelligence to help them find items, similar to a human personal shopper. Last month, OpenAI said its users could buy from Shopify and Etsy merchants, and two weeks ago it announced an e-commerce deal with Walmart.\"It's a whole new paradigm for shopping,\" Chriss said. \"It's hard to imagine that agentic commerce isn't going to be a big part of the future.\"PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the coming era of agentic AI shopping, announcing recent deals with Google and artificial intelligence firm Perplexity. The fintech firm, which also released third-quarter results Tuesday, issued a release on its OpenAI deal after CNBC's report.The company will also manage merchant routing, payment validation and other behind-the-scenes aspects of payment processing for PayPal sellers on ChatGPT, so individual merchants don't have to sign up with OpenAI, the firm said.Chriss touted the fact that both consumers and merchants have been verified by the fintech firm, reducing the risk of fraud for either group. Users can pull funds from linked bank accounts or credit cards, or stored balances, to pay for purchases, and they'll get protections, package tracking and dispute resolution.\"It's not just that a transaction can happen,\" Chriss said. \"It's that this is a trusted set of merchants, the largest merchant network in the world from PayPal, that are verified, with the largest set of verified consumers in a consumer wallet.\"PayPal also said it is expanding the use of OpenAI's enterprise AI products for its employees to speed up product cycles.At the launch last month of its Instant Checkout feature, OpenAI announced it was partnering with Stripe, which is giving users the ability to tap stored card and bank accounts to pay Etsy merchants.Stripe calls its product, Link, a wallet and says it has 200 million users, but the service cannot yet store funds and has no consumer mobile app, so many fintech experts don't yet consider it a full wallet.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company's multiyear effort to rein in costs.In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in \"our biggest bets\" including generative artificial intelligence.\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses.\"The layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. The cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, according to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the matter.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawEmployees in Amazon's cloud, grocery, video games, human resources, sustainability and communications, ads and devices units were informed of cuts early Tuesday morning, although the layoffs are expected to touch nearly every area of the company.Amazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.It has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.The company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\"Amazon's job cuts come as companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing the size of their workforces.Several companies have indicated they can hire fewer employees and still grow their revenues, partly as a result of relying more on AI, which they believe will translate to greater efficiencies and productivity.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company's workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"Meta last week laid off about 600 staffers in its AI unit in an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. Microsoft has cut more than 15,000 staffers this year as CEO Satya Nadella told staffers they must \"reimagine our mission for a new era\" of AI. Google made cuts to a number of units earlier this year and taken steps to reduce bureaucracy by eliminating 35% of managers overseeing small teams.Jassy, who took the helm at Amazon from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years. Amazon laid off 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and job reductions have continued since then, though at a smaller scale.Amazon is slimming down its workforce after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.The company has since moved to shutter some of its unprofitable initiatives, while committing to invest about $118 billion this year in AI development and cloud infrastructure. Amazon faces growing pressure to show its cloud and AI businesses aren't lagging behind rivals.At the same time, Jassy been trying to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the \"world's largest startup\" as it looks to stay competitive. Last September, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, he set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon by the first quarter of this year.Earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to hire 250,000 workers for full-time, part-time and temporary roles in its fulfillment and transportation units to meet demand for the holiday shopping season.Amazon is slated to report its third-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.",

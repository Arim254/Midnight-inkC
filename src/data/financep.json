    "body": "Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., speaks during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, on Friday, June 4, 2021.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlock CEO Jack Dorsey's move to cut nearly half the company's workforce is shining a spotlight on a growing question for corporate America: whether advances in artificial intelligence will ultimately mean fewer workers.In an earnings call Thursday, Dorsey said Block will cut about 4,000 jobs.Dorsey framed the move as more than a cost-cutting exercise, instead describing a shift in how companies operate as artificial intelligence becomes more central to business decisions.He also suggested other companies will follow suit.\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said. \"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.\"Economists, however, question whether such moves signal a broader shift in the labor market or simply reflect company-specific adjustments.\"This is a function of lax judgment during a period of rapid expansion and the retrenchment that follows,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"It should be understood within the unique context of that firm, and it does not signal risk to the broader U.S. labor market.\"Doubts about jobsThe layoffs come amid broader questions about the employment picture.Though job cuts have remained low and the unemployment rate is a relatively healthy 4.3%, openings have contracted sharply and hiring in 2025 largely flatlined, with average payroll growth of just 15,000.Still, the tech-related picture looks relatively healthy.The information sector, one proxy for the tech industry, saw its unemployment rate fall to 5% in January, down 0.7 percentage point from a year ago. Job openings have declined in the sector, but demand for some roles remains firm: Postings in software development are up 12% from a year ago, according to Indeed.Most economists remain sanguine on the labor market, even in the current \"low-hire, low-fire\" environment. Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, said Friday on CNBC that while it is \"healthy\" to discuss AI's potential impact, it is important not to overinterpret individual company decisions.\"I would not extrapolate from Block to the whole U.S. economy,\" Sahm said. \"It's important to understand that these AI tools — the direction you go with them really depends on the leadership. Automation, mass layoffs is not necessarily the only path forward.\"AI's broad impactA widely-discussed speech earlier this week by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller also underscored the challenges and opportunities AI presents.While discussing the Fed's internal use of the technology, Waller said AI is more likely to enhance productivity than eliminate jobs outright.\"When ATMs were first introduced, they didn't eliminate bank tellers. Instead, they changed how banking worked,\" he said. \"The real impact wasn't automation alone — it was how institutions reorganized around technology. AI is similar. The biggest gains won't come from simply adding AI to existing processes. They'll come from rethinking workflows, roles and systems.\"But even if layoffs are not yet widespread — and Dorsey's warnings are not necessarily a broad harbinger — companies are beginning to rethink how they allocate resources.Tech jobs account for only about 5% to 7% of the total labor force, but AI technology itself is spreading far beyond the sector.\"Some jobs are apt to be disrupted by AI\" as companies reconsider the balance between labor and technology, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at Indeed Hiring Lab.\"Companies are really shifting their investments toward capital spending and away from labor,\" Ullrich added. \"They're investing in AI with the hope that it can replace jobs.\"",

Shares of Trump Media swung between gains and losses on Friday after rising in premarket trading. The stock trades under the ticker DJT, which is also President Trump's initials.Such a move will bring more public market attention to Truth Social, the platform where Trump has become known for announcing everything from military strikes to policies like tariffs. Trump even previewed federal economic data ahead of its official release on Truth Social earlier this month.Trump has encouraged his fans to support the app as its parent stock has whipsawed. Shares currently trade at around the $11 mark, well off highs above $100 recorded as recently as 2022.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said in a short statement Friday that a truce had taken effect in southern Ukraine to enable the restoration of the 330-kilovolt supply line to Europe's largest nuclear power plant.\"Demining activities are ongoing to ensure safe access for the repair teams,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on social media.The local ceasefire, which the IAEA said it had helped to secure, comes shortly after the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Russian forces have controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant since the first few weeks of the invasion. Situated in the southeast of the country, the plant is Ukraine's largest and houses six of its 15 operational nuclear power reactors. It has recently been reliant on external power to sustain all essential nuclear safety functions. Both sides have accused each other of raising the risk of a catastrophic accident by staging attacks near to the plant.Russian nuclear power company Rosatom said Friday that IAEA specialists located at the power plant were monitoring repairs to the disconnected power line, according to state news outlet RIA Novosti.Ukraine's Foreign Ministry had not responded to CNBC's request for comment as this article went live.View of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant from right bank of Dnipro river.

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersUBS' top equity strategist dialed back his view on U.S. stocks, citing mounting risks from a weakening dollar, stretched valuations and policy turbulence in Washington.Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at the investment bank, downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\" in a fully invested global equity portfolio, arguing that the factors that powered years of outperformance are starting to fade.The dollar risk is a central concern, Garthwaite wrote. UBS forecasts the euro climbing to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter and sees \"asymmetric structural downside risks\" to the greenback. Historically, when the dollar's trade-weighted index falls 10%, U.S. equities underperform by roughly 4% in unhedged terms, according to the bank. Foreign markets are trouncing the U.S. this year as a weaker dollar and cheaper valuations draw capital overseas. The MSCI World ex-US index has gained about 8% in 2026, compared with the little changed performance for the S&P 500. Japan's Nikkei 225 has rallied 17% year to date, while the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7%, underscoring a sharp rotation away from American equities. U.S. stocks struggled again Friday as investors fretted over the potential downsides of the artificial intelligence build-out and persistent inflation at home.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 year to dateAnother pillar of U.S. stock strength — corporate buybacks — is also losing its edge, the bank said. The buyback yield in the U.S. is now only roughly on par with global peers, eroding what had been a key support for earnings per share growth and investor flows, UBS said. The combined shareholder yield from dividends and buybacks in the U.S. is now about half that of Europe, the bank said.\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" Garthwaite wrote.Valuations add to the unease. UBS calculates that the sector-adjusted price-earnings ratio for U.S. stocks is 35% above international peers, versus an average premium of about 4% since 2010. Roughly 60% of sectors trade not only at higher multiples than their global counterparts but also above their own historical premium, the strategist wrote.Policy volatility under President Donald Trump is another headwind. This year has brought shifts in tariff policy, proposals to cap credit card interest rates, potential limits on private equity investment in housing, renewed scrutiny of drug pricing, and suggestions to curb dividends and buybacks for defense companies, UBS said.Still, the noted strategist stopped short of turning outright bearish. Garthwaite said the U.S. economy and equities tend to benefit more than peers when markets are in the early phases of a potential bubble. The bank also expects artificial intelligence adoption to outpace most other major regions, with the possible exception of China, helping sustain earnings growth across key industries.UBS strategist Sean Simonds set a year-end target of 7,500 for the S&P 500, compared with an average forecast of 7,629 among 14 top strategists, according to CNBC Pro's strategist survey.

I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn't see,\" Clinton said to say.\"I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn't do,\" he planned to say. \"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.\"\"As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing — I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,\" Clinton planned to say. \"But even with 20/20 hindsight, I saw nothing that ever gave me pause.\"Clinton also blasted the committee for forcing his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify about the notorious sex predator Epstein on Thursday. The committee issued subpoenas to both Clintons demanding their testimony, and threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress if they failed to comply.Hillary Clinton says she has told the panel that she neither recalls ever meeting Epstein, or having knowledge of his sexual abuse of young women and underage girls.\"Before we start, I have to get personal,\" Bill Clinton said, according to prepared testimony that his X account posted.\"You made Hillary come in. She had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of even meeting him,\" the former president was set to say. \"She neither traveled with him nor visited any of his properties. Whether you subpoenaed 10 people or 10,000, including her was simply not right.\"The House Oversight Committee has not sought testimony from President Donald Trump about Epstein.The two men were friends for years before falling out in the early 2000s.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal child sex trafficking charges, during Trump's first presidential administration.Epstein killed himself weeks later in a federal jail in New York City.Trump said that millions of documents related to Epstein that were recently released by the Department of Justice exonerated him of any wrongdoing.Trump for months last year opposed the bill in Congress that would force the DOJ to release those files. He dropped his opposition when it became clear Congress would pass that bill, and then he signed it into law in late November.",

    "body": "watch nowWholesale prices rose at a faster-than-expected pace in January, countering hopes that inflation was easing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The core producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8%, more than the 0.6% gain in December and well ahead of the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 0.3%.On an all-items basis, the headline PPI rose 0.5%, also above the forecast for 0.3% and 0.1 percentage point more than the prior month.For the full year, core wholesale prices accelerated 3.6%, while the headline index posted a 2.9% gain. Both figures are well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal and suggest that rising prices are still a factor for the U.S. economy.Stock market futures added to losses following the report. Services prices primarily drove the increase, with a 0.8% monthly rise that was the highest since July 2025. By contrast, goods prices actually fell 0.3%, though core goods prices climbed 0.7%.More than 20% of the increase in services came from margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. On the goods side, energy and food prices both fell while metals prices rose 4.8%.Trade services prices surged 2.5%, helping boost pressures on wholesale inflation.The report comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation has been tamed. Pipeline pressures as indicated by the PPI figures could keep the Fed cautious as it weighs its next moves on interest rates. Markets largely expect the Fed to stay on the sidelines until the summer, though Trump and other White House officials have pushed for lower rates.Economists have worried that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher, though Fed officials largely expect the impact to be temporary. There was some evidence of tariffs in the PPI data, with indexes for apparel and other goods such as intermediate components moving higher.Trump lost a key Supreme Court ruling that overturned his move to use emergency measures to implement the tariffs. However, the president has cited other authorities that will allow him to implement the duties anyway.",

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive refunds of $100 on average, though State Farm says the amount will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in cost savings for customers.That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid $1 billion in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business. Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

She told reporters later that she testified she did not recall ever meeting Epstein, and that she had no knowledge of his crimes.House Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Thursday told reporters that it is \"very possible\" that the panel will subpoena Lutnick to testify.Comer has not called President Donald Trump to testify.Trump, who had a longtime friendship with Epstein before the two men fell out in the early 2000s, has said that the recently released files on Epstein by the DOJ exonerate him of any wrongdoing.MS Now reported earlier this week that the DOJ withheld from public disclosure memos and notes about FBI interviews, including those of a woman who has alleged that Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor.The DOJ, in response to that and other similar reporters, had said, \"If files are temporarily pulled for victim redactions or to redact Personally Identifiable Information, then those documents are promptly  restored online and are publicly available.\"Lutnick, in testimony on Feb. 10, to the Senate Appropriations Committee, admitted that he and his family had lunch with Epstein in December 2012 at Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sits to testify before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing to examine a review of broadband deployment funding at the Department of Commerce, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 10, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersLutnick's testimony came after he had claimed that he cut off contact with his New York City neighbor Epstein in 2005, three years before Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.DOJ files show that Lutnick remained in communication with Epstein years later.MS Now reported on Feb. 10 that, \"In 2015, Lutnick appeared to invite Epstein to an 'intimate' fundraising event for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which Lutnick had been fundraising for at the time.\"\"In 2017, Epstein donated $50,000 to a New York charity in honor of Lutnick, according to the files,\" MS Now reported.Documents also indicate that Epstein and Lutnick \"each signed on behalf of limited liability companies that agreed on Dec. 28, 2012, to acquire stakes in a now-shuttered advertising technology company called Adfin,\" CBS News reported previously.Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersPresident Donald Trump is careening toward the Make America Healthy Again iceberg after issuing an executive order to boost the domestic production of a key herbicide called glyphosate. Democrats see an opportunity to steer the health-conscious movement back to their side. Trump strode into a second term in the White House after former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped his independent bid for president and endorsed him. Kennedy's MAHA movement, which disavows chemicals in food and pushes natural alternatives, played a key part in Trump's victory — and Trump rewarded Kennedy by making him Health and Human Services secretary.But Trump's recent moves that benefit the very chemicals MAHA hates are creating fissures in the base that helped deliver him to the White House, with less than nine months to go until the pivotal midterm elections and primary elections starting next week. Democrats who hope to strip Trump's near-total control of Washington now see an opportunity to claw MAHA back into their fold. \"What the President did in the EO, and sort of saying, you know, 'trust me on this one, we'll get to it later,' has really angered a lot of people,\" Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, the top appropriator on the panel with oversight over the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview with CNBC. \"It does create some huge opportunities for candidates who are willing to talk about the health of our diet, 'food is medicine' [and] toxic chemicals in our environment.\"Pingree is pushing a bill to revoke the executive order on glyphosate with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and has long advocated against chemicals in food. At issue for MAHA is not only last week's executive order to spur glyphosate, the main chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's herbicide Roundup, which has been linked in the past to cancer, but is still deemed safe by the EPA. MAHA advocates say the White House and Republicans have spurned them at multiple turns.The administration has also sided with Bayer-Monsanto in a Supreme Court case that would weaken petitioners' ability to sue if they believe they got cancer from a pesticide or herbicide. And congressional Republicans are pushing a new farm bill with what MAHA advocates argue is a \"liability shield\" for chemical manufacturers. \"This EO is feeling very, very much like the breaking point,\" said Kelly Ryerson, a MAHA advocate who is known by the moniker \"Glyphosate Girl.\" \"People can't continue to make excuses for the administration and saying, 'well, you know, they'll get to it or whatever it is,' because it's just not happening.\"Kelly Ryerson, known by her supporters as \"Glyphosate Girl,\" poses for a portrait, Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026, in Miami.Marta Lavandier | APRyerson said the contingent of MAHA that she sees fleeing the Trump administration is the independents who supported Kennedy and the Democrats who crossed the aisle to support Trump in the hopes that he would make good on Kennedy's health agenda. \"That is a very, very, very real, very large contingent of the group, and very concerning in terms of going into midterms now,\" Ryerson said.  Many in the MAHA movement were initially aligned with Democrats. Some worked to elect former President Barack Obama, making the embrace of Trump especially shocking for Democrats. Republicans have traditionally aligned with chemical manufacturers and big agricultural interests on pesticides and herbicides, supporting the industries' desire for less oversight and regulation.\"I've had conversations with people who are, you know, very engaged in the MAHA movement, who say, 'Are there Democrats who support these things besides you?'\" Pingree said. \"I'm like, holy s---, like how have we missed the boat here? … We have huge numbers of people who will sign on to legislation like this or support these kinds of issues.\" Pingree said she's encouraging her caucus to speak more often on MAHA issues and trying to find them opportunities to engage on the issue.U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) speaks at a press conference hosted by the Climate Action Campaign outside of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025.Bryan Dozier | AFP | Getty ImagesOther Democrats are taking the opportunity to engage, as well. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said in an interview in the Capitol that the administration's move represents an opportunity for Democrats. \"I think the answer is yes, especially given the fact that Kennedy has basically thrown his own people under the bus completely,\" Heinrich said. \"We need to demonstrate that we're actively working on those issues and that we'll do it in a way that will be consistent and predictable.\" \"This whole practice of using glyphosate to desiccate crops before you turn them into Cheerios, that does not play well in New Mexico,\" Heinrich said, noting a particularly hot-button issue for MAHA. And Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat who has been vocal on MAHA and was \"excited\" by RFK's appointment as health secretary, told CNBC in a statement that he has \"always been supportive of getting rid of harmful pesticides in our food to make Americans safer.\"\"RFK Jr. used to feel that way too, and it's incredibly disappointing to see that he and the administration are turning their backs on Americans this way,\" Polis said. \"The President's decision to side with large scale chemical manufacturers ultimately makes Americans less healthy.\"Kennedy has backed the administration's executive order on glyphosate, despite once winning a $290 million case for a man who said he got cancer from the chemical. In a lengthy statement on X this week, he said it is necessary to bring \"chemical production back to the United States and end our near-total reliance on adversarial nations.\" He noted the administration's commitment to regenerative agriculture, which eschews traditional chemical applications in favor of practices that enhance soil health, as one pillar of the strategy.\"If these inputs disappeared overnight, crop yields would fall, food prices would surge, and America would experience a massive loss of farms even beyond what we are witnessing today,\" Kennedy said, blaming Washington for entrenching big ag in chemical use. \"We are now changing course — without destabilizing the food supply.\"U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks to the media following U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 24, 2026. Kylie Cooper | ReutersWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement that the Trump administration has delivered for MAHA on \"removing artificial ingredients from our food supply, overhauling the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, re-examining baby formula, and more.\"\"Democrats long talked about health issues, but President Trump and his Administration have actually delivered – and will continue delivering on the MAHA agenda,\" Desai said. \"The President's executive order to shore up domestic production of elemental phosphorous, which is necessary to manufacture military equipment and other cutting-edge technology, is not going to change our commitment to Make America Healthy Again.\"Ryerson did not say that the MAHA movement was abandoning Trump and Kennedy altogether yet, leaving the door open for a course correction. She also noted Kennedy's role at HHS does not have jurisdiction over pesticides, which are managed by the Environmental Protection Agency.But she warned time is running out for the administration to act.\"There is no evidence at this moment to point to any moves whatsoever to limit these chemical exposures, and the only way I see the White House and Republican Party being able to make up for this in time for midterms is with a very real, very large move to finally do something protective,\" she said. Among those potential moves to appease MAHA would be a ban on pre-harvest desiccation, a process where weed killers are applied to crops before harvest to make harvesting easier. She also urged the administration to revoke its support for Bayer-Monsanto at the Supreme Court and to invest in regenerative agriculture.  It's less clear whether Republicans who have dominated in agricultural districts for years are ready to meet MAHA where it's at. \"They've gone through the science, they'll continue to go through the science on this and we gotta bring it back to the science and the facts and the common sense,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. \"Of course it has to be safe, and that's fine to always look at it, but let's make sure we're dealing with the science.\" \"If you just upended the ability to use it, you would dramatically affect the food supply, and that is the reality,\" Hoeven said.

The startup wants assurance that its technology won't be used for fully autonomous weapons or domestic mass surveillance of Americans, but the DOD hasn't budged. Altman's internal letter on Thursday was meant to show that OpenAI shares Anthropic's boundaries. The Wall Street Journal was first to report the memo.watch nowBefore the Altman memo, OpenAI employees had begun to speak out in support of Anthropic on social media. Some 70 current staffers have signed an open letter titled, \"We Will Not Be Divided,\" which aims to create a \"shared understanding and solidarity in the face of this pressure\" from the department, according to its website.\"For all the differences I have with Anthropic, I mostly trust them as a company, and I think they really do care about safety, and I've been happy that they've been supporting our war fighters,\" Altman told CNBC in an interview Friday. \"I'm not sure where this is going to go.\"OpenAI was awarded a $200 million contract by the DOD last year, which allowed the agency to begin using the startup's models in nonclassified use cases. Anthropic was the first AI lab to integrate its models into mission workflows on classified networks.Altman said he will see if OpenAI can strike a deal with the DOD to deploy its models in classified environments in a way that \"fits with our principles.\" He said the company would build technical safeguards and deploy personnel to \"ensure things are working correctly.\"\"We would ask for the contract to cover any use except those which are unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons,\" Altman wrote. Altman said that OpenAI has had meetings about the topic in recent days, and that the company hasn't yet arrived at a decision on what to do. He said more meetings will take place with OpenAI's safety teams on Friday.\"This is a case where it's important to me that we do the right thing, not the easy thing that looks strong but is disingenuous,\" Altman wrote. \"But I realize it may not \"look good\" for us in the short term, and that there is a lot of nuance and context.\"— CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report.

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowDell shares soared more than 20% on Friday after the company beat fiscal fourth-quarter estimates and issued strong guidance, as a historic memory shortage puts pressure on prices in the sector.Dell reported adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share, exceeding the $3.53 per share expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG. The company posted $33.38 billion in revenue for the quarter, topping a forecast of $31.73 billion.The company estimates fiscal 2027 revenue will come in between $138 billion and $142 billion, blowing away the $124.7 billion expected by Factset.Dell expects revenue for its artificial intelligence servers to hit $50 billion in 2027, more than double the year prior. With memory chip makers prioritizing the high-bandwidth memory needed for AI chips made by companies including Nvidia, AMD and Google, it has meant less supply for the makers of laptops and smartphones.Dell COO Jeff Clarke told analysts on the company's earnings call that Dell is working with memory partners \"to be as flexible and as agile as possible.\"Read more CNBC tech newsEBay laying off about 800 roles, or 6% of its workforceGoogle launches Nano Banana 2, updating its viral AI image generatorNvidia still hasn't sold its U.S.-approved China AI chipsNvidia's Jensen Huang says markets 'got it wrong' on AI threat to software companiesDell started to increase prices for its PCs last year to manage surging costs and CFO David Kennedy said on the earnings call that the company has priced to \"offset\" the pressure from those costs.\"Customers are assessing their needs and priorities in an environment where component demand is outpacing supply, which is elevating input costs and extending lead times,\" Kennedy said.But analysts have raised concerns about those price hikes weighing on demand moving forward.\"While the near term is clearly strong, we are unsure of the demand elasticity created by the swift and significant price actions taken by Dell,\" Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note Thursday.The bank reiterated its buy rating on the stock and upped its price objective from $135 to $155.Earlier this week, shares of competitor PC maker HP Inc. hit a 52-week low after the company reported earnings and noted pressure from increased memory prices.HP CFO Karen Parkhill said on the company's earning call that memory costs have risen roughly 100% sequentially, and the company expects that increase to continue into the fiscal year. Parkhill added that memory costs make up about 35% of its PC's bill of materials, which is double the amount from a year prior.— CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this report.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDell one-day stock chart.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during a dinner event with the company's Taiwanese suppliers in Taipei, Taiwan, on Saturday, Jan. 31, 2026.Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia reported blowout earnings on Wednesday and issued a better-than-expected forecast showing accelerating growth. CEO Jensen Huang proclaimed that \"compute demand is skyrocketing.\" Investor concerns appear to be elsewhere. The stock fell for a second straight day on Friday and is down 6% for the week in what would be its sharpest pullback since November. With the retreat, Nvidia's stock is now down for the year, joining the rest of tech's megacap companies. One broad concern in the market is that capital expenditures among the tech giants will soon peak, meaning Nvidia's growth rates are poised to slow dramatically in the coming quarters and years. Another issue for investors is competition — companies that buy large quantities of chips for AI have begun showing more interest in alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).On Friday, OpenAI, which for years has relied heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train and run AI models, said it would consume 2 gigawatts' worth of Amazon Web Services' Trainium AI chip capacity. That announcement came as OpenAI closed a $110 billion funding round, with Amazon contributing $50 billion and Nvidia putting in $30 billion. \"This is the single biggest validation of Amazon's custom AI silicon strategy to date, and it gives OpenAI a real hedge against Nvidia supply constraints and pricing power,\" Patrick Moorhead, CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, wrote in a post on X.Last month OpenAI committed to adopting 750 megawatts in computing power from smaller AI chipmaker Cerebras. OpenAI is still using plenty of Nvidia. The company said on Friday that it will use 5 gigawatts of computing power on Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. That's on top of existing Nvidia GPUs across the CoreWeave, Microsoft and Oracle clouds.Nvidia on Wednesday said revenue in the January quarter shot up 73% year over year to $68 billion and called for 77% growth in the current quarter, which would be the fastest rate of expansion in a year. But following an expected growth rate of 65% this fiscal year, analysts see that number slowing to 30%, 13% and 14%, respectively, in the subsequent three years. Meta is also exploring Nvidia alternatives. On Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices said the social media company will consume up to 6 gigawatts of its Instinct GPUs. And on Thursday, The Information reported that Meta has struck a multibillion-dollar agreement to use Google's Tensor Processing Units. Broadcom, which builds custom chips for Google, is down 5% for the week. The company is scheduled to report fiscal first-quarter results on Wednesday.With its slide this week, Nvidia is now down 16% for the year, a drop that some analysts see as a buying opportunity. \"We don't know when investors will look at these AI names more positively, but the stock continues to get cheaper and at some point, we do believe there will be a rotation back,\" Jefferies analysts, who recommend buying the shares, wrote in a note on Wednesday.— CNBC's Katie Tarasov and Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: 'A very strong, long-term partnership': OpenAI CEO and Amazon CEO on new strategic partnershipwatch now",

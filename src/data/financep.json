    "body": "Colleen McCarthy was working a corporate job she was never \"super excited about\" when she started creating floral arrangements in her free time.Two years later, she's designed floral arrangements for stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Drew Barrymore through her business Colleen Rose Florals.McCarthy, 27, grew up in Ridgefield, CT. She majored in environmental studies and communications at Fordham University, but after she graduated in 2020, \"it was hard to find a job, period, let alone a job that I really wanted to do,\" she says.She landed a job at a PR agency, but viewed the job as a \"temporary thing\" while she figured out her long-term plan.A couple years into her job, McCarthy says she had a \"mini quarter-life crisis\" about her career. She took a step back to reflect: \"What do I like? What have I always liked? What am I good at?\"McCarthy has always loved flowers — \"I would always be the person in my apartment who would buy flowers from the grocery store and arrange them nicely,\" she says — so when she came across floral design as a potential creative career, she decided to give it a try.In late 2022, McCarthy took an introductory class at Flower School New York, a floral design education institution. Beginner classes currently cost about $175, per their website.\"I remember the instructor came over to me, and she was like, 'Oh, is this your first class?' And I said, yeah. And she was like, 'It doesn't seem like it. You seem to have a natural talent for this,'\" she recalls. Hearing that gave her McCarthy the confidence to seriously pursue floral design, she says. 'I just started telling people I was a florist'While still working her full-time job, McCarthy started buying grocery store flowers each week to practice making her floral designs, and she began sharing her work on Instagram and TikTok and in several local Facebook groups.Social media was \"really huge\" in helping McCarthy grow her business, she says. \"I just started telling people I was a florist, even though I wasn't really that established,\" she says. \"I think just telling myself and telling other people, like, 'Yeah, I'm a florist,' it made it happen more easily.\"McCarthy holding one of her floral designs.Jenna Yandle PhotographyHer first official sale was to a member of one of the Facebook groups in March 2023.\"I was just so excited, just the fact that someone would pay for my work,\" she says. \"That was also really validating.\"In May 2023, McCarthy officially registered Colleen Rose Florals as an LLC – a costly process, she says, but ultimately worth it.\"I don't regret it at all, because then I had all the official stuff done, and then when I really started getting more traction and getting more business, I was happy that I had that,\" she says.McCarthy started working with event planners to design florals for brand events, and even booked her first wedding at the end of 2023.\"After I did that, it also gave me so much more confidence that I could do larger-scale events and figure it out,\" she recalls.Focusing on floralsHalfway through 2024, McCarthy says she started to \"really consider\" quitting her day job.\"There were more and more instances where I was having to turn down flower jobs because of my nine to five,\" she says. \"That was kind of a tipping point, I think, because I was like, 'Wait a second, I would like to be saying yes to these opportunities.'\" In December 2024, McCarthy decided to leave her job to focus on running Colleen Rose Florals.\"I kind of was pretty confident that I would be successful,\" she says. \"I didn't really feel nervous or scared about it. I think maybe my mom was a little more nervous than I was.\"In 2025, the first year she focused on the business full-time, Colleen Rose Florals brought in over $175,000.An arrangement McCarthy designed for a brand event.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyHer main business expense, naturally, is flowers. High-quality blooms are \"really expensive,\" she says, and \"there's a disconnect between what the average consumer thinks flowers cost, and what flowers actually cost.\"McCarthy provides floral arrangements for a variety of occasions, including weddings, brand events, book launches, photoshoots and even concerts.She charges a minimum of $250 for a single \"bespoke\" floral arrangement and typically charges $1,000 or above for smaller events, while small-to-medium weddings can cost between $5,000 and $10,000.Starting in the spring of 2024, Madison Square Garden began commissioning floral arrangements from McCarthy to decorate artists' dressing rooms. This year, she's provided bouquets for the dressing rooms of stars like Katy Perry, Lainey Wilson, Haim and Renee Rapp.One of her most exciting moments was being asked to create a bouquet for Sabrina Carpenter in October.\"That was so exciting and validating, that someone felt confident enough in me to order my work for a huge artist,\" she recalls.A floral arrangement that McCarthy designed for Sabrina Carpenter's dressing room at Madison Square Garden.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyLooking aheadRight now, Colleen Rose Florals is a solo operation, though McCarthy sometimes hires freelancers to help out with large events.Every day running her floral business is \"super different,\" she says, but she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. to buy flowers from Manhattan's flower district.She typically starts preparing for major events the day before, she says, and depending on the scale of the event, she either takes the flowers back to her apartment, or rents a studio space for the day. McCarthy has to \"process\" each flower – a \"pretty time-consuming\" task of taking off the leaves, cutting the stem, peeling off any old petals, and putting it in water – before she can start working on her arrangements.Once she's finished with her designs, she transports them to the venue by hiring a driver or renting a van herself.A bouquet McCarthy designed for an engagement party.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyAs a solo business owner, one of the biggest lessons she's learned has been \"knowing when to ask for help,\" she says. \"There have been a couple times where I pulled an all-nighter to finish everything, or I made all these arrangements by myself, when it would have taken half the time if I just asked for help,\" she says.McCarthy's main business goals for 2026 are to rent a permanent studio space and to launch a weekly floral arrangement subscription program as a way to create \"another consistent stream of income.\"She still posts her floral designs on social media, and often receives messages from aspiring florists hoping to learn about her career journey.\"That used to be me, reaching out to florists, wanting to learn from them,\" McCarthy says. \"The fact that I am now someone that others are inspired by is really crazy.\"\"It makes me feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing,\" she continues.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesRenowned investor Michael Burry on Wednesday said he is not currently shorting Tesla shares after calling the electric vehicle maker \"ridiculously overvalued.\"In a social media post on X, the Scion Asset Management founder responded to a user asking if he would bet against Tesla, saying, \"I am not short.\" Burry, who earned his reputation by successfully predicting the collapse of the U.S. housing market that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, clarified his position after describing Tesla as \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a separate post.\"The Big Short\" investor made the same assessment of Tesla's stock valuation to subscribers to his new paid Substack newsletter earlier in the month. Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the artificial intelligence boom.Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing delivery estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook.Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Read moreTesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight annual drop.Tesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. Shares of Tesla were up slightly in afternoon trading Wednesday. The company's stock has gained more than 12.5% in 2025.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.Correction: An earlier version of this story used deliveries and sales interchangeably. It has been updated to reflect the difference.",

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The composite PMI, a broader measure that tracks activity across manufacturing and services, climbed to 50.7 from 49.7 in November, pointing to broader improvement across the economy.China's non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, increased to 50.2 from 49.5 in November.Huo Lihui, chief statistician from China's National Bureau of Statistics, said that new orders rose in December, signaling a \"significant expansion\" in both production and demand in manufacturing.Private-sector data showed a similar trend. A separate PMI from independent research firm RatingDog showed manufacturing activity rising to 50.1 from 49.9, beating expectations of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog, said the reading indicated the manufacturing sector had returned to expansion. He noted that total new orders grew for a seventh consecutive month, supported by domestic new product launches and business development, leading to growth in production.However, Yao said that while firms remain confident for 2026, optimism has eased and remained below the historical average.Large enterprises drove the improvement, with their PMI rising to 50.8, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Activity among smaller firms remained weaker. The PMI for medium-sized enterprises rose to 49.8, while the index for small enterprises fell to 48.6, down 0.5 percentage points from November.Markets were mixed after the release. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.83%, while the mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.33%. The data followed a decision by China's central bank earlier this week to keep loan prime rates unchanged, despite weak economic data and an extended slump in the property sector plaguing the world's second-largest economy.November's retail sales and industrial output missed expectations, while investment in fixed assets also contracted. Hao Zhou, chief economist at securities company Guotai Junan International, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday that the reading was a \"very good, positive surprise to the market.\"\"Maybe the market is concerned about China's property market, China stock market, as well as the consumption,\" Zhou said. \"The data for now suggests that the economy is on the right trend, and the momentum remains solid.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term Tuesday, blocking bills that would support a pair of bipartisan infrastructure projects in Colorado and Florida. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, which Congress unanimously approved earlier in December, enraged the state's lawmakers. The bill would reduce the payments local communities must provide to the federal government for the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline poised to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. In a message to Congress after vetoing the legislation, Trump said the bill would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"\"Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies,\" he said. Bipartisan Colorado lawmakers who pushed the bill erupted after the veto, vowing Congress will override it. Some argued that Trump is making good on his vow for retribution after Colorado refused to free Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who was convicted last year of crimes relating to the breach of voting machines after the 2020 election.Trump warned earlier this year in a Truth Social post that if she was not released, he would \"take harsh measures!!!\" Trump issued a pardon for Peters in December, but it was largely symbolic since Peters was convicted in a state court.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"This isn't governing.

I'll keep fighting to get rural Colorado the clean water they deserve.\"Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., also alleged Trump's veto was partisan. \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water,\" Hickenlooper said on X. \"Congress should swiftly overturn this veto.\"GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert, a staunch Trump ally, said on her X account that \"This isn't over.\"In a statement she gave to Colorado-based NBC-affiliate KUSA, Boebert said she \"hope[s] this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability.\"Boebert was one of the Republicans who joined Democrats in compelling the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump did not mention Peters in his rationale for vetoing the legislation. On Wednesday, however, he issued a Truth Social post saying, \"God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison.\"\"Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting 'Republican' (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,\" the President wrote.Congress' unanimous passage of the bill suggests it will have the votes to override Trump's veto if GOP leadership in both chambers allows it. Two-thirds of both the House and the Senate would be needed to override the veto.Rep. Jeff Hurd, another Colorado Republican, said in a post to X that he will \"continue fighting for rural Colorado by working across party lines to get this project back on track and ensure our communities are not left behind.\" CNBC has reached out to House Speaker Mike Johnson's office to ask if he will allow the chamber to override the veto. The Florida bill Trump vetoed, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, also passed Congress by voice vote. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include an area known as the Osecola Camp, part of the Everglades National Park. Trump in a message to Congress said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"In Trump's first term, he vetoed a total of 10 bills. His first veto came in 2019, two years into his term, to overturn a congressional move to end a national emergency at the southern border. Congress failed to override that veto.",

    "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks about the killing of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at the State Emergency operations Center in Blaine, Minn.. Saturday, June 14, 2025.Jerry Holt | Star Tribune via APCongressional Republicans on Wednesday called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to testify amid an ongoing social services fraud scandal, as the White House signaled it could expand its investigations into other blue states.A day after the Trump administration said it would freeze hundreds of millions of dollars of child-care funds to Minnesota, House Oversight and Government Reform Chair James Comer, R-Ky., invited Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, to appear before the panel on Feb. 10. \"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said in a Wednesday statement.An earlier hearing, slated for Jan. 7, will feature Minnesota state officials who sounded the alarm or investigated the fraud.\"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money,\" he continued.Walz, who took office in 2019, has come under fire in recent months over fraud scams that occurred during his administration. He has recently faced calls to resign. The scandals date back several years and may have cost taxpayers billions of dollars, according to prosecutors.Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have seized on reports of fraud to target Walz and other Democratic leaders, as well as Somalis living in Minnesota.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationAlso on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an appearance on \"Fox & Friends\" that other states could be next and that Trump was on board with revoking the citizenship of implicated Somali Americans.\"Minnesota is the top of the list, but we know there has been massive fraud in blue states across this country. Look at California. Look at New York. These states will all be under investigation and consideration as far as this administration is concerned,\" Leavitt said.\"Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia,\" Trump said Wednesday in a Truth Social post in which he also attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat and the first Somali American to serve in Congress. Trump called Omar \"an ungrateful loser.\"Omar could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\"Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country's greatness. Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth,\" Trump said. He also called Walz a \"crooked governor.\"A spokesperson for Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket in 2024, responded on Wednesday: \"We're always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.\" \"While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out,\" the statement continued.In a Wednesday press release, Ellison defended his record, claiming he has \"prosecuted over 300 Medicaid fraud cases and won over $80 million in recoveries and restitution for the people of Minnesota,\" since taking office in 2019.Ellison also said he and his team were \"exploring all legal options\" in response to the halted child-care funds.\"This hasty, scorched earth-attack is not just wrong, it may well be illegal,\" Ellison said.The freezing of child-care money, as well as FBI Director Kash Patel's Sunday announcement of a surge of federal agents to Minnesota, followed a viral video posted over the weekend by a conservative influencer that purported to show nonoperational child-care facilities that received federal funds. The video brought renewed attention to long-simmering allegations of fraud that have raised questions about Walz's leadership and led to the targeting of Minnesota's large Somali community for its alleged role in various schemes.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill and Assistant Secretary Alex Adams announced the funding freeze in a post Tuesday on X. O'Neill also announced a nationwide verification system to authorize child-care payments, demanded that Walz investigate individuals suspected of fraud and announced a fraud-reporting hotline.\"We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake daycares to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade,\" O'Neill said.\"Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,\" O'Neill wrote in a subsequent post.Vice President JD Vance applauded the move.\"Turning off payments and forcing verification before taxpayer money flows out the door is one of the most important steps we can take to end the fraud in Minnesota. But there will be many more to come,\" Vance said Tuesday on X. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday posted that 98 individuals had been charged and more than 60 had been found guilty in court. Of those charged, 85 are of Somali descent, according to Bondi.\"We have more prosecutions coming…BUCKLE UP, LAWMAKERS!\" Bondi said on X.Investigations into Minnesota's social services program date back several years. A federal prosecutor in Minnesota said earlier this month that more than a dozen Medicaid-funded programs were being probed and that as much as half of the $18 billion in taxpayer funds spent on those programs since 2018 may have been stolen.One Covid-era scam, which hinged on a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, led to charges for dozens of defendants who allegedly stole $250 million in taxpayer funds.Walz has come under fire for allowing the fraud to transpire on his watch. This weekend, a group of Minnesota Republicans called on Walz to resign, citing the state's \"fraud crisis.\"House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has also called on Walz to step down. In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Emmer praised the Trump administration's actions and took aim at his state's governor.\"Tim Walz's incompetence and inaction has hurt every Minnesotan, and now Walz is suffering the consequences,\" Emmer said. \"His failed leadership has allowed billions to be stolen from hardworking Minnesota taxpayers.\"",

Jonas Walzberg | ReutersChina has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its \"mistakes\" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should \"immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.\"\"What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. Read moreNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

    "body": "©Studio One-one | Moment Unreleased | Getty ImagesDepending on where you live, relying on a postmark to prove you mailed your tax return, mail-in ballot, bill payment or any other time-sensitive document by a specific date may no longer work as you expect.As the U.S. Postal Service continues implementing operational changes in an effort to shore up its finances and modernize its infrastructure, the agency expects an increase in delays between when you mail something and when it is postmarked, according to a public notice in the Federal Register that took effect Dec. 24. A postmark shows the date your mail was processed, and historically has been applied the same day you mail an item. However, due to limiting pickups at many postal locations and mail now often traveling farther to regional processing centers where the postmark is applied, \"the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of the mailpiece,\" the notice reads.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Here's who the lapse will hit hardestTrump officials to start garnishing wages of student loan borrowers in JanuaryCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile households increasingly use digital options to file taxes, pay bills and handle other personal business, there are still people who use the Postal Service for time-sensitive mail.Of the 163.6 million tax returns received by the IRS this year, about 10 million were not filed electronically, according to the agency's latest data. About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein during a party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported.About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The review of the staggering number of files will take until at least Jan. 20 to complete, the Times reported. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23.The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender.While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted \"an exhaustive review\" of its files on Epstein.Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers \"are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.\"\"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche wrote, adding, \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.\"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19.The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the \"next couple weeks.\"\"I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said at the time.On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been \"uncovered\" and that it would take \"a few more weeks\" to release them.The document cited by Reuters on Wednesday said that the 400 additional lawyers are being provided by the DOJ's Criminal Division and National Security Division, as well as the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.Newly-released documents from disgraced late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including a sheaf of entirely redacted pages, are seen in handouts released by the Justice Department and printed and arranged for a photograph by Reuters in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe FBI declined to comment. The other divisions and the Manhattan office did not immediately respond to CNBC's outreach.Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time-off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said.After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated.The department said it \"is not redacting the names of any politicians\" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a \"cover-up to protect Donald Trump,\" a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification",

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.The company also said it will take steps to wind down Manus AI's remaining business operations in China and that \"there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests\" after the transaction.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

    "description": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively ",
    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold and silver prices lost ground on Wednesday as investors booked profits after a historic annual rally and exchange operator CME Group hiked the margins on precious metal futures for the second time in the space of a week.Spot gold prices dipped 0.1% to $4,339.89 per ounce at 8:50 a.m. ET, extending losses in the run-up to the new year. The yellow metal notched a one-week low in the previous session.Spot silver prices, meanwhile, tumbled 5.6% to $72.15 per ounce, paring gains after climbing above $80 for the first time at the start of the week.The moves come at the end of a blockbuster year for the precious metals.Gold is up more than 64% year to date, on track for its best annual performance since 1979 and third straight positive year. The rally has been supported by a multitude of factors, including the impact of U.S. interest rate cuts, tariff tensions, and robust demand from exchange-traded funds and central banks.  Silver has far outpaced gold in 2025. The metal, which has endured wild price swings in recent days, is on course for annual gains of nearly 150%. Like gold, this would be silver's best yearly performance since 1979. Silver's price boom has stemmed from a mix of low supply and high demand from India, as well as industrial needs and tariffs.watch nowCME Group, one of the world's largest trading floors for commodities, said Tuesday that margins for gold, silver, platinum and palladium would increase again after the close of business Wednesday. It said in a statement that the decision was made \"as per the normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage.\"  The notice means traders will need to put up more cash on their bets to insure against the prospect of a default when they take delivery of the contract.CME Group raised margin requirements for precious metals earlier in the week, prompting gold and silver futures to fall sharply on Monday.— CNBC's Gaelle Legrand contributed to this report.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019, as officials debated the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting — 12 vote on rates — indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half-percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

Another whiff like that will only cement the idea that Apple is woefully behind its peers in AI and risks losing control over the next major computing platform to a rival like Google or a startup like OpenAI.Not only that, Apple must prove to investors that AI can generate meaningful sales growth after years of post-pandemic stagnation.How Apple got hereWe knew it was going to be a challenging 2025 for Apple long before the calendar turned over to the new year.With President Donald Trump's inauguration looming, no major tech company was more exposed to his impending tariff scheme than Apple.And then there was the looming AI question. Apple launched limited features for its Apple Intelligence system in the fall, but the real update, an AI-powered version of Siri that Apple advertised as a key feature in the iPhone 16, was scheduled to launch early in 2025. Apple shares were reaching new highs in anticipation of a groundbreaking AI experience built into the iPhone. It was all for nothing. It took months for Apple CEO Tim Cook to play the politician and woo the president with the promise of $600 billion in U.S. investments over the next four years, culminating in a stunning moment in the Oval Office when Cook gave the president a glass trophy with a solid gold base. The ploy worked. Even though analysts pointed out most of Cook's promised spending was already baked in, the president thought it was good enough. Trump dropped his demands for Apple to build iPhones on U.S. soil and gave Cook the tariff relief he wanted. With the tariff problem out of the way, Apple shares surged. The stock is up about 35% since that show in the Oval Office.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

Following an exodus of top execs, including AI boss John Giannandrea, Apple said it has the team in place to deliver the Siri upgrade in 2026, which could come as much as 21 months after the original announcement.Apple needs that new Siri to be good. Not just good enough to match the capabilities of popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, but also good enough to convince folks with older iPhones to upgrade to a new device so they can use it. Users need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to use Apple Intelligence.That was the Apple bull case a year ago. That Apple Intelligence, especially the new version of Siri, was going to be so amazing that people would get a new iPhone just to use it. That elusive iPhone \"super cycle\" was on the horizon. Nope. Perhaps next year. For investors, it's their best bet to see a boom in Apple shares from AI.Unlike the $20 per month OpenAI charges to use the full version of ChatGPT, Apple doesn't charge for Apple Intelligence. Unless Apple changes its strategy and starts charging a subscription, its only hope is to leverage AI to move new iPhones, Macs and iPads. It also opens up Apple to launch different kinds of hardware products, like the rumored smart glasses that could come as soon as next fall. But don't count on an accessory like that moving the needle too much at Apple. Apple rarely misses the way it did with AI this year, especially with something as important and as transformative as AI. Luckily for Apple, it's still early in the AI game. And it proved this year with the iPhone 17 lineup that new hardware designs and features can lead to sales growth. But it can only miss once. There's not going to be another chance for a mulligan.watch now",

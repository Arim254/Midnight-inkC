    "body": "A KKR logo displayed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 23, 2018.Brendan McDermid | ReutersPrivate equity firm KKR and Singapore Telecommunications will acquire the remaining 82% stake in data center operator ST Telemedia Global Data Centres for 6.6 billion Singapore dollars ($5.1 billion), KKR said in a statement on Wednesday.The deal pegs STT GDC's enterprise value at S$13.8 billion and comes at a time when there has been a jump in data center demand led by the boom in artificial intelligence.Following completion, KKR will hold a 75% stake in STT GDC, while Singtel will own the remaining 25%, taking into account the conversion of existing preference shares held by both investors.KKR said the deal represents its largest infrastructure investment in Asia Pacific to date, as global investment in data centers accelerates on rising need for cloud computing and artificial intelligence workloads.Singtel shares rose almost 2% to hit a record high before paring gains, and were last trading 0.41% higher. KKR shares, which lost nearly 10% on Tuesday, gained 0.5% in after hours trading. Global data centers' dealmaking hit a fresh record last year, driven by a rush to build out the infrastructure required for energy-intensive AI workloads, with S&P Global reporting that over $61 billion had flowed into the data center market, up from $60.8 billion last year.\"Digital infrastructure remains one of the most compelling long-term investment themes globally,\" said David Luboff, co-head of KKR Asia Pacific and head of Asia Pacific infrastructure, citing STT GDC's diversified footprint and development pipeline.Citi and the Bank of America are advisors to KKR and Singtel, while J.P. Morgan acted as sole financial advisor to ST Telemedia. The deal marks the largest M&A deal in Singapore in the last four years, data from Citi showed. Founded in 2014 and headquartered in Singapore, STT GDC operates data centers across 12 markets in Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom and Europe, with 2.3 gigawatts of design capacity. The company provides colocation, connectivity and support services to hyperscalers and enterprise customers.KKR and Singtel first invested in ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in June 2024, putting in $1.75 billion Singapore dollars for a minority stake.\"STT GDC's diverse geographical footprint increases our exposure to new markets and makes the Singtel Group a stronger data centre player with global reach,\" said Arthur Lang, group chief financial officer at Singtel.",

That was higher than analysts' estimates of $919 million.Overall, its group revenues were $12.1 billion for the final quarter of the year, which was in line with the $12.1 billion forecast by analysts. It was also down from $12.8 billion in the previous quarter, and up from $11.6 billion for the same period a year ago.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUBS.Meanwhile, UBS' common equity tier (CET) 1 capital ratio — a gauge of a bank's solvency — was 14.4% for the fourth quarter, compared to 14.8% in the previous quarter.CEO Sergio Ermotti — who is preparing to step down from his role as head of Switzerland's largest lender in April next year once its absorption of Credit Suisse is concluded — said the bank's group invested assets now exceed $7 trillion for the first time.\"We maintained a strong capital position and delivered on our capital return commitments in the year with an increased dividend complemented by share repurchases,\" he said in a statement. \"We are poised to achieve our 2026 exit rate targets and medium-term ambitions.\"Ermotti, who returned to the helm in 2023 to oversee the government-led emergency takeover of the UBS' stricken Swiss rival, added that the bank made \"great progress\" on \"one of the most complex integrations in banking history.\"Johann Scholtz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said the fourth-quarter earnings were another strong set of results for the bank.Speaking with CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Wednesday, Scholtz said UBS executed well on the Credit Suisse integration, but cautioned that there remains \"a bit of an overhang\" on the bank's share price from Switzerland's capital requirements rules.",

One version of the plan sees investors renting the homes out to tenants, with a portion of monthly payments counting toward a future down payment should they choose to buy after three years.Amid elevated interest rates and prices, housing affordability has emerged as a key issue for President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Trump said that the U.S. should ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has only exacerbated the housing affordability crisis. The president has also repeatedly said he wants to help first-time buyers, but without triggering a broad decline in existing home prices.\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people who own homes,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The proposal, dubbed \"Trump Homes\" by industry players, could ultimately involve as many as one million homes, Bloomberg reported. A White House official told the outlet that the administration is not actively considering the plan.After a rough year last year, Lennar shares are off to a good start for 2026, up 9%.",

We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places ... the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Trump said in that interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump: If states can't run elections 'honestly,' then 'somebody else should take over'Trump signs bill ending federal government shutdownSen.

That vote was close because hard-line Republicans wanted to compel the Senate to consider the SAVE Act, which would institute voter ID requirements across the country. Trump has urged congressional Republicans to pass that bill.States are primarily responsible for governing their own election systems under the U.S. Constitution. When asked about that fact on Tuesday, Trump replied, \"They can administer the election, but they have to do it honestly.\"He also said, \"If you think about it, a state is an agent for the federal government in elections. I don't know why the federal government doesn't do them anyway. But when you see some of these states about, how horribly they run their elections, what a disgrace it is.\"Trump echoed his frequent claim that elections in the 2020 cycle — when he lost his reelection bid to former President Joe Biden — were \"rigged\" and \"crooked.\" There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 elections.\"Take a look at Detroit,\" he said. \"Take a look at Philadelphia. You go take a look at Atlanta.\"\"Look at some of the places that — horrible corruption on elections, and the federal government should not allow that.

Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDemocrats on the Senate Banking Committee demanded that Chair Tim Scott delay the nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve until a pair of investigations into central bank Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lisa Cook conclude. The Department of Justice is investigating potential criminal wrongdoing by Powell related to cost overruns on the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. They are separately probing Cook, whom President Donald Trump has tried to fire, over allegations of mortgage fraud. Trump nominated Warsh last week to succeed Powell at the end of his term in May. The Democratic resistance all but assures that any one Republican senator will be able to hold up Warsh's confirmation until the probes end. The Banking Committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection on a nomination, along with all Democrats, will deadlock the panel and prevent the nomination from reaching the floor.\"We demand that you delay any nomination proceedings for Mr. Warsh until after the pretextual criminal investigations involving Chair Powell and Governor Cook have been closed,\" the Democratic senators, led by ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote.

But they have help from Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a Banking Committee member who has vowed to stonewall any Fed nominees until the investigation concludes. \"My position has not changed: I will oppose the confirmation of any Federal Reserve nominee, including for the position of Chairman, until the DOJ's inquiry into Chairman Powell is fully and transparently resolved,\" Tillis said on X after the Warsh nomination was announced.

    "body": "Novo Nordisk signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, US, on Friday, Jan. 2, 2026.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's U.S. shares plummeted Tuesday after the company said it sees sales and profit growth declining this year, hit by lower prices in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for its blockbuster Wegovy and Ozempic in China, Brazil and Canada. Novo's American depositary shares fell as much as 14% in afternoon trading, after a trading halt. The results were published after the closing bell in Copenhagen, where the company has its primary listing, and ahead of the scheduled release early Wednesday.For 2026, the drugmaker sees sales and operating profit both declining between 5% and 13% at constant exchange rates, far worse than analysts had expected.It comes as the Danish drugmaker is fighting to regain its footing in the weight-loss space amid fierce competition.\"In 2026, Novo Nordisk will face pricing headwinds in an increasingly competitive market,\" CEO Mike Doustdar. \"However, we are very encouraged by the promising early uptake from the US launch of Wegovy pill, and we remain confident in our ability to drive volume growth over the coming years.\"The outlook reflects expectations for a sales decline in the U.S., its biggest market, but sales growth ex-U.S. Novo said. \"In 2026, the global GLP-1 market expansion is assumed to continue, enabling Novo Nordisk to increase patient reach and expand volumes,\" the company said in a statement.In 2025, sales increased by 10% and operating profit increased by 6%, in line with the company's latest guidance, which it lowered throughout 2025, citing challenges in the U.S. market.Novo also said that it will roll out Wegovy in more markets in 2026 and expects to introduce the higher 7.2 mg dose in a number of countries.Mounting pressureStock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo Nordisk stock has seen steep declines over the past year.Novo launched the oral version of the blockbuster weight-loss medicine Wegovy in the U.S. early January, and, despite its promising start, the market is closely watching how Novo Nordisk will fare along with U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which is expected to launch its own weight loss pill in the first half of 2026.\"Investors want to see they are making the most of this lead, particularly in the direct to patient (mostly self-pay or cash pay) channel, closing some of the large gap that widened between them and Lilly in this channel in 2025,\" said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen.Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, is losing exclusivity in markets like Canada, Brazil and China in 2026. Together with significant pricing pressure in its largest market, the U.S., analysts had forecast sales growth to moderate this year to single digits after several years of much higher growth.Coming into the print, Barclays analyst James Gordon said the Novo guide was expected to crystalize further downgrades, however could also act as a clearing event given the \"significant investor concern\" about this year's outlook.\"[Guidance] cuts could be at least partly mitigated by investors taking the opportunity to then buy into the Oral Wegovy US launch and Injectable Wegovy potential US volume inflection this year.\"Novo has faced pressure for the past 18 months as rival U.S.-based Eli Lilly's rival weight-loss drug tirzepatide – sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound – resulted in more pronounced weight loss than Novo's medicine, and surpassed Novo in U.S. market share.Ozempic and Wegovy salesNovo and Lilly in November announced a deal with the Trump administration to cut prices for their best-selling drugs, which are expected to increase volumes but ultimately hurt total sales. The agreements involved cutting prices of their GLP-1 drugs for Medicare and Medicaid in 2026 as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the forthcoming TrumpRx.gov website, expected to launch in January.In the fourth quarter, Novo net sales amounted to 79.1 billion Danish kroner ($12.5 billion), slightly ahead of analysts' expectations of 77.8 billion kroner, according to LSEG estimates. Operating profit in the quarter was largely in line with estimates at 31.7 billlion kroner, down 14% year-on-year.Ozempic, its best-selling medicine, brought in 31.8 billion in the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year at constant exchange rates. Wegovy sales were 21.9 billion kroner, up 17%.- CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report",

With agent-powered coding, programmers have artificial intelligence software write code independently. Apple said its tool will support Anthropic's Claude Agent and OpenAI's Codex.\"Xcode and coding agents can now work together to handle complex multi-step tasks on your behalf,\" an Apple representative said in a demo video on Tuesday, alongside the announcement. Over the summer, Apple updated Xcode with support for OpenAI's ChatGPT and Claude, but the latest update extends the relationship to agentic coding tools. In an email sent to developers, Apple said the agents will be able to build and test projects, search Apple documentation and fix issues.Individual programmers and companies have embraced agentic coding as a faster way to build software through a practice known as \"vibe coding,\" where humans prompt an AI and review the code it generates. Apple Intelligence, the company's consumer AI suite, has faced delays and management turnover. But in recent months, AI coding has gained traction among iPhone developers. Users will have to connect their OpenAI or Anthropic accounts to Xcode via an API key. Apple said it uses an open standard that gives programmers the ability to use other compatible agents and AI tools with Xcode, in addition to the built-in Anthropic and OpenAI integrations. Apple's Xcode is the company's developer environment for coders, and it is used to build nearly every iPhone app. The new software, Xcode 26.3, is available in a beta version now for registered Apple developers, and will eventually be released on the App Store. OpenAI released a version of its agentic coding application called Codex for Mac computers on Monday.WATCH: Experimenting with AI vibe-codingwatch now",

    "body": "Bill Ready, CEO of Pinterest, speaks at the 28th annual Milken Institute Global Conference at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on May 5, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesPinterest CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved. \"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions,\" Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. \"But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist.\" Pinterest announced on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go. Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a \"critical moment\" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're \"working against the direction of the company\" and disagree with its mission, he said. Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.\"I know people have natural curiosity around these things,\" Ready said. \"We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level.\" A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.\"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy.\"Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders Meta and Google. Investors have raised concerns around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for shopping, \"which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025. \"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us,\" Ready said. \"We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus.\"More recently, Pinterest's advertising sales slowed as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.  Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. Amazon last week said it would lay off about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October. Meta cut about 10% of staff in its Reality Labs unit, while design software maker Autodesk slashed about 7% of its workforce.WATCH: Pinterest CEO Bill Ready learned one key business lesson earlywatch now",

    "body": "Nintendo Co. Switch 2 game consoles at a Bic Camera Inc. electronics store in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, June 5, 2025. Nintendo Co. fans from Tokyo to Manhattan stood in line for hours to be among the first to get a Switch 2, fueling one of the biggest global gadget debuts since the iPhone launches of yesteryear. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNintendo shares plunged more than 10% on Wednesday, a day after the gaming giant missed market estimates for quarterly revenue and as it faces headwinds from an unprecedented memory shortage. The company beat profit estimates though, clocking a 24% jump year on year, bolstered by sustained sales of its Nintendo Switch — now the company's best selling console ever following its release in 2017. Revenue rose 86%.Nintendo is facing pressure this year from a shortage in memory chips — a key component in its gaming consoles — that has resulted in surging prices.  According to a note from Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese Equity Strategy at Ortus Advisors, investors remain concerned about the impact that memory costs will have on the company's margins. While Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said Tuesday that memory price rises were not significantly impacting results for the financial year, he said it could impact profitability if the component costs remain high over the longer term. Nintendo primarily uses dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, in its consoles. This type of memory is suffering from shortages due to growing AI and data center demands. Contract prices for conventional DRAM chips in the first quarter of the year are projected to rise 90% to 95% compared to the previous three months, according to a report from market researcher TrendForce on Monday. Last month, a top semiconductor industry CEO told CNBC that the memory chip shortage was expected to persist through 2027. \"If the current trend in the memory space continues, I would not be surprised at all to see Nintendo raising prices,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of game consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC in an email. Nintendo's latest console, Switch 2, is already an expensive device, and price increases would be hard for \"Nintendo's rather casual user base\" to swallow, Toto said. Nintendo released the Switch 2 in June last year, and it now makes up the lion's share of its console sales.  In addition to the memory crunch, analysts say that investors have been concerned about the performance of the Switch 2, despite Nintendo maintaining its full-year sales forecast for the console on Tuesday. \"The main concern seems to be momentum: The first year is absolutely critical for every new console,\"  Toto said. \"In that sense, Nintendo is a victim of its own success, as Switch 1 had a stellar first 12 months after launch - which is hard to replicate today.\"Nintendo's ability to replicate that success will likely rely on the success of its pipeline of upcoming Switch 2 games and whether they are enough to convince consumers to upgrade to the gaming console.In February, Nintendo plans to release \"Mario Tennis Fever\" for the Switch 2, and \"Pokémon Pokopia\" in March — two titles from its most popular franchises.The company also has \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" set for release in April. The first Super Mario movie, released in 2023, provided a significant boost to Nintendo's console sales, with the company likely hoping for a similar effect on the Switch 2.On Tuesday, James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia, told CNBC that 2026 would be a \"make-or-break\" year for Switch 2′s future as Nintendo looks to gain more mass-market appeal.Nintendo's shares have lost more than 15% so far this year. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

The Shahed-139 drone \"aggressively approached\" the aircraft carrier with \"unclear intent,\" U.S. Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins told CNBC in a statement.The Abraham Lincoln was about 500 miles from Iran's southern coast when the unmanned aircraft \"unnecessarily maneuvered\" toward the ship, Hawkins said. U.S. forces were operating in international waters and took de-escalatory measures, but the drone continued to fly toward the aircraft carrier, he said. An F-35 warplane from the Abraham Lincoln shot down the drone \"in self defense to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" Hawkins said. No U.S. personnel were harmed and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he said. U.S. crude oil prices were up more than 1% at 2:32 p.m. ET. Hours after the drone was shot down, Iranian forces harassed a U.S. flagged and crewed merchant vessel that was lawfully transiting the Strait of Hormuz, Hawkins said. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces threatened to board and seize the M/V Stena Imperative, he said.A U.S. guided missile destroyer intervened and de-escalated the situation and the merchant vessel is now proceeding safely, Hawkins said.Trump has deployed the Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with strikes if it does not negotiate a deal over its nuclear program. The president threatened to hit the Islamic Republic during mass demonstrations against the regime last month but ultimately held back from strikes. The incidents Tuesday come as Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to have discussions with Iranian officials later this week. Those conversations are still scheduled to take place, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News in an interview. \"As for the president, he remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first,\" Leavitt said. \"But in order for diplomacy to work of course it takes two to tango. You need a willing partner to engage.\" Leavitt said Trump \"always has a range of options on the table and that includes the use of military force.\" ",

At the time, Miran said he expected to fill out Kugler's term, which expired Jan. 31, then return to his CEA post. However, he said then that if his time at the Fed extended beyond that date, he would resign from the CEA.

He has voted \"no\" at each of the four Federal Open Market Committee meetings he has attended. Central bank policymakers cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-percentage point at three of those meetings; Miran argued for half-point reductions. Most recently, he voted against policymakers' decision to hold rates steady in a range of 3.5% to 3.75% at the January meeting. He wanted to lower rates by a quarter point.In a Friday interview on CNBC's \"Money Movers,\" Miran noted that his seat would be the only vacancy available on the board of governors for Warsh.In a post on social media network X, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said that Miran's departure came \"141 days too late.\"Barron's first reported on Miran's plan to leave the CEA. ",

    "body": "The trade pact between India and the U.S. — which will see tariffs on Indian exports lowered to 18% from 25% — comes less than a week after India reached a major free trade agreement with the EU.Announcing the deal in a TruthSocial post, Trump said India had agreed to cease buying Russian crude oil. He had previously imposed an additional 25% levy in retaliation to this. India will switch to U.S., and potentially Venezuelan, oil, while also pledging to buy $500 billion in agriculture, tech, energy, and other products, Trump said. While many specific details of the India-U.S. deal are yet to be fully hashed out — in contrast with last week's comprehensive agreement between the EU and India — India's manufacturing sector is seen as a major initial beneficiary, according to investors, while I.T. and pharmaceuticals could also see a boost.The country's labor-intensive export sector — which spans textiles, clothing, leather, jewelry, toys and furniture making — now has the opportunity to regain ground lost to key manufacturing competitors in the region, according to James Thom, senior investment director of Asian equities, at Aberdeen Investments.Thom pinpointed smaller and medium companies as among those likely to see a boost from the new 18% tariff rate, which is lower than that of rival Pakistan, where the levy is 19%, as well as Vietnam and Bangladesh — each subject to 20% tariffs.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNifty 50.\"Removing that overhang should also support banks, non-banking financial companies and export-oriented manufacturers, while lifting retail sentiment in small and mid-caps,\" Thom said in a market commentary.Bernstein said that last week's India-EU treaty likely prompted the U.S. to accelerate Monday's deal with India. Analysts noted how the agreement brings India broadly in line with its Association of Southeast Asian Nations peers — \"incrementally a big positive\" — and boosts its position relative to China.Improved relationsBernstein analysts Venugopal Garre and Nikhil Arela said that, while certain sectors such as autos and metals could still face sector tariffs, information technology will benefit from improved relations between the two countries.\"I.T. has the largest exposure to the US, and while the deal primarily covers manufactured goods, our outlook was that improved US-India relations — even if short-lived — would reduce scrutiny on I.T. services and lower the risk of further punitive actions, such as additional taxes,\" Garre and Arela wrote.They outlined a tactical 'buy' trade based on a short-term rebound in Indian equities underpinned mainly by financials, I.T., and telecoms, while manufacturing and trade-linked stocks \"should also see some recovery.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index.Monday's deal comes hot on the heels of India's \"landmark\" FTA with the EU — dubbed \"the mother of all deals\" by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen — which substantially lowers or eliminates tariffs on a range of goods and services.Fitch Ratings' research unit BMI zeroed in on India's pharmaceutical sector, highlighting the elimination of 11% tariffs on EU drug imports — such as cancer therapies, biologics, and GLP-1s — which amounted to $1.2 billion in 2024. Growth trajectoryBMI said lower import costs and improved supply chains underpin its positive outlook on India's pharma space, where it sees a market growth of $31.2 billion in 2025 to $45.7 billion by 2035 — a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 5.2% in local currency terms.\"The agreement will also help India-based firms to diversify export destinations and open new opportunities in the large EU market,\" it added, noting how India's pharmaceutical exports have stagnated recently.\"This recent stagnation reflects ongoing market access challenges and regulatory complexity. We believe the FTA will reverse this trend, as the deal is expected to align regulatory compliance processes, reducing approval timelines and lowering administrative costs associated with product registration and licensing. This will position exports to resume their growth trajectory.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAshoka India Investment Trust.Russ Mould, investment director at A.J. Bell, said the trade deal lifted market sentiment and gave greater clarity to investors, highlighting the Sensex's 2.5% rise following the agreement. The Sensex is made up of 30 companies that are some of the largest and most actively traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange. U.K.-listed investment trusts with exposure to India were also among the major gainers on the FTSE 250 on Monday, including Ashoka India's 5.6%, Mould added.\"India has been a rich source of returns for investors over the past few decades, but Trump's tariff regime stalled momentum in the Sensex index,\" Mould said. \"Investors will now be wondering if the trade deal effectively removes the shackles on the market and breathes new life into it, rather than simply resulting in a short-term relief rally.\"— CNBC's Chloe Taylor and Michael Bloom contributed to this story.",

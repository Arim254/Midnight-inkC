    "body": "A volunteer displays information on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) at a grocery store in Dorchester, Massachusetts, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States would not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration.Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government.The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November.Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, \"SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"The White House, when asked by CNBC for clarification on Trump's statement given the court filing Monday, said, \"Refer you to the President's truth.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at a briefing later, told reporters that \"the administration is fully complying with the court order.\"Leavitt said she had spoken to Trump about his post, and added, \"The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money, because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position.\"\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future, and that's what he was referring to in his Truth Social post,\" Leavitt said.She also said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had issued guidance on Tuesday to individual states about the amount of money being disbursed to SNAP recipients.The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments \"cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\"The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, \"The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits — even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious.\"McConnell later told the Trump administration to respond to the request by Wednesday.The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersNorway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting this week, rebelling against management guidance and threats from Musk to step down if the deal is rejected.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund — the largest of its kind in the world, and a major shareholder in Tesla — said on Tuesday that it had already cast its vote against Musk's remuneration package as CEO of the carmaker.\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" NBIM said in a statement.\"We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\" the fund's managers added.Norway's wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, according to its half-year filings in June. The value of that investment was last declared to be 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion).Tesla shares were 2.5% lower in premarket trade.Tesla's Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve a pay plan for Musk that could see him granted almost $1 trillion in stock and expand his voting powers at the company. The full award would be contingent on Tesla hitting certain milestones over the next 10 years.The proposals have raised eyebrows and been met with opposition from some company watchers. Last month, the Take Back Tesla campaign — a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs — urged shareholders to reject the deal, while proxy advisories Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended investors vote against the compensation package.Musk has hit back at those recommendations, labeling ISS and Glass Lewis \"corporate terrorists\" on an analyst call.\"Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,\" Musk wrote in a post on X last month in response to a critic of the pay proposal. \"Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won't be me.\"Representatives for Musk and Tesla were not immediately available to comment on NBIM's vote against the proposed CEO compensation package.However, Musk has butted heads with NBIM over his pay in the past.Last year, NBIM voted against reinstating Musk's $56 billion pay deal after it was rescinded by a U.S. judge. The package — the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history — was ultimately approved by Tesla's shareholders.Following the vote, the Financial Times and Norwegian newspaper E24 published text messages exchanged between Musk and NBIM Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen, which showed the Tesla CEO declining an invitation to a dinner in Norwegian capital Oslo.\"When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends,\" Musk reportedly wrote. \"Friends are as friends do.\"Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $504.1 billion.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A Pizza Hut store is seen on November 01, 2023 in Austin, Texas. Pizza Hut's third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' expectations for same-store sales. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Tuesday announced it will explore strategic options for Pizza Hut.\"The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,\" Yum CEO Chris Turner said in a statement.The company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the review process. While Yum did not specify what the review's \"range of strategic options\" include, potential outcomes could be an outright divestiture, a joint venture or the sale of a stake in the chain.\"We do think the business can be positioned for even greater success in the future,\" Turner said on the company's earnings conference call. \"In some markets, there may be a multi-year effort that is required to reposition it as the leading pizza brand in those markets, and it's possible that those efforts may best be done under a different structure, potentially under outside ownership.\"Pizza Hut has been a part of a triumvirate with KFC and Taco Bell for decades, dating back to when PepsiCo still owned the fast-food chains. The beverage giant spun off the restaurants in 1997, christening the new company Tricon Global, later renamed to Yum.Tuesday's announcement caps years of struggle for Pizza Hut.On Tuesday, Yum reported that the chain's same-store sales fell 1% during the third quarter, fueled by a 6% drop in its home market. During the same quarter, Taco Bell and KFC reported same-store sales growth of 7% and 3%, respectively.Before the pandemic, Pizza Hut tried to shrug off its reputation as a dine-in venue and reposition itself as an option for pizza delivery and carryout in the U.S. When Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered restaurants, the chain saw its sales skyrocket, like the rest of its pizza industry. But once restrictions loosened, so-called pizza fatigue settled in, leading to another sales slump.And now, with consumers dining out less often, Pizza Hut is facing increased competition for a smaller set of diners. The chain's share of the U.S. pizza market has shrunk from 22.6% in 2019 to 18.7% in 2024, ceding customers to rival Domino's Pizza, according to Barclays.In the wake of the pullback in consumer spending, other restaurant companies have recently shed challenged parts of their businesses in an effort to improve their balance sheets.Starbucks on Monday announced it is selling a majority stake in its embattled China business and will form a joint venture with Boyu Capital. Last month, Jack in the Box divested Del Taco for $115 million, well short of the $575 million it paid for the chain less than four years ago. And Krispy Kreme sold its remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies this summer to focus on growing its U.S. business profitably.",

    "body": "A jobseeker holds a brochure during a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmployment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed.The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100.The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available.Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators.The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January.Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January.A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%.Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target.\"Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. \"We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer.\"The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%.",

NYSEBeta Technologies, an electric aircraft company, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday at $34 a share.On Monday, the company priced shares in its IPO at $34 each, above its expected range of $27 to $33. Beta said it sold 29.9 million shares, raising over $1 billion. The stock traded about 5% lower after it opened.Beta's IPO marks a major test for the small but competitive electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry that's been vying for approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. The nascent market is currently led by the likes of Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation, and proponents say the technology can ease air traffic congestion.In Beta's IPO prospectus, the company names Archer as one of its customers for its ground support equipment, which mostly consists of chargers. Beta says its chargers are installed in 51 U.S. locations.However, the business is currently very small. During the first half of the year, Beta said its net loss widened to $183.2 million from from $137.1 million in the year-ago period. Revenue more than doubled to $15.6 million from $7.6 million a year ago. Beta was founded in 2017.Founder and CEO Kyle Clark, who is also a test pilot for Beta, told CNBC on Tuesday that aircrafts are currently conducting certain \"back end\" missions for the U.S. military. He said he expects the company to achieve full FAA certification for commercial operations in about 30 monthsClark said the company needed to demonstrate success in production and operations and a pipeline of back orders to offer \"fundamental business reasons to walk into the public markets.\"Beta is going public during a prolonged government shutdown that started at the beginning of October. The Securities and Exchange Commission is operating with a limited staff.Still, Clark said the company decided to \"keep the train on the rails\" and proceed during the shutdown.Amazon and General Electric are two of the company's leading investors, with stakes of 10.2% and 6.3%, respectively, before the IPO. GE Aerospace said in September it was making a $300 million in Beta. Amazon first invested in 2021 out of its Climate Pledge Fund, part of an effort to \"reach net-zero carbon by 2040.\"Shares of eVTOL competitor Joby and Archer fell 9% and 6%, respectively. Both companies have roughly tripled in value over the last year. WATCH: Beta Technologies CEO on the company's market debutwatch now",

The firm previously submitted an offer for Papa John's alongside Irth Capital Management, according to Reuters.Apollo and Papa John's did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Papa John's is preparing to release its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The company's stock is down nearly 30% in the last year.The report comes as restaurants and other consumer-focused companies have been reporting sluggish sales amid rising inflation and costs.Last week, Chipotle executives said the fast food chain saw a 0.8% traffic decline, marking the third straight quarter of declines and a pullback in consumers across all income cohorts. Procter & Gamble reported in October that its lower-income customers are significantly paring back their spending.The report follows another significant deal development in the restaurant space. Earlier on Tuesday, Yum Brands said it plans to review strategic options for Pizza Hut, following years of struggles for the pizza chain.",

    "body": "watch nowSaudi Arabia will capitalize on its abundant supply of cheap natural gas and renewables to transform the kingdom into a global leader in artificial intelligence, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC in an interview.Aramco, the world's largest oil company, disclosed in late October that it plans acquire a significant minority stake in the new artificial intelligence company Humain. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, is the majority owner of Humain, which launched in May.Humain will become Saudi's national AI champion and will grow into a leader in the space, Nasser told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview that aired Tuesday. Humain CEO Tareq Amin has said Saudi is aiming to become the third biggest player in AI worldwide behind only the U.S. and China.\"Here, if you want renewable, you will find the lowest cost renewable,\" Nasser said. \"If you want gas, you will find the lowest cost gas. Energy is available and land is also available to build all these things.\"Data centers that train and run AI applications are requiring tremendous amounts of electricity, which is typically generated either by renewables and natural gas. The facilities will consume almost four times the electricity of the global electric vehicle fleet by 2030, Nasser said. They will primarily be powered by gas but also renewables, the CEO said.A significant portion of Armaco's capital spending is going toward boosting natural gas production more than 60% by 2030 to meet demand and toward the investment in Humain, Nasser said. Aramco is targeting capital expenditures of $52 billion to $58 billion this year, he said.Armaco sees oil and gas demand growing for decades to come on consumption in developing markets particularly in Asia, Nasser said. Demand will grow by 1.1 million barrels per day to 1.3 million bpd this year and almost the same in 2026, he said.\"There is huge potential for growth in emerging economies,\" he said.",

Abigail Spanberger or Winsome Earle-Sears, the state's Republican lieutenant governor.Virginia is one of 18 states that have never had a female governor. The winner will succeed Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who is term-limited from running again.Polls of the governor's race, one of just two such contests taking place the year after President Donald Trump's election in 2024, have consistently favored Spanberger.Meanwhile, the state attorney general's race between Democratic nominee Jay Jones and Republican incumbent Jason Miyares has tightened to an apparent toss-up amid a major controversy.Read more CNBC politics coverageNYC mayoral election: Mamdani, Cuomo, Sliwa fight to replace Adams as Trump weighs inNJ governor election: Sherrill and Ciattarelli face off in close race as Trump, Obama weigh inVirginia governor election: Spanberger and Earle-Sears vie to succeed YoungkinSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsJones once appeared likely to dominate over Miyares, polls showed. But Jones' campaign has come under intense fire since early last month, when his 2022 texts envisioning violence against a GOP political opponent were published by National Review.Jones has repeatedly apologized for sending the texts, including during his Oct. 16 debate with Miyares.The scandal shook up elections statewide, with Republican groups spending millions on a flurry of ads attacking Jones, NBC News reported. The texts emerged as Republicans have sought to link Democrats' rhetoric to acts of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Some Virginia Democrats disavowed the texts, but few if any called on Jones to drop out of the race. Jones joined Spanberger and former President Barack Obama at a get-out-the-vote rally in Norfolk on Saturday.Earle-Sears saw a fundraising boost as the controversy unfolded, and she sought to capitalize on the scandal in her mid-October debate versus Spanberger. But multiple polls released shortly before Election Day show Spanberger maintaining a double-digit lead over her opponent.This is developing news. Please check back for updates.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersAmazon is building a subsea fiber-optic cable called Fastnet to connect Maryland's Eastern shore to County Cork, Ireland, in what will be the company's first wholly-owned subsea cable project.Subsea fiber-optic communication cables carry over 95% of international data and voice traffic across the globe. These cables transmit hundreds of terabits of data per second including government communications, financial transactions, email, video calls and streaming.Amazon has invested in several subsea cable projects in the past, including Jako, Bifrost and Havfrue as part of a consortium, but Fastnet is the first time that the tech company undertakes one of these projects alone.\"Subsea is really essential for for AWS and for any connectivity internationally across oceans,\" Matt Rehder, Amazon Web Services vice president of core networking, told CNBC in an interview about Amazon's subsea cable investments.\"Without subsea you'd have to rely on satellite connectivity which can work,\" he said. \"But satellite has higher latency, higher costs and you just can't get enough capacity or throughput to what our customers and the internet in general needs.\"Amazon says that Fastnet's capacity will exceed 320 terabits per second, which is equivalent to streaming 12.5 million HD movies simultaneously. The company is building this cable to meet rising demand for cloud computing, artificial intelligence and edge applications that use Amazon Web Services.Fastnet will also strengthen Amazon's network resilience. Amazon did not say how much Fastnet would cost to construct, but the company said it expects it to be operational by 2028. Other technology giants including Google, Meta and Microsoft have also been investing in subsea cable infrastructure.WATCH: Amazon’s biggest AI data center is now operational in Indiana, powering Anthropic without Nvidiawatch now",

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid roughly 9% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell more than 2% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesMetsera on Tuesday said Novo Nordisk's new bid for the obesity biotech is \"superior\" to a revised offer from Pfizer, escalating a heated tussle over the startup between the two pharmaceutical giants. Novo Nordisk's new proposal values Metsera at up to $86.20 per share, for a total of around $10 billion. In a release, Metsera said that represents a roughly 159% premium to its closing price as of Sept. 19, the last trading day before Pfizer announced its proposed acquisition of the company. Meanwhile, Pfizer's new proposal values Metsera at up to $70 per share, for a total of roughly $8.1 billion. Under the terms of the original agreement for Pfizer to acquire Metsera, the drugmaker has two business days to negotiate adjustments to the proposal. If Metsera's board believes that Novo Nordisk's proposal is still better than Pfizer's after that window, Metsera would be entitled to end the existing merger agreement, according to the release.\"We believe that Novo Nordisk's offer is illusory, and cannot constitute a superior proposal under the terms of our merger agreement with Metsera because it violates antitrust law and there is a high risk it will never be consummated,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.In a statement Tuesday, Novo Nordisk confirmed its new bid and said it could maximize the potential of Metsera's complementary drug portfolio. Novo Nordisk reiterated that the proposal complies with all applicable laws and \"is in the best interest of patients who will benefit from our commitment to innovation, as well as Metsera's shareholders.\"The new bids comes one day after Pfizer filed its second lawsuit against Novo Nordisk and Metsera, alleging that the Danish drugmaker's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire the biotech company is anticompetitive. The clash reflects the shifting landscape for blockbuster weight loss and diabetes drugs, with veteran Novo Nordisk now trailing rival Eli Lilly as other companies like Pfizer race to break in.Metsera, founded in 2022, brings a pipeline of both oral and injectable treatments with different targets, including a drug targeting GLP-1 and another targeting another gut hormone called amylin. Both are being studied as potential once-monthly treatments, which would mean they are taken less frequently than the weekly injections on the market.For Pfizer, Metsera's pipeline could be the company's golden ticket to enter the space after struggling to bring its own obesity products to market over the last few years. Novo Nordisk helped establish the market, but is losing market share to Eli Lilly and cheaper copycats and struggling to impress investors with its drug pipeline. Pfizer in September said that it would acquire Metsera for $4.9 billion, or up to $7.3 billion with future payments.But Novo Nordisk launched a takeover bid Thursday valuing the biotech at around $6 billion, or up to $9 billion, triggering a deadline of four business days for Pfizer to renegotiate its offer.",

At others, voters will be directed to a nearby polling location to cast their ballot,\" Platkin said.Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, in a separate statement, said, \"Earlier today, bomb threats were made to several polling sites. Law enforcement has determined there are no credible threats at this time.\"\"We are doing everything in our power to protect voters and poll workers and encourage every eligible voter to exercise their right to vote.\"The race — one of just two U.S. gubernatorial elections this year — is seen as a bellwether for how President Donald Trump's all-consuming presence is affecting support for Republicans nationally.The result also could help shape the electoral landscape for the 2026 midterms, when Democrats hope to retake control of at least one chamber of Congress.The former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot Sherrill has represented New Jersey's 11th congressional district in the House of Representatives since 2019.Ciattarelli is a businessman who has run for governor twice before.New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Rep.

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe race's winner will succeed current Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is finishing his second and final term.While Democrats far outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, some polls leading up to Tuesday's election showed a neck-and-neck race between the candidates.But early voting totals before Election Day showed Democrats building a solid turnout advantage, according to DecisionDeskHQ Data Science Director Michael Pruser.Trump lost New Jersey to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. But he drew a larger share of the vote than he had received in the 2016 election, partly by making inroads with the state's Latino communities.Sherrill courted those voters, who have traditionally favored Democrats, in part by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail and in TV ads.She has also run a campaign centered on affordability, hewing to Democrats' broader messaging strategy.\"Vote Here Today\" signage outside a polling location at Hillside Elementary School in Montclair, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.

    "body": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks during a press conference after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine at the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium, April 23, 2021.John Thys | ReutersPfizer on Thursday reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates and hiked its full-year profit guidance, as cost cuts helped to outweigh declining sales for the period.The pharmaceutical giant now expects its full-year adjusted profit to come in between $3 and $3.15 per share, up from previous guidance of $2.90 to $3.10 per share. Pfizer said that reflects its \"solid\" performance for the year, \"continued confidence in our business\" and progress with reducing costs, among other factors. Pfizer said it also includes a one-time $1.35 billion charge tied to its licensing agreement with Chinese biotech 3SBio, which hit earnings by roughly 20 cents per share. The company said its 2025 guidance also accounts for President Donald Trump's current tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. It does not reflect Trump's threatened pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, as the company is exempt from those levies for three years under a new drug pricing deal with the president.That agreement has no impact on Pfizer's 2025 guidance, but the company said it expects a dilutive effect to its 2026 outlook, its CFO Dave Denton said on a third-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Denton said the company will likely provide its 2026 guidance by the end of the year.Pfizer maintained it full-year revenue guidance of $61 billion to $64 billion.Shares of Pfizer rose more than 1% on Tuesday.Here's what the company reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 87 cents adjusted vs. 63 cents expectedRevenue: $16.65 billion vs. $16.58 billion expectedPfizer reported revenue of $16.65 billion for the third quarter, down 6% from the same period a year ago, largely because of lower demand for its Covid vaccine and Paxlovid, an antiviral pill for the virus. The company booked net income of $3.54 billion, or 62 cents per share. That compares with net income of $4.47 billion, or 78 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 87 cents for the quarter.Pfizer's \"performance continues to exceed expectations and deliver strong results, even as the incidence of Covid remains low,\" Denton said during the earnings call.Also on Tuesday, Pfizer said it's on track to cut costs by about $7.7 billion by the end of 2027 as part of two separate initiatives. As part of that, the company said it will slash costs by $4.5 billion by the end of 2025.The results come weeks after Pfizer became the first drugmaker to strike a deal with Trump to voluntarily sell its medications for less, as his administration pushes to link U.S. drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.Under the deal, Pfizer has agreed to a three-year grace period during which the company's products won't face Trump's threatened pharmaceutical-specific tariffs – as long as the drugmaker further invests in U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to invest $70 billion to reshore domestic drug manufacturing and research facilities.On the call, Denton said the deal \"will help ensure U.S. patients pay lower prices for prescription medicines while providing the clarity we need to focus on our business and our investment in future innovation.\"Pfizer is slowly regaining its footing after a rapid decline in its Covid business over the last three years, with the company betting on new ways to boost revenue, including through cancer products from its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen and a proposed deal with the obesity biotech Metsera.But the drugmaker is in a heated bidding war with Novo Nordisk for Metsera. Both pharmaceutical companies raised their bids for Metsera, but the biotech company on Tuesday said Novo Nordisk's new proposal is \"superior.\" That came one day after Pfizer filed its second lawsuit against the two companies, alleging that Novo Nordisk's attempt to outbid Pfizer to acquire Metsera is anticompetitive.\"We believe that Novo Nordisk's offer is illusory, and cannot constitute a superior proposal under the terms of our merger agreement with Metsera because it violates antitrust law and there is a high risk it will never be consummated,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during the earnings call on Tuesday.\"What I can say is that our belief in the promise of the Pfizer and Metsera combination is strong and unwavering,\" he said.Shares of Pfizer are down 7% for the year.Weaker Covid product salesPfizer said its Covid products weighed on third-quarter sales, as lower infection rates reduced Paxlovid demand and a narrower vaccine recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. shrank the eligible population for the shot, called Comirnaty. In September, advisors to the CDC recommended that everyone consult a health-care provider when deciding whether to receive a shot – softer guidance to receive the jab than in previous years. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, has sought to rewrite the nation's immunization policies through a series of far-reaching actions.The company's Covid shot booked $1.15 billion in revenue for the third quarter, down 19% from the year-earlier period. Analysts expected the shot to bring in $1.13 billion in sales for the quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsPfizer's antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid posted $1.23 billion in sales for the third quarter, down 55% from the same period a year ago. Analysts expected the shot to rake in $1.37 billion in sales for the period, StreetAccount estimates said.The company said third-quarter sales were helped by higher revenues for several products, including its blood thinner Eliquis, which it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb. That drug drew $2.02 billion in sales, a 25% increase, topping analysts' estimates for the period, according to StreetAccount.Eliquis is among the first round of drugs that will face new negotiated prices in Medicare in 2026, due to a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act.Pfizer said its Vyndaqel drugs, which are used to treat a certain type of cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle, and its migraine treatment Nurtec also saw higher sales. Vyndaqel medicines posted $1.59 billion in sales, while Nurtec drew $412 million in revenue, both surpassing analysts' estimates for the period.",

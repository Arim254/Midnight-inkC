    "body": "For years, bedtime was the most stressful part of my day. No matter how early we started or how carefully I planned, evenings always felt chaotic.I've heard the same story from many of the parents I've worked with, and it's understandable. Bedtime is a major emotional transition that most of us were never taught how to navigate.But as a conscious-parenting researcher who has studied over 200 kids, I've noticed a clear pattern: The happiest, most emotionally well-rounded children have parents who follow a predictable routine that lowers anxiety and strengthens connection. Here's what they do differently.1. They let go of controlMany parents head into bedtime expecting resistance, and children can sense that tension almost immediately.Parents who experience smoother evenings aren't attached to how long the routine takes or how perfectly it unfolds. When you soften your grip on the outcome, your child's nervous system will follow.Remember, if bedtime takes 90 minutes instead of 30, but your child falls asleep feeling safe and calm, that's still a win.2. They connect before they disconnectStalling, clinging, tantrums and irritability at bedtime can be signs of separation anxiety. Parents who understand this slow down the final moments of the evening. They offer physical closeness or quiet presence before saying goodnight. Even 10 to 20 minutes of intentional connection can make a difference. From there, you can set clear but warm boundaries: \"I'm here with you now. After two books and a cuddle, it's time to turn the lights out.\"3. They remove pressure around sleepMany bedtime battles are simply about pressure. When children feel they're expected to \"fall asleep\" on command, their nervous systems shift into alert mode, making rest harder. Parents with the easiest nights stop making sleep the goal. They focus on creating calm conditions. This makes it more likely for our bodies to settle naturally.4. They build a bridge from night into morningTo a child, bedtime can feel like an abrupt ending. You can ease this transition by emphasizing what comes next: \"We'll finish this in the morning,\" or, \"We'll snuggle again when the sun comes up.\"This helps children experience bedtime as a pause, not a loss, reducing anxiety and resistance.Some parents also create this bridge by ending the night with a simple point of connection. They might ask, for example, \"What are you most excited for tomorrow?\" 5. They end the night by reinforcing safetySafety is the signal that tells a child's nervous system it can finally stop bracing and start resting. Without it, even the tiredest body stays alert.You can reinforce safety by saying things like: \"Today was hard. Tonight was hard. And I'm still here.\"\"You didn't have to be perfect today. You just had to be you.\"\"I'm here. You can rest.\" 6. They regulate their own emotionsFinally, and this might be the most important one: Emotionally attuned parents regulate themselves. Evenings are when you are most depleted and therefore most likely to react from stress rather than intention.So pause before engaging. Take a few deep breaths. Ask yourself whether you're carrying stress from the day into the moment. Settle yourself first, then support your child.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "There are two ways to get back to the level of home affordability Americans had for much of the last decade, according to Realtor.com. Neither looks realistic anytime soon.In 2019, the mortgage payment for a median-priced home took up about 21% of median household income. Today, it accounts for more than 30%, reflecting sharply higher home prices and mortgage rates that have nearly doubled since January 2022, according to a recent analysis from the real estate listings platform.Barring a sharp drop in home prices, Realtor.com calculates that getting monthly payments back to 2019 levels would require one of two things:Household incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 todayMortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% as of Feb. 6Neither option appears likely in the near term. Real median household income has risen only about 17% over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mortgage rates are more likely to ease from their current 30-year fixed rate, though most forecasts still have them hovering near 6% through 2026.Even at that level, affordability gains may be limited. The National Association of Realtors projects that home prices will rise about 4% in 2026 as renewed demand runs up against stubborn supply shortages.\"The U.S. housing market continues to grapple with a persistent mismatch between housing supply and buyer demand,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"If buyer demand strengthens without a corresponding increase in supply, renewed price growth is likely.\"Limited housing supply remains a challengeA chronic shortage of homes continues to weigh on housing affordability. There is a nationwide housing shortfall of nearly 4 million homes, Realtor.com estimates, a gap that helps explain why lower mortgage rates or stronger wage growth alone may not be enough to deliver substantial affordability gains.\"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. For costs to go down, the supply of homes has to better meet demand, he says.Supply has been slow to catch up in part because zoning rules and lengthy permitting processes often limit how much new housing can be built or where it can go, according to a separate Realtor.com report from 2025.Expanding housing supply through additional construction and policy changes remains critical to easing affordability pressures, particularly in supply-constrained markets, according to NAR.At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced bipartisan proposals aimed at zoning, permitting and construction bottlenecks, though most remain in early stages.More change is happening at the state level. Texas and California have passed laws to loosen zoning rules and streamline permitting, but the impact has been mixed so far.The timeline for closing the housing supply gap also varies sharply by region, according to a 2025 Realtor.com report. At the current pace of construction and household formation, the report estimates the supply gap could close within three years in the South and six and a half years in the West. The Midwest would need roughly four decades. In the Northeast, the gap would not close at all under current trends.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Playing for his fifth NFL team in eight years, 28-year-old quarterback Sam Darnold is preparing to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a potential championship title in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday — a moment that's required a high degree of mental resilience to reach, he told The Athletic on Friday.Darnold's career started with high expectations as the No. 3 draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Instead, he lost more games than he won over his first three seasons, got traded and ultimately served as a backup quarterback for multiple teams over multiple years. He won a starting job with the Minnesota Vikings in 2024 after his primary competition for the role suffered a season-ending knee injury, and to many pundits' surprise, led the Vikings to a 14-3 record that season.His performance led to a three-year contract with Seattle worth $100.5 million in March. Now on the precipice of an NFL championship, Darnold says the resilient mindset he first learned from his parents helped him overcome his own mistakes and self-doubt to resurrect his career.\"My dad worked as a plumber, and my mom is a PE teacher, and it never mattered what kind of day they had. They were always consistent for me and my sister,\" Darnold told The Athletic. \"[It] didn't matter what had happened at work; my dad was always out there playing catch with me afterwards. So, you know, I feel like I just naturally kind of learned to be resilient.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsDarnold still relies on his family to help him maintain a balanced mental state today, he said. \"I would say my family is a huge part in just my ability to get over things when it's bad, and they do a good job of keeping me grounded when things are good,\" said Darnold.Resilience is a key ingredient of success, psychologists agree: It helps us move on from mistakes while maintaining enough confidence to keep taking calculated risks. Teaching kids how to recover from failure and learn important lessons they can apply later on should be the goal of every parent who wants to raise mentally tough and resilient children, psychotherapist Amy Morin wrote for CNBC Make It in March 2021.\"The most accomplished people reached their goals by failing along the way,\" Morin wrote. \"Kids who do well later in life focus their attention on what went wrong and how they could fix it. They have growth mindsets that help them turn failures into positive learning experiences.\"A three-sentence mantra for resilienceEarly in his career, Darnold dwelled too much on his mistakes, he told Fox Sports in an interview that aired on Jan. 30. He'd allow his on-field performance to disproportionately affect his mood and overall mental health, he said.Reflecting on his parents' longtime mindset helped inspire the mental shift that Darnold credits with helping turn his career around, he said. \"Sometimes, mistakes happen and you learn from it,\" he said. \"And you don't want to make the same mistakes again, but [if you have] a long career, those things are going to happen.\"Darnold also took inspiration from a quote from Jerry Rice, one of the greatest players in NFL history, he told The San Francisco Standard on Thursday.\"Jerry Rice said that he never had a perfect practice or a perfect game,\" said Darnold. \"That's the mindset I try to have. It's not always going to be perfect, [but] it's about how can you move on from mistakes to continue to better the team and better yourself.\"Now, rather than dwelling on mistakes — which are bound to happen, in some way — Darnold tries \"to flush bad plays, flush bad games\" from his memory and move on with his positive attitude intact, he told The Athletic.When things don't work out the way he'd planned, he turns to a mantra for resilience, he said: \"'That happens. It's football. We're not always going to be perfect.'\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, defense buyers at the Singapore Airshow say they are prioritizing sovereignty, from local production and co‑development to owning the software and intellectual property that run their systems. Industry leaders say that control over hardware, software and supply chains is now a central factor in procurement decisions.Executives at the show, which closes on Sunday, pointed to shifting alliances and tougher rhetoric from major powers as a catalyst for the trend. \"There is a notion that is coming around very explicitly ... the notion of sovereignty,\" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development at French aerospace and defense firm Thales, told CNBC.Sourisse added that this mindset has helped drive defense spending higher as countries conclude they must look after their own security.Chua Jin Kiat, executive vice president and head of international defense business at Singapore engineering and defense firm ST Engineering, echoed the sentiment, and said that over the last 12 months, U.S. President Donald Trump's combative stance toward allies has pushed countries to realize that \"we may not be able to depend on others.\"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has pushed its allies to spend more on defense, with NATO committing to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2035. Trump has threatened allies' such as Canada and most recently Denmark over its territory of Greenland. He has also reportedly said he would sell allies weaker versions of American weapons \"because someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"Chua added that countries are recognizing that old alliances and alignments may not be \"so enforceable or relevant\" anymore, even organizations such as NATO. \"So you can be a NATO member. But actually, at the end of the day today, what we are seeing is, first and foremost, if I'm Germany, I'm Germany. If I'm Finland, I'm Finland,\" he said. Supply chain resilienceA direct consequence of that shift is a renewed emphasis on boosting supply‑chain resilience. Companies told CNBC they are responding by localizing production, transferring know‑how, or partnering with domestic firms so customers can maintain and upgrade systems without long, fragile supply lines.Sourisse said Thales is not only marketing its solutions but also planning to localize activities and competencies. The company has set up joint labs in Singapore with local agencies to develop capabilities on the ground.ST Engineering's Chua said the company, constrained by Singapore's limited land area available for large factories, prefers co‑production arrangements overseas. For example, if ST Engineering can make advanced vehicles in a country with more space for production plants than Singapore, the company would collaborate and teach them how to build them in a co-production effort.\"For many of the big primes, they have to keep their factories at home running. They have got huge production plants, thousands of jobs, and the lights have to be kept on constantly.\"New kids on the blockSovereignty extends beyond factories to software and intellectual property. Newer firms in the defense tech space are becoming aware of those demands and are structuring deals accordingly.U.S.- based Shield AI, which develops autonomous warfare systems, signed a memorandum of understanding at the airshow to integrate its Hivemind autonomy software across selected ST Engineering platforms. Shield AI X-bat flight renderingShield AIThe company had earlier in 2025 partnered with the Republic of Singapore Air Force to use Hivemind to enhance the RSAF's autonomous capabilities.Brandon Tseng, co‑founder of Shield AI, told CNBC that Hivemind enables other companies and militaries to develop their own artificial-intelligence pilots locally, and Singapore would own that intellectual property. \"They can build AI pilots for whatever they want to do. We don't own [the IP],\" he told CNBC. Tseng added that while countries will continue to buy some foreign hardware, many want to indigenize critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy.",

Photographer: Toru Hanai/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has likely strengthened its majority in the country's Lower House, with the LDP capturing between 274 and 328 in the 465 seat chamber, according to an early projection by broadcaster NHK. This was broadly in line with what polls had suggested, with Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun predicting that the LDP and its coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party would secure more then 300 seats in the Lower House. NHK projected the coalition would win up to 366 seats.People trudged through heavy snow in several parts of the country to cast their votes.Before parliament was dissolved, the LDP-JIP coalition held a combined 230 seats, and with three independents voting with the LDP, this effectively gave the ruling coalition a one seat majority in the chamber. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female leader, dissolved the Lower House on Jan. 23, a move that was seen as an attempt to quickly strengthen the ruling coalition's position in the chamber by capitalizing on her high public approval ratings. \"Takaichi now has the LDP and the technocrats exactly where she always wanted them,\" economist Jesper Koll said in a Substack post.\"The LDP is now beholden to her; and the elite technocrats now know she'll be in power for at least two or three more years … so they have no choice but to invest their career in her success,\" Koll added.OSAKA, JAPAN - FEBRUARY 08: Election staff members count votes at a ballot counting center on February 08, 2026 in Osaka, Japan.

(Photo by Buddhika Weerasinghe/Getty Images)Buddhika Weerasinghe | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPolls compiled by Japanese media outlet Nippon.com showed that Takaichi remained popular heading into the election, although her support had slipped slightly in the recent weeks. The outlet reported that just one domestic poll in January indicated more than 70% support, compared to three in December, while six polls showed support in the 60% range, up from four in the previous month. Meanwhile, the Central Reform Alliance, made up of the former Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner, was likely to pick up between 37 and 91 seats. The CDP was the largest opposition party before its merger with Komeito, holding 148 seats, while Komeito controlled 24 seats.Economic and geopolitical challengesThe election comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and China, as well as persistent concerns over the yen's weakness and inflation in the country.Japan has endured inflation above the Bank of Japan's target for 45 consecutive months, declining real wages and persistent yen weakness.The most recent inflation reading stood at 2.1%, while full-year inflation reached 3.2%. Real wages fell for 11 consecutive months year-on-year in 2025, and on a yearly basis, real wages have fallen every year since 2022.The yen weakened further at the start of 2026, briefly approaching the 160 level against the U.S. dollar. While a weaker currency benefits exporters, it has also amplified imported inflation.Takaichi had earlier laid out a record $783 billion budget for the next fiscal year starting April 1, on top of a $135 billion stimulus package introduced last year to help households with rising living costs.\"Watch for more state-directed initiatives to create 'national champions', levering the $550 [billion] U.S.-Japan investment deal to create a sense of urgency amongst reluctant CEOs,\" Koll said. \"Japan's M&A boom will get turbo-charged to create greater economies of scale, and thus more credible global competitiveness — all this in the name of higher national economic security.\" -- Azhar Sukri contributed to this storyStock Chart IconStock chart iconUSDJPY=",

We remain committed to the millions of Americans who depend on us for access to safe, affordable, and personalized care.\"Hims & Hers had previously said it planned to create a cheaper, copycat version of pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss pill. That treatment — featuring Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide — was set to launch for as little as $49 for the first month. Novo's pill sells for roughly $100 more.Novo on Thursday threatened legal action against Hims for what it called \"illegal mass compounding,\" adding that the company planned to take legal and regulatory action. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement at the time.On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in, announcing it planned to take legal action against Hims & Hers for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice.In response, Hims on Saturday said it \"has always operated with a deep commitment to the safety and best interests of consumers and in compliance with applicable law.\"The move comes as the company plans to run an advertisement during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. The ad features rapper Common voicing the message that \"America's wealth gap has turned into a health gap.\" Hims previously said it expects the ad to \"ruffle some feathers.\"",

    "body": "A Western Digital office building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake | Reuters The latest earnings reports from major technology companies have revived investors' concerns about payoffs on elevated artificial intelligence (AI) spending. While some companies failed to impress investors, others proved their ability to capitalize on solid growth opportunities offered by the ongoing AI boom.With their expertise and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors select stocks that can outperform the broader market and deliver impressive growth. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AppleiPhone maker Apple (AAPL) is this week's first pick. In a recent research note, Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated a buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of $330. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AAPL stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $289. The five-star analyst noted that Apple's January App Store revenue rose 7% year over year. However, Daryanani pointed out that Gaming revenues fell on a year-over-year basis for a third consecutive month, with January revenues down 3%. He explained that this weakness was due to tougher year-over-year comparisons. He expects Gaming revenues to see easier comparisons through the rest of the first half of calendar year 2026. Daryanani highlighted that despite ongoing weakness in the Gaming category, revenues from the other five categories of App Store revenue grew by double digits, led by Music (up 21%), Other (21%), Photo and Video (18%), Social Networking (11%) and Entertainment (10%).The analyst stated that Apple continues to deliver robust growth in Services revenue despite subdued App Store data, with the December quarter seeing 14% growth compared to the App Store's 6.5% growth. Daryanani also noted that Apple's recently reported revenue and EPS (earnings per share) for the December quarter exceeded expectations, with the company delivering better-than-expected gross margin, driven by limited memory impact and robust Services growth. \"We expect AAPL to continue to benefit from faster growing areas (Apple Pay, iCloud, Licensing, etc.), helping to offset <10% growth in App Store revs,\" said Daryanani. Daryanani ranks No. 160 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.6%. See Apple Options Activity on TipRanks. MongoDBDatabase software provider MongoDB (MDB) is next on the list. Bank of America analyst Koji Ikeda is optimistic about the company's growth prospects. He recently reaffirmed a buy rating on MDB stock and raised his price forecast to $500 from $480. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MongoDB stock with a price target of $380. Commenting on concerns over whether MongoDB's Atlas revenue growth will keep accelerating, Ikeda sees the potential for continued strength. His optimism is backed by the success of the company's top-down enterprise and bottom-up product-led growth approach and an expanding product lineup for artificial intelligence (AI) and legacy app modernization. The analyst also expects MongoDB to gain from higher consumption, driven by rising enterprise workloads. Ikeda highlighted the strengths of MongoDB database, saying it is fast, scalable and document-based, differentiating it from conventional relational databases like Oracle. The five-star analyst also noted the new features offered by the company, including vector search and application modernization capabilities, which bolster its position to win additional workloads.While MDB stock is trading at a higher valuation compared to infrastructure software peers, Ikeda believes that a premium is justified, given the 30% Atlas growth compared to 11% for peers and MongoDB's leading position in the database market. Ikeda ranks No. 689 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See MDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Western Digital Data storage company Western Digital (WDC) recently announced better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and issued solid guidance. The robust demand for hard drives and flash storage amid the ongoing AI wave is boosting the company's business. Following Western Digital's Innovation Day, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan reaffirmed a buy rating on WDC stock with a price target of $345. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on Western Digital with a price target of $285. Mohan noted that Western Digital expects the AI and cloud storage market to grow exabytes (EB), a measure of data storage, at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of over 25% through 2030. The five-star analyst also sees the possibility of hard disk drives (HDDs) gaining market share and accounting for more than 80% of storage in the cloud. Additionally, Mohan emphasized Western Digital's revised long-term growth targets. Over the next three to five years, the company aims to grow its nearline exabytes at mid-20% CAGR, with overall revenue above 20% CAGR. Mohan highlighted that a favorable mix shift to higher capacity HDDs, stable pricing, and a focus on cost improvements could fuel gross margin above 50%, an operating margin of more than 40%, and EPS higher than $20. Meanwhile, Western Digital is planning capital spending at 4% to 6% of annual revenue and a free cash flow margin of more than 30%. Overall, Mohan is bullish on WDC's prospects based on \"secular growth of the HDD market,\" as well as further gross margin upside.Mohan ranks No. 110 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.1%. See Western Digital Financials on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: Appian Corp. (APPN) Business: Appian provides business process management (BPM) solutions. Its products include BPM software, case management, mobile application development and platform-as-a-service. The company was founded by Matthew Calkins, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson and Michael Beckley in 1999 and is headquartered in McLean, Va.Stock Market Value: $1.86B ($25.21 per share)Activist: Fivespan PartnersOwnership: 7.91%Average Cost: $29.73 Activist Commentary: Fivespan Partners, LP is a San Francisco-based investment firm founded in October 2023 by Dylan Haggart and Sarah Coyne. Prior to Fivespan, Haggart and Coyne were partners at ValueAct Capital and 80% of the investment team is from ValueAct. Fivespan, named after the unique five-stone arched bridge in Haggart's hometown, views itself as a bridge between the market and companies. The firm prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism, but it would resort to a proxy fight if there were no other choice. We expect that Fivespan will look for board seats in situations where it believes it could add real value, but we do not expect the firm to pursue board representation as often as ValueAct does (i.e, in roughly 50% of core portfolio positions). Haggart has experience as a public company director. He served as a director of Seagate (2018-present) and Fiserv (2022-2024), where he delivered stellar returns over his tenures of 205.25% and 64.68%, respectively, versus 46.12% and 4.98% for the Russell 2000. Fivespan looks for high quality, idiosyncratic businesses with good, strategic assets. The firm does not advocate for selling its portfolio companies as a primary activist strategy, but it likes companies that people want to own. Accordingly, many of its activist campaigns could end with a sale of the company, providing two paths to shareholder value. The fund is a drawdown structure that holds investments for at least three to five years, aims to have six to eight investments at a time and averages $100 million to $300 million in each investment.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Fivespan announced that it will continue meeting with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board.Behind the scenesAppian provides mission critical business process and management software solutions to some of the largest, most complex enterprises in the world. Its customer base consists primarily of legacy businesses that operate outdated backend technology stacks, including large banks, telecom companies and even the Department of Defense. Appian's software is deeply embedded into these companies' systems, resulting in extremely high switching costs. As a result, customers hardly ever leave, with gross retention at approximately 99%. Moreover, Appian and its peers have penetrated only about 10% of what could be a $90 billion market. As a result, the company benefits from consistent mid-teens revenue growth, mostly from new business with current clients. Despite this compelling backdrop, Appian shares trade at roughly 2-times sales and 3-times gross profit – more than a 50% discount to similarly situated peers.With Appian's stock down 89% over the past five years, Fivespan Partners has entered the picture filing a 13D disclosing a 6.16% position in Appian and announced that it will continue to have meetings with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board. Any changes made or board representation would have to come at the invitation of the current board as Appian is effectively a controlled company. Appian co-founder CEO, chairman, and president Matthew Calkins controls about 39% of the voting power, two of the other three founders are on the nine-person board with many other directors being former employees of Appian or having relationships with Calkins. But that is OK. Going back to his ValueAct days, Dylan Haggart has had a lot of experience and success working with controlled companies like KKR and The New York Times, the latter of which is also a current Fivespan portfolio position.There are at least three solvable issues that have driven Appian's discount. First is that the market has a fundamental misconception around Appian's artificial intelligence risk. As is the problem with many software companies, Appian has been broadly categorized as an \"automation\" company, leading it to be lumped in with businesses genuinely exposed to AI disruption, such as customer service or chatbot-driven automation. Appian's automation, however, is entirely different, as it is focused on creating and implementing complex backend processes. Nevertheless, this branding has forced it to be painted with the same brush, and in today's market, anything associated with automation is being sold off indiscriminately. Anyone who looks at Appian's financials' can recognize the fallacy of this bear case, as the company's growth and retention metrics look nothing like those of companies with actual AI risk. The problem here is that Appian has thus far failed to communicate this to the market. The company's four founders – Matthew Calkins, Michael Beckley, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson – are tech guys, mostly college buddies who started this company out of a garage. These are not guys who want to talk to the market, and the company's lack of an investor relations professional further underscores that. Thus, communicating this narrative to the market and perhaps even finding someone to fill this role for the company are both areas where Fivespan could add immediate value.Second is a lack of focus on margins. Historically, management, like many other growth companies, has prioritized top-line growth with limited attention to the company's profitability, leaving Appian's free cash flow margins in the low single digits, while comparable businesses like Pega generate margins north of 30%. With Fivespan now involved, this is likely to begin to change. Appian's recurring and sticky revenue model should allow them to pursue both revenue growth while expanding margins, by ensuring that incremental growth generates incremental profitability. While margins won't jump overnight, they should improve steadily each quarter as costs continue to grow more slowly than revenue, something we have observed from larger peers like Pega and ServiceNow. It is important to note that this is not a situation where layoffs and cost-cutting will lead to margin improvement, just being conscious of incremental costs as revenue increases should significantly benefit the bottom line.Lastly is capital allocation. As margins expand, Appian should become a cash cow, making disciplined capital allocation increasingly important for a company that hasn't had the strongest track record of doing so. This is where we see Haggart adding the most value. Some of the best activism occurs when a good activist gets on the board of a good company and management continues to do what they do best – run the business generating significant free cash flow, and an activist like Haggart does what he does best – help advise the board the best way to spend the cash flow to maximize shareholder value. This is one thing ValueAct is known for and that Haggart did extremely well at companies like Seagate. And this is an even more important skill to have on Appian's board, as the company is on the verge of coming into an at least $500 million windfall from a corporate espionage lawsuit filed against Pega. Appian sued Pega in 2020 and won a $2.036 billion verdict in 2022. The Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in 2024 and remanded it back to the lower court for a new trial. However, Appian had partly insured the verdict in the amount of $500 million, meaning that if it's ultimately awarded less than $500 million, the insurance company will make up the difference. If it's awarded more than $500 million, it is theirs to keep and the insurance company is off the hook. So, it is just a matter of time before Appian receives at least $500 million, which is more than 25% of the company's entire market cap.In the firm's other three campaigns, Fivespan has demonstrated that it prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism — and that's a good thing as it doesn't have any other choice here. However, while any strategic, operational, or governance changes are ultimately in the company's discretion, we think Appian and Fivespan are rowing in the same direction. Moreover, we think the company would benefit greatly from the addition of a minority shareholder representative on the board, like Haggart or another Fivespan executive. One of the benefits of having a hedge fund representative on the board is that the board not only gets the director's advice and counsel, but the resources of the entire firm and its team of analysts. This is particularly important when there are crucial capital allocation decisions to be made. Ultimately, this will be an activist-lite campaign and Haggart knows that he can only be effective here with the blessing and invitation of the founder. We expect he will proceed with that in mind.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday endorsed Nexstar Media's proposed $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, just months after criticizing the deal.\"We need more competition against THE ENEMY, the Fake News National TV Networks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"Letting Good Deals get done like Nexstar - Tegna will help knock out the Fake News because there will be more competition, and at a higher and more sophisticated level. Those that are opposed don't fully understand how good the concept of this Deal is for them, but they will in the future. GET THAT DEAL DONE!\"Under the agreement, Nexstar, which owns or partners with over 200 stations, would add Tegna's 64 stations — covering roughly 80% of the country. The deal, announced in August 2025, was expected to close in the second half of 2026. Trump's backing of the Nexstar-Tegna deal marks an abrupt turnaround. In a Truth Social post in November, Trump railed against the Nexstar-Tegna deal and the potential for more industry consolidation.\"If this would also allow the Radical Left Networks to 'enlarge,' I would not be happy,\" Trump wrote. \"ABC & NBC, in particular, are a disaster - A VIRTUAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. They should be viewed as an illegal campaign to the Radical Left. NO EXPANSION OF THE FAKE NEWS NETWORKS. If anything, make them SMALLER!\"Nexstar, Tegna and the White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The proposed Nexstar-Tegna deal is part of a string of recent media consolidation efforts as cord-cutting threatens the industry.\"We believe that broadcast news is essential to this country and a free democracy, independent local news, and that broadcast TV is basically the last bastion of local news at the local level, and our goal is to become a bigger company and hopefully be able to compete on a level playing field with Big Tech that is pervasive in all aspects of media,\" Nexstar CEO Perry Sook told CNBC after the deal announcement. watch nowCurrently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits a company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households to foster competition. For Nexstar's deal to go through, the FCC would have to lift that rule.\"We are focused on achieving deregulation, and we continue to advocate for the elimination of the antiquated constraints on local television ownership as the best solution to level the competitive playing field for all media,\" Sook said in a November release when requesting approval for the Tegna deal.In September, Nexstar was the first media company to preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after the late-night talk show's host made comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

The token rose to as much as $71,458.01 on Friday, up more than 11% on the day. It was last trading at $70,411.33 as of 3:16 p.m. ET. The forceful rebound followed the flagship cryptocurrency's dive below $61,000 on Thursday, marking a 15% plunge on the day. It comes as some investors are snapping up bitcoin after its more than 50% decline from its record high above $126,000 hit last October. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 5 daysThe reversal comes as stocks also rose on Friday, suggesting the market could close on a more positive note following a very volatile week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 918 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 added 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.5%.Investors' rotation back into risk-on assets drove stocks' surge amid fading fears over the threats posed by artificial intelligence technologies' to software firms. Several BigTech names rebounded, including Nvidia and Microsoft, which rose 6% and 1%, respectively. Those gains marked a stunning reversal from their near double-digit percentage point drops this week. Could bitcoin go lower again?Bitcoin is now trading close to its critical $70,000 level, sitting 45% off its all-time high. However, analysts said that bitcoin's earlier drop below $70,000 could signal further downside. watch nowOne firm, 10X Research, estimates bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon, Thielen said.\"I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,\" Thielen said. \"But I think during the summer we make another low.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares closed up nearly 8% on Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

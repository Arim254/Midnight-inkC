    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore's economy expanded 5.7% year on year for the fourth quarter, the highest since 2021, driven mainly by a sharp increase in manufacturing output during the three months through December.The Ministry of Trade and Industry said that Singapore's manufacturing sector posted a 15% expansion, a massive jump compared to the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. Growth during the quarter was largely driven by the biomedical manufacturing and electronics clusters, the ministry said.Manufacturing makes up about 20% of the city-state's GDP.Most other sectors contracted during the quarter, including construction and services.The advance estimate was higher than the revised 4.3% growth in the previous quarter, lifting full-year GDP growth to 4.8%, as announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his New Year's message. The 4.8% growth had surpassed the country's Ministry of Trade and Industry's upgraded forecast of \"around 4%\" in November. \"This is a better outcome than we expected, given the circumstances,\" Wong said, while warning that sustaining the current pace of growth would be challenging.Singapore's MTI had forecast a GDP growth figure of about 1%-3% for 2026. Selena Ling, Chief Economist & Head of Group Research & Strategy at OCBC, said that Singapore's GDP performance \"showcased economic resilience through broad-based and diversified strengths in manufacturing, services, and construction.\"Ling projected GDP growth of about 2% in 2026, assuming manufacturing growth eases to around 2.2% year on year due to a high base in 2025.Singapore had earlier cautioned that 2025 would be challenging, citing trade risks after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration slapped trade tariffs on dozens of countries in his \"Liberation Day\" on April.Despite having a free trade agreement with the U.S. since 2004, Singapore was hit with the 10% baseline tariff. Wong said at the time that \"these are not actions one does to a friend.\"Singapore is highly dependent on trade, with its trade-to-GDP ratio exceeding 320% in 2024, according to data from the World Bank.The country also warned in April last year that zero growth was a possibility and eased monetary policy twice in 2025 to prepare for a slowdown.

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications. Read moreTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A pedestrian passes in front of the Saks Fifth Avenue Inc. women's store at Brookfield Place in New York, U.S.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSaks Global named a new CEO on Friday as the retailer is reportedly on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection.The parent of high-end department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which is privately held, will now be led by Richard Baker, the company's executive chairman, Saks said in a news release. He will continue to hold the executive chairman role.With the shakeup, three-decade long Saks executive Marc Metrick will leave the company. The news release said Metrick's is departing \"to pursue new opportunities.\"In a statement, Baker said he will work \"to secure a strong and stable future for our company.\"\"Across Saks Global, with our deep industry expertise, well-established relationships within the luxury sector, and talented employees, we will strengthen our position so that we can capitalize on the many opportunities we see for our company in the luxury market,\" he said.Saks is preparing to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its 2024 acquisition of department store chain Neiman Marcus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.It's the latest twist in the luxury department store operator's effort to regain its financial footing. Saks Global was created in 2024 after Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Company acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion. By marrying the two luxury chains, it sought to better compete with other retailers and department stores including Nordstrom and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's.The deal turned Saks Global into a larger player, which included Saks Fifth Avenue, its off-price chain Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus' namesake department store chain and Bergdorf Goodman. Yet the company has taken clear steps to raise cash and shore up its finances, including the recent sale of Neiman Marcus' Beverly Hills flagship and Saks Global's debt restructuring in August 2025.In his biography on Saks Global's website, the company credited Baker for leading the acquisition of Neiman Marcus and described his strong real estate background. Baker is an owner of National Realty & Development Corporation, one of the largest real estate development companies in the United States, and he previously served as the chairman of the board of directors for Retail Opportunity Investments Corporation, which he also converted into a real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq.

    "body": "watch nowTesla posted its fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday, marking a second annual decline for Elon Musk's automaker.Here are the key numbers:Total Q4 deliveries:  418,227 Total Q4 production:  434,358 Total 2025 deliveries: 1.64 millionTotal 2025 production: 1.65 millionWall Street expected 426,000 deliveries for the quarter, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. In a company-compiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29, Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15% drop from a year earlier to 422,850 vehicles.Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570. Q4 2025 numbers for production were down 5.5% from a year ago, when Tesla produced 459,445 vehicles.For the full year, Tesla's deliveries fell 8.6% to 1.64 million from 1.79 million in 2024.Tesla said deliveries of its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV amounted to 406,585 in the fourth quarter, or about 97% of total deliveries. Deliveries of its Model S, Model X and Cybertruck vehicles came in at 11,642 during the quarter. After its design debut, Tesla boasted about more than 1 million reservations flooding in for the Cybertruck. The angular, steel pickup has yet to be a best seller for the company. Musk's aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, reportedly purchased tens of millions of dollars worth of Cybertrucks in 2025.Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China's BYD, South Korea's Kia and Hyundai, and Volkswagen in Europe, among others.BYD topped Tesla as the world's biggest seller of EVs in a calendar year, saying in a statement Thursday that sales grew 28% to 2.26 million units.Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.In its energy business, Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter, following a record in the prior period, when it deployed 12.5 GWh. Tesla's battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities. Tesla will report its fourth-quarter financial results on Jan. 28.Sales of Tesla's cars were impacted by President Donald Trump's decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30, earlier than previously planned. The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers. Even before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president's DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. Musk also endorsed Germany's extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.Partly in response to Musk's incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn't fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.However, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.Shareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn't pass. Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn't require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work and that there are no limits on his political activity.

Tesla's European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.Some analysts project that sales of Tesla's more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.In a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption \"is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.\" Besides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.But Tesla is selling investors on Musk's vision of the future, or what he calls \"sustainable abundance,\" more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs.

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

    "body": "Still life of the big three injectable prescription weight loss medicines. Ozempic, Victoza and Wegovy. (Photo by: Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Ucg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's shift from a market darling to a serious underperformer has set the stage for a transitional 2026 as the Danish drugmaker fights to regain investor confidence in its weight loss business.Novo's stock just experienced the worst year on record since it began trading on the Copenhagen stock exchange over three decades ago. Multiple reasons lie behind the dramatic drop: a series of guidance cuts, strides by chief rival Eli Lilly, a leadership upheaval, and cheap copycat drugs flooding the crucial U.S. market.With just about a week to go until 2026, Novo announced that its new weight loss pill under the brand name Wegovy had been approved in the U.S., making it the first oral GLP-1 treatment approved for weight loss. It sent shares up nearly 10% as investors banked on Novo being able to, at least partly, hold Eli Lilly and others at bay.That \"early Christmas present,\" as one analyst called it, highlights many of the key themes Novo will have to face this year.From injectables to pillsNovo's position as the first company to launch an oral option could help it make up some of the ground it's lost over the past year in the GLP-1 space. Analysts mostly agreed that the Wegovy pill's approval was a big deal, even though many had already expected a positive decision before the end of the year. Eli Lilly is expected to get its own weight loss pill orforglipron approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by no later than the second quarter of this year, and investors will closely watch how that competition plays out.watch now\"This approval adds a layer to the whole obesity space in the future,\" Sydbank analyst Søren Løntoft Hansen told CNBC. \"It could be, potentially, a space where Novo Nordisk is maybe able to recapture market shares and maybe increase growth.\"Wegovy-in-a-pill, as Novo calls the oral version of the blockbuster injectable, has shown that patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over 64 weeks. Meanwhile, orforglipron, averages 12.4% over 72 weeks.\"Usually, you have to basically go for either convenience or efficacy when you're discussing pills versus injections – not in this case,\" Novo CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC's Charlotte Reed in November. \"Wegovy in a pill basically will have the same efficacy as its injectable counterpart. That's really exciting.\"The broad consensus is that pills will also be favored by consumers. They have added advantages such as not having to be stored cold like the injectable version, allowing for simpler distribution and ease of entering new markets.A shifting narrative?Eli Lilly's positioning of its rival drug Zepbound as the best treatment for achieving weight loss on the market for once-weekly injections has helped it succeed in capturing significant market share to surpass Novo's Wegovy.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's positioning has been different as they've often emphazised that treating obesity goes beyond losing weight. \"They want to tell a story about how obesity should be seen as a disease and how Wegovy affects obesity-related diseases,\" Sydbank's Hansen said.\"As we will build and buy assets, you will often see that these assets do multiple things,\" Doustdar said in early November. \"They address other co-morbidities. We have seen that with semaglutide; it helps liver, kidney, heart – that's fantastic – we should actually go and further develop those,\" he said in the context of the future focus of its pipeline.However, it seems that's not important to Americans or the market, according to Hansen. \"The fraction that prescribes Wegovy or obesity drugs in relation to obesity-related diseases is very small,\" he noted, adding that even if many patients don't necessarily want to lose more than 20% of their body weight, they at least want the opportunity to achieve that highest rate of weight loss.\"It seems like that drives the market, and if Novo Nordisk is able to tap into that story with the Wegovy pill, I think they are in a good place,\" Hansen said.Read moreNovo in late November said it filed for FDA approval of a higher dose of Wegovy injection of 7.2 mg, which could also play into a changing narrative. Trials have shown that the higher dose of Wegovy resulted in a 20.7% weight reduction on average — about the same as Lilly's Zepbound jab.The U.S. consumerThe increased focus on the direct-to-consumer market will be another key area to watch.The market for weight loss pharmaceuticals is uniquely consumer-driven, contrasting many other blockbuster drugs that are typically covered by health plans in the U.S. or national health systems in Europe.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board.\"Søren Løntoft HansenSydbank analystPresident Donald Trump's second term in office has brought several headaches for pharmaceutical companies, Novo included. Throughout the year, Trump has teased triple-digit tariffs unless pharma companies make significant investments in the U.S., and has also waged a war on high drug prices for Americans.The frustration that U.S. drug prices can be more than four times those in Europe isn't new. Last year, Novo's then-CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen testified at the U.S. Senate panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who called for the company to \"stop ripping us off\" with high drug prices.But Trump has taken it further, advocating a so-called \"Most Favored Nation\" pricing for medicines, whereby the U.S. price is set to the lowest level compared to other wealthy countries.In November, the Trump administration reached a deal with Novo and Lilly to lower prices of their bestselling GLP-1 medicines on both Medicare and Medicaid, as well as agreements to offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the website TrumpRx.gov, which is set to be launched in January this year.The new direct-to-patient market is emerging as a critical driver of future sales growth, but compounders — which make cheaper copycat versions of the drug and were able to flourish during the earlier shortage of semaglutide — remain a real competitor.\"The TrumpRx deal will help Novo become more competitive with compounders on price, although a faster orforglipron launch could reduce its ability to gain momentum in the [direct-to-patient] channel ahead of Lilly,\" noted Morningstar's Karen Andersen.\"We've already seen the direct-to-patient market beginning to develop nicely in 2025, particularly for LillyDirect… oral GLP-1 drugs will be even better suited to this channel,\" she added. \"That will further push the market toward cash pay.\"Headwinds Investors are also waiting to see if Novo's new leadership will deliver on its attempt to improve U.S. operations.In May, Novo ousted its CEO of eight years, citing \"recent market challenges\" and \"the development of the company's share price.\" Six months later, all independent members of the board stepped down due to a disagreement with Novo's controlling shareholder over the pace of change and discontent over how it had addressed challenges in the U.S. market.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board,\" Hansen said, adding that the development in the U.S. market is a \"show me case\" for investors. \"Right now, we really don't see any significant positive progress here,\" he told CNBC on Dec 23.The Danish drugmaker must therefore balance progress on its pill version and higher-dose jabs of Wegovy with these multiple headwinds in 2026. Lower pricing for both the Medicare and consumer cash-pay channel as a result of MFN, as well as patent expiries in jurisdictions including Brazil, Canada and China will \"probably lead to a decreasing top line,\" said Hansen.Furthermore, 2026 will likely bring more clarity on Novo's next-generation drug CagriSema, which combines semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, with cagrilintide, an amylin analogue.watch nowLonger term, competition is likely to intensify beyond Lilly and compounders, as several drugmakers — including Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Roche — advance late-stage candidates through their pipelines.The future could also bring more diversification in treatments, as many new drugs are in development that could yield new ways to manage weight loss long-term, provide better safety profiles, and combine drugs that target several different appetite-modifying hormones.\"There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company – for example, reaching a deal with Hims and then terminating the deal… negotiating to acquire Metsera, exiting negotiations, and then jumping back in after a signed Pfizer deal,\" said Andersen.\"This [Wegovy pill approval] win is symbolically very important for Novo, after a series of disappointments with data and financial performance,\" she added. \"It needed a win, and now it just needs to execute.\"",

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish renewables giant Orsted, the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, said on Friday that it had launched legal action against the Trump administration over the suspension of its $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company rose more than 4% on the news, putting the stock among the top performers of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.  Orsted said in a statement that it would seek a court injunction against the U.S. government's decision to halt its Revolution Wind project, located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast.\"As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project … faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project,\" Orsted said. \"Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process,\" the company added.The pro-fossil fuel Trump administration suspended leases on Dec. 22 for five large offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. The move marked the latest in a string of blows against offshore wind developers, with U.S. President Donald Trump having previously described wind turbines as \"ugly\" and an economic and environmental \"disaster.\" Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCBerkshire Hathaway shares slipped Friday as investors digested the formal end of Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as chief executive and the start of a new era under successor Greg Abel.Class A shares fell 1.7% in afternoon trading on Abel's first day as CEO, following Buffett's official handoff of the role and the close of one of the most storied leadership tenures in corporate history. The Omaha-based conglomerate ended 2025 with a gain of 10.9%, trailing the S&P 500's 16.4% advance but marking its 10th consecutive year of positive returns. Buffett, 95, remains chairman and has sought to reassure shareholders that Berkshire's future extends well beyond his tenure.\"It has a better chance, I think, of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett said in a special interview with CNBC. Abel takes over as Berkshire sits on a record $381.6 billion in cash as of the end of September, following an extended period of net equity selling. Buffett has said Abel will have final authority over capital allocation decisions.\"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares lagged the broader market after Buffett announced his retirement in May, as some investors weighed whether Abel could oversee the conglomerate's vast operating businesses and equity portfolio with the same touch, while still justifying a premium valuation.Buffett departs with an unmatched record. After taking control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, he turned a struggling textile maker into a compounding powerhouse. From 1964 through 2024, Berkshire delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent.",

    "body": "A new year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial habits and make small changes that can have a big impact. For over a decade, I've worked with clients navigating life transitions, like divorce and retirement, to help them forge their new financial paths. In my experience, there are six money personalities that represent the ways that people's money beliefs and attitudes play out in daily life. Here's my best money advice for each personality going into 2026: 1. The GiverThe Giver has a heart of gold and a generous spirit. Whether helping a friend in need, contributing to a worthy cause, or lending a hand to a stranger down on their luck, the Giver is always there. But this can lead to overspending, neglected personal financial needs, and even feelings of resentment.My best money advice for 2026For the Giver, the key is finding balance. With thoughtful planning and increased awareness of when to say no, you can continue to support others without jeopardizing your financial situation. When you find yourself in a pinch, remember that there are many ways to fill others' cups — as well as your own — that don't cost a dime. In fact, often your time and talents can make an even greater impact than your treasures.2. The TrailblazerTrailblazers don't follow the herd — they lead it. They exude confidence and embrace thoughtful risks. They are driven, focused, and relentless in their pursuit of success. But here's the twist: Their fierce independence can lead to burnout and a reluctance to ask for help.My best money advice for 2026While a Trailblazer may excel at creating wealth, managing it requires a much different skill set. It's important to learn how to delegate. By recognizing your limitations and leveraging the expertise of others, you can maximize the potential of your hard-earned money. This will ultimately reduce stress and enhance your overall financial success — allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor.3. The SkepticMoney? Nah, that's for the fat cats and money-grubbers. The Skeptic's mistrust can stunt their financial progress. They often feel caught between believing they don't deserve wealth and panicking at the thought of pursuing it. The result? They continue to repeat behaviors that leave them feeling financially insecure.My best money advice for 2026Writing down all your positive qualities can help you see that your worth isn't tied to your bank account. Surround yourself with people who are financially successful — as well as kind and generous — to help reshape your views on money. Witnessing how wealth can be used for good might help dismantle the assumption that it inherently breeds greed.4. The High RollerHigh Rollers live for the moment! Fancy things light them up. Saving for the future? Not so much. Their emotions can lead to impulsive purchases, and they can easily lose track of spending — which may result in a pile of debt. This constant pursuit of pleasure can cause the High Roller to feel empty inside. My best money advice for 2026Exploring how you cope with emotions, like boredom or anxiety, can help reduce impulse purchases. Budgeting apps or spending trackers, along with thoughtful discussions about the relationship between self-worth and material things, can help build self-awareness around spending habits. Transitioning to a cash-only system can also be a powerful tool for you — limiting your ability to rely on credit cards when you're tempted to splurge.5. The Penny PincherThe Penny Pincher is a perpetual saver, regardless of how much they have in the bank. They are disciplined and resourceful when it comes to spending (which is a good thing!) and often feel guilty after making a purchase — even when it's a necessity. Typically, they are debt- and risk-averse and fear losing it all, which can cause them to miss out on opportunities to effectively grow their wealth or benefit from valuable experiences.My best money advice for 2026Learning the basics of investing can empower the Penny Pincher to take calculated risks. Setting specific spending goals — like taking a dream vacation or planning fun nights out with friends — can help you shift your focus from what you might lose to what your money can help you gain and experience. This approach can build confidence and create a more balanced perspective.6. The AvoiderThe Avoider would rather not think about money, let alone talk about it. They typically have no idea where they stand financially. And frankly, most don't know where to start. But the more they avoid their situation, the more anxious they become.My best money advice for 2026Even the smallest actions can spark change. Dedicating just 10 minutes each week to reviewing your account balances, exploring your spending, or asking for help can empower you to confront your financial situation with less stress. Additionally, seeking resources like online articles, podcasts, or financial literacy classes can help you take actionable steps to improve your financial well-being.Keep in mindThese aren't meant to be reductive labels but rather lenses that build awareness of your current habits. Remember:These aren't rigid categories. Your behavior with money can change over time as life experiences shape new financial habits.Growth is always possible. Recognizing your tendencies empowers you to make intentional shifts and cultivate healthier behaviors.Identifying with multiple types is typical. It's common to exhibit traits from more than one personality type.And of course, you may want to seek personalized financial advice that's tailored to your specific needs.Steph Wagner is a nationally recognized thought leader in women's wealth and financial empowerment who serves as the National Director of Women & Wealth at Northern Trust.

    "body": "watch nowThe Russian-U.S. national who hacked crypto exchange Bitfinex and stole nearly 120,000 bitcoin said he has been freed from prison early thanks to the bipartisan prison-reform law signed by President Donald Trump.Ilya Lichtenstein, 38, had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a money laundering conspiracy charge and admitting to the hack of crypto assets now valued in the billions of dollars.But late Thursday night, a post on Lichtenstein's official X account declared, \"Thanks to President Trump's First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.\"Courtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in federal court in Washington.Artist: William Hennessey\"I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,\" Lichtenstein's post said. \"To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.\"A Trump administration official told CNBC on Friday morning that Lichtenstein \"has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.\"Attorneys for Lichtenstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his release.Lichtenstein's wife, Heather Morgan — who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen funds — shared Lichtenstein's message on her own X account, saying, \"The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart.\"Morgan's tweet, posted two minutes after Lichtenstein's, included a photo of the couple smiling for a selfie.Lichtenstein's sentence included credit for time he already served in custody following his arrest in 2022, more than five years after Bitfinex was hacked.As of Friday morning, a search for Lichtenstein's name using the federal government's inmate locator website returned one result showing Lichtenstein is scheduled to be released on Feb. 9.The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Booking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein.Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.Morgan, 35, a rapper who releases music under the name \"Razzlekhan\" and also went by \"The Crocodile of Wall Street,\" was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration shortly after Lichtenstein received his prison sentence.She entered prison in February. But on Oct. 26, Morgan posted a video of herself saying she had been released early.She also thanked Trump.\"Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,\" Morgan said in the clip, in which she appears in a bathtub wearing only a hair towel.\"It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,\" she said.

The legislation aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population through a series of reforms, including by establishing a \"a risk and needs assessment system\" that gives some inmates the chance of early release into home confinement.It is unclear whether Trump or the White House had any direct involvement in Lichtenstein or Morgan securing an early prison release. But the announcements from the bitcoin hacker and his wife follow a number of high-profile cybercrime-related pardons and commutations that have been doled out by the crypto friendly president since his return to office.One day after his inauguration, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.In October, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of major crypto exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai waves as he arrives at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit at the Grand Palais in Paris, Feb. 11, 2025.Benoit Tessier | ReutersAfter a tough start to the year, Google closed out 2025 with its strongest performance — from Wall Street's perspective — since 2009, when the company's shares doubled coming out of the financial crisis. Alphabet's stock popped 65% for the year, slightly ahead of its gains in 2021. The shares hit their 2025 low in April, as President Donald Trump was threatening massive tariffs on trading partners, but they've since jumped over 100%. Among the eight tech companies valued at over $1 trillion, Alphabet was by far the biggest gainer. The next sharpest rallies came from chipmakers Broadcom and Nvidia, which gained 49% and 39%, respectively. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. the Nasdaq in 2025Getting to this point required Google to stare down the skeptics, who questioned whether the search giant could maintain its dominance in the artificial intelligence era. With OpenAI's ChatGPT and Sora services capturing an increasing amount of consumer engagement and concerns swirling around the future of online advertising in a world of AI chatbots and agents, Google's business model was viewed as a target for major disruption. Alphabet's 18% plunge in the first quarter was its worst period for the stock since mid-2022. But the mood started to improve in the second quarter. In April, the company promoted 16-year company veteran Josh Woodward to run the Gemini app, Google's answer to ChatGPT. In August, Woodward's group debuted image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users turn to AI to generate images. The feature went viral at launch when people used it to blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. By the end of the following month, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Google's AI talent pool deepened over the summer, when the company announced an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior research and development employees from the high-profile startup that had previously been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition. That deal fell apart, and Google ended up agreeing to pay $2.4 billion in licensing fees and for compensation to snag Windsurf's top engineers. Winning in AI and in courtSoon thereafter, Google was handed a gift in the courtroom.Despite losing its antitrust case last year, as Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in September against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the Justice Department. Google would not have to divest Chrome and could still make payments to companies to preload products, meaning it could continue paying Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on iPhones. One consequence of the ruling is that Google would have to share certain data with competitors. Gemini's momentum has been the biggest story.Last month, Google announced Gemini 3, an upgraded AI model, almost eight months after rolling out Gemini 2.5.While Gemini still trails ChatGPT in overall usage, it's been rapidly making up ground. According to data this month from Similarweb, ChatGPT's share of generative AI traffic dropped to about 68% from 87% a year earlier, while Gemini jumped to roughly 18% from about 5% over that stretch. watch nowAnalysts at Citizens wrote in a Tuesday report that the critical development for Alphabet isn't just about Gemini but the effect of the company's AI investments on the core search business. AI Overviews is Google's search-embedded service that provides AI-powered summaries for user queries. The Citizens analysts said the \"incorporation of updated models is improving the relevance of answers, which we view as a further tailwind to engagement.\"\"We come away believing Google can further accelerate search revenue in 4Q25, which we view as the key question near term,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the shares even after the latest rally. Analysts have also highlighted Google's broad strength in cloud computing, where it's chasing Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and the company's leadership in robotaxis through Waymo as potential catalysts heading into 2026. Still, with investors piling into the stock, expectations are sky-high. Analysts project fourth-quarter revenue growth of 15% to over $111 billion when Alphabet next reports results, according to LSEG, and growth throughout next year is expected to be in the low teens.In October, Alphabet raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as high as $93 billion, up from $85 billion. Analysts see that number jumping to more than $114 billion in 2026, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. He said on the October earnings call that Google's cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter than in the two prior years combined. Analysts at Pivotal Research warned in a note to clients earlier this month that should OpenAI, one of Google's key customers, cut its spending or face other issues due to its mounting obligations, \"it is likely to temporarily get pretty ugly for AI stocks and the market in general.\"But the Pivotal analysts have a buy rating on the stock and raised their price target by $50, to $400, about 28% above Wednesday's closing price of $313.\"We believe the shakeout, if it happens, will mirror 2000 and will inevitably be a healthy weeding out process leaving fewer much more dominant competitors, with GOOG leading the way,\" they wrote. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "After 60 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett stepped down as the holding company's CEO at the end of 2025. Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

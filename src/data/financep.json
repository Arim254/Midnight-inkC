    "body": "Carles Reina, GTM manager at Eleven Labs, shared why he invested in AI company.Eleven LabsThe angel investor who backed a billion-dollar AI startup when it was still in its infancy said he decided to invest in the company after just 30 minutes of meeting one of its founders.Carles Reina first decided to invest in AI voice startup Eleven Labs in 2022, when he was a venture partner at pre-seed fund Concept Ventures.Co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, Eleven Labs specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology. In its January Series C funding round earlier this year, the company raised $180 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion.Then in September, the company announced it was letting employees sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation.However, before Eleven Labs even had a concrete product, Reina, who was working at Palantir Technologies at the time, decided to take a chance on the firm after meeting Staniszewski.\"I met Mati when he was still at Palantir,\" Reina told CNBC Make It in an interview. \"We started talking, and within 30 minutes of the first conversation, I told him, 'How much money do you want?'\"Reina explained that before the launch of ChatGPT, voice AI hadn't garnered much attention because big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all had text-to-speech products, but they hadn't really taken off.\"With ElevenLabs no one was looking at voice AI, literally no one wanted to give [them] money. No VCs wanted to actually back ElevenLabs, back in the early days on the pre-seed round. So those are the type of industries that I really like, so that I can get in before everyone else,\" he said.Reina has made 74 angel investments over the past eight years, including Revolut, Volumetric, Elroy Air, and Speckle. He now works for Eleven Labs as a go-to-market manager.He said he always tries to identify industries that other investors are not paying attention to: \"I've done [invested in] mostly AI before it was sexy. I've done robotics before it was sexy as well.\"The No.1 trait to watch for in foundersReina specializes in investing in pre-seed companies — those with an idea, but often without a fully developed product. This means identifying key traits in founders that indicate a startup will succeed.\"If there is a product, fantastic, but if there is no product, absolutely fine for me … I love founders that are very technical. They're super sharp,  very smart, literally trying to build a global company from day one,\" Reina explained.He said he \"invests based on thesis,\" so if a founder is very technical, they'll have a deeper understanding of the product and the market they're selling to.Reina said he saw these traits in Staniszewksi, which convinced him to back ElevenLabs despite the voice AI market being very small at the time.\"No one wants to talk to AI voices if they sound robotic. That's fundamentally the biggest problem that there was right… so when I spoke with Mati, he talked about both elements, and he had not been in the market,\" Reina said.\"It was really interesting to see he was thinking about the problems of the entire ecosystem before even actually having any product or before even actually talking to any real potential customer.\"Staniszewski had a background in mathematics with a first-class honors degree from Imperial College London. His vision and technical expertise sold Reina, and ElevenLabs became one of the few startups that he decided to back \"literally within less than an hour.\"Now, Eleven Labs is planning a global expansion, including building new hubs in Paris, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico, as well as getting the company ready for IPO within the next five years, Staniszewski told CNBC in July.",

    "body": "New-car prices have never been higher.The average sale price reached $50,080 in September, marking the first time it has topped $50,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.The milestone came as shoppers rushed to buy electric vehicles before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30, with EVs selling for an average of $58,124, which helped push overall prices higher, according to KBB.While new-car prices typically rise in early fall, September's year-over-year increase was the largest since the spring of 2023, driven by EV purchases, higher luxury sales and, to a lesser extent, tariffs, KBB says.\"Now that [the EV] incentive is gone, it's possible that electric vehicle sales will drop off somewhat and the average transaction price may dip below $50,000 in the later part of the year,\" Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book, tells CNBC Make It. Either way, car prices have climbed steadily since February. And once expenses like insurance, maintenance and fuel are factored in, monthly costs can exceed $1,000.What a $50,000 car really costs per monthTo show what today's prices mean for buyers, consider a $50,080 vehicle financed over 60 months with 20% down and a 7.12% interest rate — the current national average for a five-year new-car loan, according to Bankrate.That works out to a monthly payment of about $796. But when you add in gas and insurance, the real monthly cost climbs higher. Americans spend an average of $177 a month on fuel, per an analysis by Empower, and the national average cost of auto insurance with liability, collision and comprehensive protection is $242, per Experian. That brings total monthly costs for a new-car owner to roughly $1,215 a month.There are also annual and ongoing costs to consider, including:Maintenance and repairs: about $900 a year on average across all vehicle types in the U.S., according to ConsumerAffairsRegistration fees: an average of roughly $75 a year for registration, although it varies considerably by state, according to InsurifyConsider used or leased cars to offset costsIt's worth remembering that new cars can lose about 20% of their value in the first year and as much as 60% after five years, according to Kelley Blue Book.For cost-conscious buyers, it may be worth exploring used and leased options, which generally come with lower monthly payments.\"We're seeing more and more people turn to leasing as a way to keep ownership costs down as everything gets more expensive,\" says Zander Cook, co-founder of lease-buyout platform Lease End.Leasing essentially means renting a new car for a set term instead of buying it outright. While monthly payments tend to be lower, leases come with mileage limits — usually 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year — and may include fees for excess wear or mileage. Leases also don't result in ownership once the term ends.\"Leasing doesn't work for everyone. If you're driving a ton of miles a year or live somewhere really rural, it's probably not the best fit,\" Cook says. \"But for most people, especially those living in cities or suburbs, driving 10,000 to 12,000 miles a year, leasing makes a lot of sense.\"Another option is to buy a used car. The tradeoff here is that it may lead to higher maintenance and repair costs as the vehicle ages and warranty coverage expires.However, cars that are around three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability, according to J.D. Power. By then, most models have absorbed the steepest depreciation but still fall within warranty coverage.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

The segment also provides services to commercial nuclear clients.Stock Market Value: $7.89 billion ($48.79 per share)Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: Starboard ValueAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power, which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.Behind the scenesFluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile. Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion. As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company. Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval. As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value. If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times. Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation. Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential. Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside. Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000. But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Hoka shoes are seen in a store in Krakow, Poland on February 1, 2023. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of footwear maker Deckers Brands plunged 15% Friday after the company trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka and Ugg — the two brands driving its growth — over concerns that tariffs are leading to a slide in demand.Hoka, an up-and-coming running shoe brand, is now expected to grow by a low-teens percentage in fiscal 2026 after growing 24% in the year-ago period, while Boots brand Ugg is expected to grow in the range of a low to mid single-digit percentage, after growing 13% in the year-ago period.In May, the company said Hoka and Ugg were expected to grow in the mid-teens and mid-single digits, respectively, in fiscal 2026 but it caveated that forecast by saying it was conceived prior to the introduction of President Donald Trump's tariffs. At the time, it quantified the expected impact to its costs but said it remained to be determined what kind of impact the new duties could have on demand.When reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, finance chief Steven Fasching said the impacts tariffs and higher prices are having on demand are now more clear.\"Part of the framework that we gave at the beginning of the year really said if tariffs did not have an impact on consumers, how we saw kind of certain growth, and we still believe that, right? But we do know and we are more currently seeing some impacts on the U.S. consumer,\" Fasching told analysts on the company's conference call. \"So as U.S. consumers are beginning to see some price increases. It is impacting their purchase behavior within the consumer discretionary space.\"He added the guidance isn't far off from what the company originally thought but acknowledged there is a \"little bit of a reduction\" in its forecast.The slower pace of growth for Deckers' two top-performing lines, along with the trim to their sales guidance, signals the two brands could be losing momentum after years of outperformance. Together, Hoka and Ugg account for the vast majority of Deckers' revenue and have been critical in offsetting weaknesses in other categories.CEO Dave Powers, however, downplayed fears of a long-term slowdown, telling investors that both brands remain strong among core consumers.\"We're confident in the long-term trajectory of our portfolio,\" Powers said. \"While tariffs and inflation are creating near-term pressure, Hoka and Ugg continue to lead in brand heat and market share gains across their categories.\"Beyond Hoka and Ugg, Deckers' full-year revenue guidance came in lower than analysts' expectations. In fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $5.35 billion, shy of Wall Street's $5.45 billion forecast, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $6.30 and $6.39, roughly in line with the $6.32 per share estimate, according to LSEG.In the company's call with analysts, Fasching warned that tariff costs could total about $150 million this fiscal year. Executives said they expect to offset roughly half of those costs through price adjustments and cost-sharing with factory partners.Deckers' shares have dropped more than 55% year to date, leaving investors on edge about any signs of decelerating demand.",

    "body": "The headquaters of US auto company General Motos (GM) in Detroit, Michigan.Uli Deck | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesDETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.\"We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,\" GM said in an emailed statement. \"As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.\"GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to \"business conditions\" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are \"UP BIG on Tariffs\" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as \"Big and Midsized Trucks.\"While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.",

    "body": "A shopper at a grocery store in Dayton, Ohio, Oct. 21, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its much-anticipated consumer price index report, delayed a week and a half because of the government shutdown.Here are the five most important takeaways:While inflation is still running well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% goal, it's showing no signs of runaway and in fact is easing, at least a bit, in some key areas. The headline gain of 0.3% monthly and 3% annually both were slightly below consensus forecasts. Same for core CPI excluding food and energy, which ran at 0.2% monthly and 3% annually.Markets continued to price in a near certainty for a Fed rate cut next week, and upped the odds for another in December, with just a 4% probability the central bank won't ease two more times before the end of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Aside from the headline numbers, the biggest watch point for markets was tariff and immigration impacts, which showed up — a little. Apparel prices rose 0.7% and sporting goods costs jumped 1%. But smartphone prices declined 2.2% and are down 14.9% year over year. Gardening and lawn care services, an immigration-related category, posted a 13.9% annual increase.Shelter costs are another key category, as they make up one-third of the weighting in the index. There was some relief on that front, with the index up just 0.2% monthly and holding at 3.6% annually. Owners equivalent rent, a critical component of shelter costs that asks homeowners what they could fetch in rent, rose just 0.1%, the smallest such move for the measure since November 2020.With government data collection and reports under suspension because of the shutdown, the BLS compiled this report only because of its role as a benchmark for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. This, then, likely will be the last official data report released until the impasse is resolved.What they're saying:\"In aggregate today's inflation readings are encouraging, albeit still above the Federal Reserve's stated 2% inflation target. Yet, we think the overall inflation trend can continue to moderate over the next year ... as inflation breakevens have recently suggested, allowing the Fed to maintain its bias toward rate cuts.\"— Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a finalist to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year\"Look beneath the headline and what one sees on a year ago basis are large increases in the cost of food, meat, housing, and utilities. Middle class & down-market households experiencing a slowing pace of wage growth are clearly having difficulty adjusting to persisting increases in the cost of living ... It's only natural that those that inhibit the lower spur of the K ask: what is it that those celebrating a more modest increase in the pace of price increases see that indicates inflation is not eroding my bottom line & standard of living?\"— Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSK, on the K-shaped economy\"Signs of spillovers from tariffs remain weak and support the view that tariff hikes will translate into a one-off bump in prices instead of persistent inflationary pressures.\" — Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISM",

    "body": "Coke beverages are displayed in a 7-eleven convenient store on July 17, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAmid recession fears, a government shutdown and tariff uncertainty, consumers are increasingly diverging in their spending.Wealthier Americans are engaging their purchasing power, while lower-income Americans are starting to pull back — commonly described as a \"K-shaped\" economy. Friday's consumer price index report shed more light on the pressures facing large swaths of the country.The CPI report, which measures price changes across a range of goods and services, was delayed due to the government shutdown, originally scheduled to be released nine days prior. The report came in cooler-than-expected, showing a 0.3% increase on the month. That put the annual inflation rate at 3% and signals a likely rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.A subset of the CPI report also helps determine the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment, which the agency said Friday will be 2.8% in 2026.Lower- and middle-income consumers have been hit hardest by rising costs on daily essentials like groceries and gas. Meanwhile, wealthier investors have benefited from stock market rallies and rising home values. Recent data from JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey found that income bracket was a large factor in Americans' varying views of the current state of the economy.Here's where bifurcation is beginning to take hold:Food and beverageCoca-Cola, often viewed as a bellwether for the financial health of consumer, has been seeing the divergence across its business.Pricier products that are more exposed to high-income consumers, like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes, are fueling the company's sales growth, CEO James Quincey told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday. At the same time, Coke is seeing higher demand at both dollar stores that cater to low-income consumers looking for deals and higher-end outlets that skew toward wealthier consumers, like fast-casual restaurants and amusement parks.McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in early September that the burger chain's expansion of its value menu was in response to a divided consumer landscape, or what he called a \"two-tier economy.\"While Kempczinski said the company is seeing upper-income consumers performing well, its lower- and middle-income diners are \"a different story.\"\"Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits, and it's because people are either choosing to skip a meal... or they're choosing to just eat at home,\" he said last month.A similar dynamic is playing out at Chipotle, according to Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer.\"There are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now. That's something that we'll have to take into consideration when looking at price going forward,\" Rymer told Reuters in July.On Friday, Procter & Gamble said the company is seeing K-shaped shopping behaviors among its consumers, with wealthier shoppers buying bigger pack sizes from club retailers and lower-income shoppers exhausting their pantry inventory before returning to the stores.\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with reporters.Autos and airfareLast month, the average price for a new vehicle surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book.The record pricing comes as auto loan defaults and repossessions are on the rise, particularly for those with FICO scores below 620.\"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,\" said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating in a statement last week.And though airlines have been piloting premium offerings for years, the higher-cost tickets have gained momentum in recent months.Delta Air Lines said earlier this month that revenue from its premium offerings is expected to surpass the coach cabin next year, with CEO Ed Bastian saying he's not seeing any signs of slowdown in the roomier, more expensive seats.HospitalityStill, though there are signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy, some argue it's not here to stay.Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told CNBC last month that he's seeing a bifurcation, but he doesn't expect that pattern to last much longer, partly because he sees inflation and interest rates decreasing.\"My own belief is that as we look into the fourth quarter and particularly into next year, we're going to see a very big shift in those dynamics, meaning, I don't think you're going to continue to have this bifurcation,\" Nassetta said. \"That's not to say I think the high end is going to get worse or bad, I just think the middle and the low end is going to move up.\"On Wednesday, the hotel chain reported a drop in revenue for affordable brands like Hampton by Hilton and Homewood Suites by Hilton.Meanwhile, Nassetta told investors on an earnings call that revenue from luxury offerings performed exceedingly well and remains a focus for Hilton moving forward.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas, Michael Wayland, Alex Harring, Luke Fountain and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A Target logo is displayed outside one of their stores on August 2, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesTarget said on Thursday it's cutting 1,800 corporate jobs as the retailer tries to get back to growth after four years of roughly stagnant sales.It marks the first major round of layoffs in a decade for the Minneapolis-based retailer. It announced the layoffs in a memo sent by Target's incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to employees at its headquarters.The eliminated roles are a combination of about 1,000 employee layoffs and about 800 positions that will no longer be filled, a company spokesman said. Together, they represent an approximately 8% cut to Target's corporate workforce, according to the memo. Affected employees will be notified Tuesday.The retailer announced the cuts as it nears a leadership change.Target in August named Fiddelke, currently its chief operating officer and formerly chief financial officer, as the successor to longtime leader Brian Cornell. He takes the helm February 1.Fiddelke has also overseen the Enterprise Acceleration Office, an effort announced in May, which looked for ways to simplify company operations, use technology in new ways and speed up Target's growth. Target has been fighting a sales slump, as it tries to rebound from declining store traffic, inventory troubles and customer backlash. The company has said it expects annual sales to decline this year. Its shares have fallen by 65% since their all-time high in late 2021.Compared to retail competitors, Target draws less of its overall sales from groceries and other necessities, which can make its business more vulnerable to the ups and downs of the economy and consumer sentiment. About half of Target's sales come from discretionary items, compared to only 40% at Walmart, according to estimates from GlobalData Retail.As a result of that and other company-specific challenges, Target's sales trends and stock performance have diverged sharply from competitors. Shares of Walmart are up about 123% in the past five years, compared to Target's decline of 41% during the same time period.In a memo sent Thursday to employees at Target's headquarters, Fiddelke said the employee cuts will help Target make urgent changes.\"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" he said in the memo. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\"He said the cuts are difficult, but \"a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.\"   Target employees affected by the layoffs will receive pay and benefits until January 3, in addition to severance packages, according to a company spokesman. No roles in stores or in Target's supply chain were impacted by the cuts, the company spokesman said.Read the full memo from Fiddelke:Team, This spring, we launched our enterprise acceleration efforts with a clear ambition: to move faster and simplify how we work to drive Target's next chapter of growth. The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life. On Tuesday, we'll share changes to our headquarters structure as an important step in accelerating how we work. This includes eliminating about 1,800 non-field roles — about 8% of our global HQ team. As we make these changes, I'm asking all U.S. HQ team members to work from home next week. Target in India and our other global teams will follow their in-office routines. Decisions that affect our team are the most significant ones we make, and we never make them lightly. I know the real impact this has on our team, and it will be difficult. And, it's a necessary step in building the future of Target and enabling the progress and growth we all want to see.   Adjusting our structure is one part of the work ahead of us. It will also require new behaviors and sharper priorities that strengthen our retail leadership in style and design and enable faster execution so we can: Lead with merchandising authority; Elevate the guest experience with every interaction; and Accelerate technology to enable our team and delight our guests. Put together, these changes set the course for our company to be stronger, faster and better positioned to serve guests and communities for many years to come. Michael ",

    "body": "watch nowPrices that people pay for a variety of goods and services rose less than expected in September, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday that keeps the door wide open for another interest rate cut next week.The consumer price index showed a 0.3% increase on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for readings of 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The annual rate reflected a 0.1 percentage point uptick from August.Excluding food and energy, core CPI showed a 0.2% monthly gain and an annual rate also at 3%, compared with estimates of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Core CPI on a monthly basis had posted 0.3% gains in both July and August.The CPI reading is the only official economic data allowed to be released during the government shutdown.\"Like an oasis slaking the thirst of a weary desert traveler, today's CPI number offered investors the first tidbit of information from the barren wasteland of government data that has existed since the shutdown started Oct 1,\" wrote John Kerschner, global head of securitized products at Janus Henderson. \"Investors were not disappointed. Inflation came in softer than expected, leading to a tepid bond market rally, and ensuring that the Fed will cut rates at next week's Open Market Committee meeting.\"A 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was the largest contributor to a report that otherwise showed inflation pressures fairly muted. Food prices saw a 0.2% increase. Commodity prices overall rose 0.5%. On an annual basis, energy was up 2.8% and food rose 3.1%.Within the food index, prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year, while nonalcoholic beverages increased 5.3%. In energy, while prices pushed higher for electricity, up 5.1%, and natural gas, up 11.7%, over the past year, gasoline prices actually fell 0.5% during the period.Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, rose just 0.2% and were up 3.6% from a year ago. Services excluding shelter costs also were 0.2% higher.New vehicles saw a 0.8% increase, but used car and truck prices fell 0.4%.Stock market futures added to gains following the release, while Treasury yields were slightly negative.\"Inflation might not be slowing but it's not surprising to the upside anymore,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.The report provides a glimpse into the state of the U.S. economy at a time when all other data releases have been suspended. There were only limited impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs, though they likely have not made their way fully through the economy yet.watch nowCore goods prices saw just a 0.2% gain on the month. Data within the CPI report, combined with the Customs revenue generated by tariffs, indicate a \"realized\" tariff rate of just 10%, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.There are signs of \"a strong substitution effect already coming through – US companies switching to lower tariff countries for their product sourcing with the composition of imports shifting,\" Knightly wrote.\"The result is companies are better able to absorb these more modest than feared cost increases and there has been less impact on inflation than predicted so far,\" he said. \"In time we expect the realized tariff rate to rise and goods prices to be more heavily impacted, but we continue to argue that tariffs will be a one-off step change in prices rather than something that will lead to more persistent inflation.\"Final report before the FedThe BLS released the data specifically because the Social Security Administration uses it as a benchmark for cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, in benefit checks. Otherwise, the federal government has suspended all data compilation and releases until the fiscal impasse in Washington is settled. The CPI report was originally scheduled for release Oct. 15.In addition to providing a COLA guide, the CPI release is the final significant data point the Federal Reserve will get before it makes its interest rate decision next week. The Fed has a 2% inflation goal. The headline measure was last below that level in February 2021.A shopper looks at a sales advertisement at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"This report will clearly keep the Fed on track to cut rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"The Fed has been clear that they are more focused on the softening labor data and will continue to defend their full employment mandate, even with core CPI well above their 2% target.\"Markets are pricing in a near-certainty that the central bank lowers its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point from its current target range of 4%-4.25%. Traders also are anticipating another cut in December.However, the path after that is much less clear.Worries persist that Trump's tariffs could cause another round of painful inflation. At the same time, Fed policymakers worry that a slump in hiring this year could spread, though layoffs remain low.Tariff-sensitive apparel prices saw a 0.7% increase in September, while durable goods moved 0.3% higher.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have expressed generally cautious tones about the pace of rate cuts as they weigh the threat of inflation against weakness in the labor market. For his part, Trump has insisted that inflation is no longer a problem and the Fed should be cutting aggressively.",

    "body": "watch nowThere's just two months until Christmas Eve, and retailers are meeting a more cautious shopper with earlier offerings.Most retailers won't report third-quarter results or updated holiday expectations until just before Thanksgiving, largely considered the sector's most important week of the year. By then, many shoppers will have already started checking off holiday shopping lists.Amazon's October Prime Day sales event and competitors' ever-earlier Black Friday deals grab some portion of the holiday wallet share. The unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season comes as executives point to a bifurcation in consumer spending, with lower-income consumers feeling the strain on their budgets, and as a government shutdown and tariff costs threaten purchasing power.Kohl's is among the retailers chasing holiday shopping early with hopes of boosting the total haul.\"We want to make sure we're driving that early consideration knowing that they're shopping early,\" Kohl's Chief Marketing Officer Christie Raymond said at a media event earlier this month.The off-mall department store is starting its holiday marketing campaign next week, a week earlier than last year, when it waited until after the election. In the coming days it will be breaking out the rest of the holiday merchandise not already set out in stores.A key part of Kohl's holiday strategy is to capture shoppers not only early, but often.Raymond said during the last holiday season, between November and January, shoppers made \"15 plus trips\" on average to stores across the industry, but checked out with smaller baskets. Those findings were based on a survey that Kohl's conducted with a third-party research firm.\"[Consumers are] doing the work to get what they want at the price they want to pay,\" she said.While Academy Sports and Outdoors CEO Steve Lawrence agreed that shoppers are savvy when it comes to price monitoring, he said he expects customers \"to aggregate their spending around those key shopping moments on the calendar where they know they can get the best deals.\"Both Kohl's and Academy Sports cater largely to a middle-income shopper. Still, Lawrence said consumers are paying close attention to discount events.\"If we run the same promotion this year that we ran last year, there's higher take rate on it,\" he said. \"I think that's a sign customers are really savvy, and they're figuring out when it's the right time to shop.\"Shifting shopping habitsLawrence said that while promotions are part of every holiday season's playbook, Academy Sports will be tweaking how it runs discounts this year in light of higher engagement with the deals.\"If last year we ran a promotion for 10 days, maybe I only run it for 4 days over the Thanksgiving weekend,\" he said. \"Maybe instead of having a whole brand promoted, maybe it's only the key categories within that brand, right? Or maybe in some cases, it might be promoting at a slightly lower discount.\"Raymond said Kohl's is seeing shoppers reaching for lower-price options and expects that to continue during the holiday season.\"Customers maybe were purchasing a premium brand, but we are seeing them trading down to private brands,\" she said. \"We think we're in actually a great position to capitalize on that.\"A private brand is one made for and sold by only one retailer, allowing for more control over design and, importantly, cost. That can mean lower prices for shoppers and higher margins for the retailer than a national brand.Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile Kohl's doesn't disclose the proportion of its sales that are private label, Chief Merchandising Officer Nick Jones said it's not as high as it used to be, adding there's opportunity to boost that share this holiday season, particularly for shoppers trying to stretch their wallets.About 23% of Academy Sports business is private label, the company has said.\"In a lot of cases, [our private label] is our best expression of value,\" Lawrence said. \"Our goal is to be at or better than the best price on a given day.\"However, Lawrence said, innovation has to continue to inspire sales.'Cautiously optimistic'The retail industry has repeatedly described its customer in recent quarters as \"choiceful,\" to indicate thoughtful spending, but also \"resilient.\" Executives continue to use those descriptors, or synonyms for them, for the upcoming holiday season.\"I think certainly with inflation in certain categories, it's put some pressure on spending power,\" Lawrence said. \"But you know, what we've also seen is customers are very resilient. They do come out during the key shopping time periods. They came out for Mother's Day, Father's Day, back-to-school. We expect they're going to come out again for holiday.\"Dick's Sporting Goods Executive Chairman Ed Stack told CNBC this week he thought the consumer was \"a little bit stressed\" this season, but that he's \"cautiously optimistic.\"\"If you're going to provide value to the consumer, and they can see that, feel that value — and I'm not talking about from a price standpoint, could be innovation ... then they are going to come and they are going to buy,\" Stack said.Executives for all three retailers agree inventory positions for holiday will be normal, despite tariff uncertainty that many feared would affect order volumes. None of the three were expecting merchandise shortages.\"I don't think [inventory availability] is going to be any different than it has been in the past,\" Stack said. \"That really super hot item that everybody wants? That's probably going to be in short supply, like it is every year.\"",

TheStewartofNY | GC Images | Getty ImagesCompany: Six Flags Entertainment (FUN)Business: Six Flags Entertainment is a regional amusement-resort operator with approximately 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resort properties across 17 states in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The company provides memorable experiences to millions of guests every year with coasters, themed rides, thrilling water parks, resorts and a portfolio of intellectual property such as Looney Tunes, DC Comics and Peanuts. The company's parks include Hurricane Harbor Phoenix, California's Great America, Knott's Berry Farm, Knott's Soak City Waterpark, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags White Water, Cedar Point Shores Waterpark, Six Flags Great America, Six Flags Fiesta Texas, Hurricane Harbor Splashtown, Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom and others.Stock Market Value: $2.60 billion ($25.63 per share) Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSix Flags Entertainment stock year to dateActivist: Jana PartnersOwnership: ~9%Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long-term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were: (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\" (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Jana announced that it had partnered with Travis Kelce, Glenn Murphy and Dave Habiger in an investment in Six Flags Entertainment and plans to engage with the company's board and management regarding opportunities to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.Behind the scenesSix Flags Entertainment is a regional amusement-resort operator with approximately 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks and nine resort properties across 17 states in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In November 2023, Six Flags announced that it would be merging with Cedar Fair. While this news received backlash from some investors, most notably from activist Land & Buildings, the merger was completed in July 2024. At the time, this merger seemed like an opportunity to combine Six Flags' regional dominance in amusement parks, strong licensing arrangements (such as its lifetime IP agreement with Warner Brothers) and modern tech and pricing backbone with Cedar Fair's operational discipline, best-in-class park experience and high customer satisfaction rate to generate synergies and elevate Six Flags' asset value.However, this arrangement has not really gone as planned. In the second quarter, Six Flags faced severe weather conditions during their typical peak May to June season, which resulted in substantial EBITDA and attendance misses. Moreover, the company entered this period highly levered from the merger, and these misses only amplified the company's balance sheet problems in the eyes of investors. This sent Six Flags' share price down over 58% from the completion of the Cedar Fair merger to the day prior to Jana's announcement.Stock action like this on otherwise strong businesses that is due to an idiosyncratic event like weather that is not likely to recur generally gets the attention of good value investors. However, Six Flags does have other issues, namely poor operational execution, integrating the Cedar Fair merger and identifying a new CEO, as CEO Richard Zimmerman has announced he is stepping down from his role at the end of 2025.Jana Partners is now the fifth activist investor in this stock. Other include Sachem Head (4.82%), H Partners (4.59%), Dendur (4.38%) and Land & Buildings (n/a). All of those other activists, except L&B, have received board representation.Jana, as it often does, is coming in with an All-Star team: Glenn Murphy, executive chairman of Petco and former chairman and CEO of the Gap; Dave Habiger, chairman of Reddit; and NFL Superstar Travis Kelce. The investment group holds a roughly 9% economic interest and plans to engage Six Flags' board and management team to explore ways to enhance shareholder value and improve the guest experience.Much of Jana's campaign echoes the qualms already raised by the other activists in the stock, including the company's potential to unlock value by reinvigorating the business as a standalone company with a new CEO and/or monetizing the real estate, or even selling the entire company. Regardless of which plan is pursued, the company must immediately start down the road of fixing its operational issues.Operationally, Six Flags has forfeited a substantial opportunity by failing to integrate its consumer-facing technology. More than a year post-merger, Six Flags still operates over 10 different apps, and even basic transactions like purchasing a season pass on the website have been unreliable, so modernizing and streamlining this technology could go a long way.The company also needs to reexamine its operating strategy during inclement weather and adopt a more disciplined capex framework. For example, despite this poor weather during the second quarter, Six Flags still kept its parks open on more days during this quarter than the same period last year, resulting in significant and unnecessary losses.Jana also believes Six Flags has the opportunity to leverage its existing real estate to implement year-round and inclement weatherproof experiences, such as indoor skydiving and trampoline parks.Kelce cool factorNext, the company needs to reinvigorate its advertising and marketing. Six Flags is one of the most recognizable entertainment brands, but its advertising has been stale, abandoning regional marketing efforts while also missing the opportunity to leverage its national scale. While the new CEO will likely have good ideas in this area, having access to Travis Kelce, one of the most popular and liked celebrities in the world across all demographics is a valuable potential marketing asset. (For example, look what Sydney Sweeney has already done for American Eagle with just one ad.)Kelce has not signed on as a brand ambassador or in any capacity other than as a shareholder, but he is a true fan of amusement parks like Six Flags, has already added advertising value to the company just by talking about it on his podcast and there is always a potential to do more with him either informally or through some sort of an agreement. Brand revitalization catalyzed by Kelce's active involvement provides a meaningful opportunity to lift attendance and engagement at Six Flags.JANA's partnership with Mr. Kelce is unprecedented in two respects: 1) it pairs an activist and a world-famous celebrity that has personally invested in the company and is using their star power to boost the company's brand from the outside in a highly authentic manner, and 2) it brings a perfectly tailored solution to rejuvenate the company's branding and marketing, reaffirming its cool factor and resolving any concern about Six Flag's brand relevance that has weighed on the company's multiple.Finally, and probably most importantly, the ongoing CEO process presents a golden opportunity to recruit a world class operator capable of executing upon these initiatives. In the world of shareholder activism, there are not many better opportunities for value creation than the activist having a say in identifying a new CEO for a great but struggling business.With multiple activists participating in this process, we would expect the new CEO to be a first-rate operator with strong views on creating value for shareholders. Moreover, a reconstituted board over the past several years and the addition of Kelce as a potential formal or informal brand ambassador may increase the quality of the candidate pool.That all being said, a CEO vacancy is also often the perfect time to explore strategic alternatives, and Jana is still urging the company to evaluate a potential sale of underperforming parks and/or the entire company.Should Six Flags position itself for a sale, there would likely be both private equity and strategic interest. Apollo, for example, attempted to acquire Cedar Fair back in 2010 before their merger fell through due to lack of investor support, and Blackstone already owns Great Wolf Lodge – a complementary asset.In terms of strategics, the growing media and entertainment trend of integrating physical park assets into cross-platform media ecosystems makes the industry a logical candidate. Media titans like Disney and Comcast have already provided the blueprint on how to leverage amusement parks to promote intellectual property.Paramount, the third peer to Disney and Comcast, is the only one without an amusement park after interestingly selling five Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair in 2006. This becomes even more intriguing now that Paramount has made a $57 billion bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery. Six Flags has a licensing agreement with Warner Brothers and at a current $2.6 billion market cap, would be a logical add-on to its acquisition by Paramount, or any strategic investor for that matter. (Netflix has also shown interest).Jana is a highly experienced activist with a track record for showing up with operators tailor-made for a company's specific problems, and that's exactly what they have done here. The perfect brand ambassador and two corporate legends with almost unparalleled consumer and technology-based operational turnaround expertise may be exactly the medicine required here. With that in mind, we would normally argue that this is too crowded of a shareholder base for Jana to gain board representation, as there are already six directors on the board who were appointed pursuant to an activist settlement. However, we believe that the activists with representatives already on the board are like-minded to Jana and would welcome directors of this quality to help pursue a path they all seem to agree on.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said on Thursday that the servers will power the company's Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services. Apple is using its own silicon in its Apple Intelligence servers.\"Our teams have done an incredible job accelerating work to get the new Houston factory up and running ahead of schedule and we plan to continue expanding the facility to increase production next year,\" Khan said in a statement.The Houston factory is on track to create thousands of jobs, Apple said.

    "body": "watch nowProcter & Gamble on Friday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, lifted by higher demand for its beauty and grooming products.Despite higher costs from tariffs and what CEO Jon Moeller called a \"challenging consumer and geopolitical environment,\" P&G reiterated its forecast for all-in sales and earnings for the fiscal year, which began in July.Here's what the company reported for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.99 adjusted vs. $1.90 expectedRevenue: $22.39 billion vs. $22.18 billion expectedP&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.75 billion, or $1.95 per share, up from $3.96 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain items, including costs associated with incremental restructuring, the consumer giant earned $1.99 per share.Net sales rose 3% to $22.39 billion. Organic sales — which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency — increased 2% in the quarter.Though revenue metrics were higher, P&G's volume was flat compared with the year-ago period. Volume excludes pricing, which makes it a more accurate reflection of demand than sales. Like many consumer companies, P&G has seen demand for some of its products fall as inflation-weary consumers seek out deals.'K-shaped' shopping\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with media, adding that shoppers have behaved similarly in the last few quarters.In the United States, the company's largest market, consumption across P&G's broad swath of products has slowed \"a little bit,\" according to Schulten. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is seeing a bifurcation in how consumers are shopping based on their incomes, often described as a \"K-shaped\" economy.Shoppers who are less cash constrained are buying bigger pack sizes from club and online retailers, Schulten said.\"That's their way to look for value,\" he said.But U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck are looking to stretch their money further by using every bottle of detergent or shampoo to the last drop and exhausting their pantry inventory before shopping for more, according to Schulten.At the same time, private label brands are losing market share, bucking previous shopping trends during economic downturns, executives said on the company's conference call. After the recession in 2008, P&G shifted its strategy to create more premium products that couldn't be easily substituted with cheaper private label versions.Boxes of Tide Pods dishwasher detergent are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on July 12, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesP&G reported Friday that volume for both its health care and fabric and home care divisions, which include Tide and Swiffer, fell 2% during the quarter.The company is seeing \"heightened competition\" in those categories, fueled by promotions and discounting from rivals, executives said on the conference call. To win back customers, P&G is focusing on innovation that can justify higher prices and convince shoppers that its products are superior. For example, Schulten said that Tide is starting shipments of its \"biggest upgrade to liquid detergent in 20 years.\"The company's baby, feminine and family care segment reported flat volume for the quarter. That division includes brands like Pampers and Tampax.P&G's beauty business was a bright spot. The division, which includes Olay and SK-II, reported volume growth of 4% and overall sales growth of 6%. Olay's Super Serum line was the brand's top performer, showing that customers were willing to pay more for premium skincare.And P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette and Venus razors, saw volume rise 1% in the quarter for a sales increase of 5%.For fiscal 2026, the company is now projecting that President Donald Trump's tariffs will result in $400 million in after-tax costs, down from its prior outlook of $800 million. When P&G originally formulated its forecast, it included retaliatory tariffs on Canada, which have since been rescinded. As a result, the company is now planning a smaller raise in prices than it expected, Moeller said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.However, Trump said on Thursday evening that he is terminating all trade talks with Canada over a TV ad, which could mean higher costs ahead for P&G.P&G also reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast of sales growth between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09.",

    "body": "watch nowIRVINE, Calif. — Taco Bell is going all in on beverages, starting with its Live Más Café concept.The Yum Brands chain unveiled the drink-focused store format last December, with the first location in Chula Vista, California. Ten months later came the second location, near the University of California, Irvine campus. By the end of the year, Taco Bell is projecting that it will have 30 Live Más Cafés in its portfolio, across Southern California, Dallas and Houston.Unlike McDonald's now-defunct CosMc's spinoff, which had its own standalone locations, the Live Más Café lives inside existing Taco Bell restaurants. Customers order at kiosks and can watch the \"bellristas\" assemble their drinks from behind the designated counter, which takes prime real estate in the store. The drink menu includes a range of beverage options, from blended coffees to lemonade-based drinks.The beverage-focused concept is supposed to help the Mexican-inspired chain reach its goal of generating a $5 billion drink business by 2030. Taco Bell first disclosed that target in March at an investor day, where the chain shared more about its plans to keep growing as it fuels Yum's operating profit growth.So far this year, Taco Bell has sold more than 600 million beverages, up 16% from the year-ago period, according to the company. More than 60% of the chain's orders this year have included a drink, Taco Bell said.\"I think drinks are big right now because I think people are really craving unique, interesting flavors in their beverages, and we hear that all the time from our consumers,\" said Liz Matthews, global chief food innovation officer for Taco Bell.Center stageTaco Bell's Live Más Café.Courtesy: Taco BellStepping inside the Irvine location, the Live Más Café beverage station is the clear star.Most of the self-order kiosks are positioned in front of the station's long counter. Customers have a free view of the \"bellristas\" making their specialty drinks, unlike the restaurant's other employees who assemble Crunchwrap Supremes and Chalupas hidden from sight.Digital menu boards across the restaurant highlight the beverage offerings. The drink menu spans four distinct categories: churro chillers, specialty coffees, refrescas and \"bellrista favorites.\"The churro chillers are creamy and cold milkshakes topped with churro chunks. The specialty coffees come either hot, iced or blended as a \"chiller.\" Brightly colored refrescas use either lemonade, green tea or Rockstar energy drinks as the base for their fruity flavors, such as strawberry passionfruit or mango peach. And the \"bellrista favorites\" include seasonal options, such as the autumnal caramel apple empanada churro chiller, which incorporates blended chunks of Taco Bell's apple empanada.When crafting the menu, Matthews and her team tried to stick to the chain's Mexican-inspired roots, but she said Taco Bell will always have a \"playful spirit.\"And while the Live Más Café offers plenty of options with a variety of flavors, Taco Bell kept the options to customize minimal.\"What we found when we talked to consumers, they actually really want us to curate their drink for them,\" Matthews said.To date, the Irvine location's top-selling drinks are the Mexican Chocolate Churro Chiller, the Dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast Dream Soda and the Mango Peach Agua Refresca. Six of the top 10 bestselling drinks at the location are chillers. That's a reversal from the initial test location in Chula Vista, which has seen similar demand for every drink category, according to Matthews.Since its opening day in September, the Irvine location has been selling more than 900 drinks per day, according to Taco Bell. More than a third of orders include an item from the Live Más Café menu.Meanwhile, the Chula Vista location — which exceeded its initial sales forecast by four times — is selling more than 750 beverages a day nearly a year since its opening, the company said. A quarter of all transactions include a Live Más Café beverage, according to Taco Bell.\"Given what we're seeing right now from the business results, the payback looks really attractive and in line with what our franchisees would expect for something big, but we've got a lot more to learn,\" said Taylor Montgomery, global chief brand officer of Taco Bell.'Little treat'This year, the hottest trend in fast food hasn't been a chicken sandwich or plant-based burgers. Instead, beverages of all consistencies, colors and nutritional values have taken the spotlight.For example, Shake Shack is selling lemonade with mini raspberry popping boba, inspired by the success of bubble tea. Panera Bread is testing frescas and energy refreshers in select bakery-cafés. Chick-fil-A is planning to open Daybright — a beverage-focused restaurant with specialty coffees, smoothies and cold-pressed juices — in Hiram, Georgia, later this year. And although McDonald's this summer wound down its spin-off called CosMc's that focused on drinks and snacks, it also tested new coffee drinks, refreshers and flavored sodas at more than 500 U.S. restaurants.The number of beverages sold by the top 500 chains has climbed more than 9% in the last year, according to Technomic. The swell of beverage innovation follows the speedy expansion of a number of a specialty drink chains, from upstart 7 Brew Coffee to dirty-soda inventor Swig.\"[Quick-service chains] have seen that there's a big opportunity with an entire generation and how they're interested in that 'little treat' culture,\" said Claire Conaghan, \"trendologist\" at Datassential, which tracks menu trends. \"There's options to kind of go beyond their focus area of core meal and really lean into that snacking moment.\"Generation Z and millennials are driving the trend, according to Varchasvi Singh, a foodservice analyst for Mintel. Younger generations enjoy customizing their food and beverage orders.\"Among younger consumers, in particular, we see that fast-food dining is just as much about experimentation and novelty as it is about indulgence,\" Singh said. \"They're a lot more open to trying premium menu items and personalizing their orders, whereas older generations, who have associated fast food with extreme affordability for a long time, are a little bit more critical of how expensive it has become for them.\"For Taco Bell, turning to beverages and creating the Live Más Café is part of its broader plan to appeal to younger consumers, whose spending power is projected to increase rapidly in just a few years.\"Over the past five years, we've really, really been transitioning and thinking about the brand and how to position it for Gen Z, and so Café was really born from that,\" Montgomery said. \"I think it's something like 60% of Gen Z consumers come to a restaurant or [quick-service restaurant] for an afternoon treat.\"Rather than creating a standalone Live Más Café, Taco Bell chose to put the sub-brand inside existing restaurants in part because of \"humility,\" according to Montgomery.\"Today, we're not known to be a beverage destination — yet,\" he told CNBC.Live Más Café can also help Taco Bell more broadly.\"It also acts a little bit as a test market where they can get some more real-time data. Which combos do people do the most?\" Conaghan said. \"Which customizations matter the most? Do we need every type of alternative milk or maybe just these one or two? Do we need all 15 flavors of whatever energy refresher?\"That's already started happening. Taco Bell's agua frescas, which began as a Live Más Café menu line, have since been launched nationwide.\"They're one of our top-selling items, and we didn't wait to scale the Café,\" Montgomery said. \"We pushed those in all the restaurants, and we've seen success there.\"Plus, the coffee options on the café's menu are part of Taco Bell's plan to make a bigger push into breakfast. The chain started serving the morning meal more than a decade ago but told franchisees last year that they could opt out serving breakfast; for some fast-food operators, opening early isn't profitable, plus there's the added headache of finding staff willing to work the morning shift.Taco Bell has already had some success with another sub-brand. Its Cantina format, typically found in cities, features a custom menu, alcoholic beverages and seating meant to encourage customers to linger. Since opening the first location in Chicago a decade ago, Taco Bell Cantina has grown to dozens of restaurants.Broadly, even as inflation-weary consumers pull back their spending, Taco Bell's focus on new menu items has lifted its sales; earlier this year, the company announced plans to double innovation in 2025. Taco Bell's prices have climbed 75.5% since 2019, according to Technomic's Ignite Menu. Still, customers keep coming back.In recent years, Taco Bell has been the gem of Yum's portfolio, typically outperforming both Wall Street's expectations and its sister chains, KFC and Pizza Hut. Executives have named the chain as one of the company's primary growth engines. In the second quarter, while many fast-food rivals reported shrinking sales, Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 4%.\"From a portfolio standpoint, we represent a pretty significant amount of Yum's operating profit, but we learn a lot from other brands, too,\" Montgomery said.Yum is expected to report its third-quarter earnings before the bell on Nov 4.Watch the video to learn more about why Taco Bell is betting on drinks.",

(AMD), during a fireside chat at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, India, on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2024. Gabriela Bhaskar | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Advanced Micro Devices jumped nearly 8% on Friday following a report that IBM can utilize the company's chips to run a quantum computing error correction algorithm.IBM shares gained about 8% and headed for their best day since January.Reuters reported on Friday that a paper will publish next week showing that IBM can run a quantum error correction algorithm on AMD's field-programmable gate array chips. An IBM spokesman confirmed the report to CNBC.In August, the two companies announced an agreement to develop quantum computing capabilities and integrate technologies. IBM said it plans to debut a \"large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer\" by 2029.IBM called the new development a \"milestone in our clear path\" toward the 2029 projection.\"Designing and implementing a way to do this at scale, and without requiring expensive GPU clusters, is a significant achievement to scaling useful quantum computers,\" the company said in a statement.AMD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The technology utilizes quantum mechanics to address problems that traditional computers are unable to solve. Technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also racing to develop quantum computing.Last year, Microsoft rolled out its first quantum computing chip, while Google launched its breakthrough chip named WIllow. A top quantum executive at Google told CNBC in March that the technology was \"five years out from a real breakout.\"The various announcements have brought renewed interest to the quantum space, boosting stocks like D-Wave Quantum, Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which all climbed on Friday.The Trump administration on Thursday refuted a report that it was negotiating stakes in quantum companies.Correction: This story has been updated after Reuters corrected its report about what IBM will be able to do with AMD's chips.WATCH: Commerce Department denies it is currently in talks for stakes in quantum companieswatch now",

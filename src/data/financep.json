    "body": "The Novo Nordisk A/S headquarters in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. Nichlas Pollier | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk on Monday fell to a four-year low after the Danish drug pharmaceutical company said a highly-anticipated trial for Alzheimer's disease failed to meet its main goal.The trial tested whether semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy — helped slow progression for Alzheimer's disease. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers in two separate trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression, Novo said in a statement Monday. The goal had been to slow patient's cognitive decline by at least 20%.Novo stock was down 8.3% to 279 Danish kroner as of 12:15 a.m. GMT (7:15 a.m. ET), it's lowest level since July 2021. Shares of Eli Lilly also fell about 1% while Biogen stock rose 5% in premarket trade.Analysts had prior to the results called the trials a long shot, whereas Novo itself had referred it as a \"lottery ticket.\"\"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success,\" said Novo's Chief Scientific Officer Martin Holst Lange.Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is notoriously difficult to treat. It is also expected to affect an increasing proportion of people worldwide as populations grow older. Current treatments such as Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to a third, but come with the risk of severe side-effects.This is breaking news.

    "body": "It's natural to want to comfort a child when they're crying. When parents see their kid hurting physically or emotionally, they often want to do anything in their power to stop their heartache. As a dual certified child life specialist and therapist, I've heard parents and even health care workers telling kids \"don't cry\" while wiping away their tears during medical procedures and other difficult moments. It comes from a place of wanting to fix the hurt and make it all better. But it can make kids feel like their emotions and tears aren't okay, especially when they're in pain or distress. Instead, try to validate kids' feelings and help them feel safe and supported expressing their emotions and tears. Use these five alternatives:1. 'It's okay to cry, I'm here with you.'This helps kids know and believe that their experience is real and it's natural. Staying with kids through their stress conveys the message that their feelings don't scare you, that you can handle the difficult moments with them, and that they can rely on you for real-time support, even when it's hard or uncomfortable. 2. 'I see your tears.'You may not always know exactly why a child is crying or understand their reaction to the situation. Validation doesn't necessarily mean agreement; it means, \"I see you and I believe you.\" One way to validate their experience is to simply reflect back what you're seeing. Naming their emotion can be helpful for some kids, but for others it can be upsetting if your label doesn't match what they're truly feeling. Try naming their behaviors or using a more encompassing term such as \"upset.\"3. 'Your feelings make sense.'If kids hear, \"don't cry,\" they might interpret that their response doesn't match the situation, when in fact, it often does. We want kids to trust their feelings and to know that their tears make sense for what they're experiencing, whether it's pain, fear, or isolation. Sometimes the behaviors will be out of proportion with the situation, but the underlying feelings are never wrong. 4. 'It's natural to feel sad.'Parents often want their kids to feel happy, but it's natural to feel a range of emotions including difficult or uncomfortable ones. The goal is not to stop the emotion but to help kids acknowledge and manage it. Helping kids understand that crying is not bad — and that it's perfectly natural to feel sad, angry, lonely, or frustrated sometimes — reduces a sense of shame from any negative experiences. 5. 'Crying is one healthy way our bodies let feelings out.'Lastly, it's important for kids to understand that crying is a very healthy way to release emotions. Crying is coping and so is coloring, playing, talking, running, listening to music, and breathing. You can help kids try different strategies and find the ones that work best for them. Use tears as a chance to meet kids where they're at and help them work through challenges with confidence and connection. Kelsey Mora is a Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Amina AlTai has always been a high achiever.As a child of immigrants, she was told to \"keep your head down, work really hard, and if you do that, you'll have everything you want,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Her early career looked \"great on paper,\" she says: AlTai opened her own marketing agency in her late 20s, and says she was \"achieving all the milestones\" of success.At the same time, she was overworking herself to the point of illness, she says. One day, while driving to a client meeting, she got a call from her physician. \"My doctor called to say that if I don't go to the hospital now, instead of going to work, I'll be days away from multiple organ failure\" due to severe anemia, AlTai says.In hindsight, the moment was \"such a wake-up call,\" she says — but instead of heading straight for the hospital, AlTai first attended her client meeting.She says she was subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, both of which were exacerbated by exhaustion.\"My workaholic tendencies and painful relationship to success were — quite literally — killing me,\" AlTai, now 41, wrote in her recent book, \"The Ambition Trap: How to Stop Chasing and Start Living.\"Today, AlTai is a leadership coach who teaches her clients how to protect their wellbeing and practice healthy ambition. \"So many of us are working ourselves into pain and suffering,\" she says — but it doesn't have to be that way. Here's her advice for building a healthy mindset around ambition.'Painful' versus 'purposeful' ambitionThough AlTai's unhealthy relationship with ambition caused her to \"crash and burn,\" she says, it doesn't mean that being driven is inherently a bad thing.\"I think ambition is neutral and natural,\" she says. She defines it as \"simply a desire for more life, a wish to grow, a wish to unfold.\"In AlTai's view, people tend to experience ambition in two ways, she says: \"painful\" ambition and \"purposeful\" ambition.Painful ambition, which AlTai defines as \"the voracious desire to advance, regardless of the cost,\" stems from a feeling of \"not-enoughness,\" she writes in \"The Ambition Trap.\" From a psychological perspective, painful ambition is based in emotional \"core wounds\" like rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice, she says.\"If you build your ambition upon that, it's going to be a bit of a house of cards,\" AlTai says, \"because we're perpetually looking for the salve on the outside for the wound on the inside, and that never works.\"On the other hand, purposeful ambition \"comes from a place of wholeness,\" she says. People who practice purposeful ambition are driven by a desire to make a positive impact, AlTai says. They excel at collaborating with others, protect their needs and approach their mistakes with a growth mindset.Self-awareness is the key to turning painful ambition into purposeful ambition, according to AlTai. She encourages her clients to journal about their thought patterns without self-judgement, taking note when they fall into unhealthy mindsets.Habits for healthy ambitionIn order to stay in the zone of healthy ambition, one essential practice is \"honoring your energy,\" AlTai says. That means making time for the things that nourish you, from nutrition and exercise to spending time with loved ones.Without taking care of ourselves, \"it's really hard to show up fully,\" AlTai says. From a career standpoint, honoring your energy could mean designing your work week around the times you're most productive, taking walks in between meetings or blocking off certain times on your calendar to allow uninterrupted focus.Another important habit is to \"celebrate your wins,\" she says. As a leadership coach, AlTai noticed a pattern among many of her \"really ambitious\" clients: They were \"always moving the goalpost,\" she says.Instead of taking time to enjoy their successes, her clients immediately started working toward their next goal. That mindset makes it \"very tricky\" to feel satisfied with your accomplishments, according to AlTai.AlTai encourages taking time to rest after reaching a major milestone. \"In those quiet moments, you take inventory, you take stock, you see what worked, what you loved, what you didn't love, what you would do differently, and then you rise again,\" she says.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (not seen) and the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak during a joint press conference after their official meeting at the Presidential Complex in Ankara, Turkiye on November 19, 2025.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkrainian officials have spent the weekend scrambling to make up lost ground when it comes to talks with the U.S. over a peace plan to end the war with Russia, with Kyiv having to tread a fine line between showing the U.S. it's willing to engage in discussions, while anxious to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials were held in Switzerland over the weekend after it emerged last week that Russia and the White House had held secret discussions and had devised a 28-point peace plan which largely favored Moscow's demands.The plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial conditions, including that Ukraine make territorial and military concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region and reducing its army by 50%, as well as other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"While media reports about the \"peace plan\" were initially met with a grim silence by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his European allies, some analysts said it amounted to a capitulation to Russia's maximalist territorial demands.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Kyiv to respond to the plan by Thursday and Russian President Vladimir Putin signalled his approval of the plan, saying it formed the \"basis of a final peace settlement.\"Breaking his silence on the proposals last Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history and was essentially facing a choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.Pressured talksTrump turned the screws on Saturday, posting on Truth Social that Ukraine had shown \"zero gratitude\" for the U.S.' peace efforts, adding an extra layer of presidential pressure to talks held between the U.S and Ukraine on Sunday.While giving few details away, the discussions, which involved U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and a Ukrainian delegation led by Zelenskyy's top aide Andriy Yermak, appear to have gone well. Rubio told reporters that both sides had made \"tremendous progress\" with negotiators having drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" that would be worked on this week.While Ukraine may have accepted that NATO membership is unlikely (and this is one of Russia's key demands) this means that post-war security guarantees are crucial for Kyiv.Read moreUkraine has also pushed back on ceding partially occupied Ukrainian territory to Russia and its European allies fearing that Russia would only re-group and stage another invasion in future to capture more of Ukraine. Kyiv has repeated its stance that it needs a \"just and lasting peace\" and not an agreement that won't stand the test of time.Asked about U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees being included in the document, Rubio was vague but told reporters on Sunday:\"I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as if it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again. So that's clearly something that has to be discussed. I think we've made substantial progress on that and other points.\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to journalists at the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport after the G7 foreign ministers meeting, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Nov. 12, 2025. Mandel Ngan | Via ReutersRubio conceded that the progress of talks with Ukraine was contingent on Russia's approval, stating: \"No matter what we came up with today, obviously, we now have to take what we come up with, if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side to the Russian side, that's another part of this equation. They have to agree to this in order for this to work.\"On Monday, Trump appeared to question progress in talks, posting on Truth Social, \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don't believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said.Red linesFor his part, Zelenskyy said the talks were \"substantive\" and said on social media on Monday that, \"right now, it is crucial that every joint action with our partners is throughly thought out. All decisions must be doable in order to ensure lasting peace and guaranteed security ... Together, we will certainly safeguard our shared interests and our people.\"Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told CNBC Monday that he hoped the latest talks would be fruitful but that security guarantees were \"absolutely vital.\"\"There are some things in this proposal [peace plan] which are unacceptable for Ukraine, there are some things which should be changed but, in general, finally we have a framework and we should work on it and improve it and that's diplomacy,\" Goncharenko told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowAside from security guarantees, other red lines for Ukraine related to the proposal, in the original 28-point plan, that its armed forces hand over parts of the Donbas region, including several large, fortified cities, that they still control.\"I think this is something that's unacceptable for Ukraine because we can't just leave our people,\" Goncharenko said. \"The freezing of the conflict, the peace deal should be reached on the current [front] line, that is something which has been said many times and I think we need to stick to this,\" he said.",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesOn Microsoft's earnings call last month, CEO Satya Nadella boasted about the company's artificial intelligence products, and said over 150 million people are using its Copilot assistant for productivity, cybersecurity, coding and other endeavors.But conversations with IT buyers at Microsoft's Ignite conference in San Francisco this week highlighted some of the hurdles the company must overcome as it tries to sell its AI chatbot in the enterprise market.\"I know a lot of customers who are like, 'Yeah, I want 300 to go to zero,'\" said Adam Mansfield of consulting firm UpperEdge, referring to Copilot licenses. Mansfield, who helps companies negotiate Microsoft deals, said those clients are saying, \"I don't even want it.\"Microsoft started selling the commercial version of 365 Copilot two years ago for $30 per person per month, as an add-on to its broader productivity suite. The chatbot can answer a user's questions based on information stored in corporate systems and can run alongside Microsoft apps, summarizing email threads, creating formatted presentations and capturing key points from calls.Microsoft is competing in AI on multiple fronts, with its heftiest investment coming out of its Azure cloud infrastructure business. Alongside a $13 billion bet on OpenAI, Microsoft is the AI startup's key cloud provider. In October OpenAI announced a $250 billion commitment. Microsoft said revenue growth at Azure reached 40% in the latest quarter, topping the growth rate at Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud business. AI agents present a different challenge. Instead of paying for the infrastructure needed to run hefty workloads, customers are buying a new tool for their employees, and the return on that investment isn't yet clear, according to a number of clients and consultants interviewed by CNBC.  watch nowAdobe, Google, Salesforce, Workday and other vendors are also trying to sell agents to corporations, schools and governments, creating a crowded market for a still nascent technology. OpenAI and Anthropic not only have popular AI models but are increasingly catering to businesses with new services as well.Eon, a Sequoia-backed cloud backup startup, runs its software in Azure. CEO Ofir Ehrlich said Microsoft has broadened Azure's appeal for software developers and operations specialists. But the company isn't standardizing on Microsoft's AI software. It relies on AI coding tools from startups Cognition and Cursor and multiple AI assistants, said Ehrlich, who previously sold startup CloudEndure to Amazon.Google's Gemini has been making rapid advancements in the market. This week, the company debuted its latest model, Gemini 3, which it says will deliver better answers to more complex questions.\"We just had a massive 16,000-employee company move all their mail back to Google so they can leverage more Gemini,\" said Julian Hamood, founder of Microsoft partner TrustedTech.Microsoft declined to comment. More discounts?Hamood said one thing Microsoft could do is provide incentives to help companies and partners pay for data-cleaning projects that would make Copilot more valuable. Microsoft has offered some clients 50% off of the $30 list price for Copilot, he said. \"But they're starting to lean away from the Copilot discounts,\" Hamood said.Tim Crawford, a former IT executive who now advises chief information officers, said many customers aren't getting enough from Copilot to justify the cost. \"Am I getting $30 of value per user per month out of it?\" he said. \"The short answer is no, and that's what's been holding further adoption back.\"Starting in December, a Microsoft 365 Copilot Business tier will become available at $21 per person per month for organizations with up to 300 end users, the company announced at Ignite this week.It's not all doom and gloom for Copilot, as Microsoft still has an advantage with its expansive user base.Nadella said on the latest earnings call that \"more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot,\" though he didn't provide an average number of users at those companies. He named five companies and a U.K. government department that each bought over 15,000 seats in the quarter, adding that most enterprise clients continued to come back for more.Land O'Lakes butter is displayed in a supermarket in New York on Feb. 15, 2017.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThis year, butter maker Land O'Lakes rolled out Microsoft 365 Copilot to all of its nearly 5,000 knowledge workers, after initially granting access to about 20% of them. A small number of employees also have Gemini subscriptions.Land O'Lakes has long relied on Microsoft software and now runs over 70% of its infrastructure in Azure, said Teddy Bekele, the company's technology chief, in an interview at Ignite.Software engineers at Land O'Lakes used the GitHub Copilot AI automated programming software to build custom project and portfolio management software, Bekele said, adding that the company stopped paying for an off-the-shelf product.Now Land O'Lakes is testing Oz, an assistant for retail agronomists who advise farmers. The company developed it with Microsoft Foundry software. Oz can save Land O'Lakes money as it replaces older applications, Bekele said.'Natural choice'Education publisher Pearson, meanwhile, has turned on Microsoft 365 Copilot for all of its 18,000 employees. The company uses Windows, Office and Azure products, as well as Amazon and Google cloud services, technology chief Dave Treat said at the conference. At Ignite, Pearson announced Communication Coach, an agent that will provide personalized learning recommendations through Copilot based on Teams calls, with help from OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model. \"Microsoft is dominant in the enterprise,\" Treat said. \"It was a natural choice if we're thinking about how to train people in communication in the workplace.\"Microsoft is also adding more models into the fold. On Tuesday, Microsoft said Anthropic is bringing its Claude Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 to Microsoft Foundry. Anthropic committed to spend $30 billion on Azure.\"Before today, we didn't have access to all the models from Anthropic,\" Treat said. \"Now we do. That's a big improvement.\"Still, Mansfield said competition has intensified this year, and some companies have been more seriously evaluating alternatives to Microsoft's AI products.\"Microsoft is trying to catch up, quite honestly,\" Mansfield said. \"That's not what a monopoly typically has to do. They're not comfortable. Their sales reps actually now have to learn to sell.\"According to Microsoft, the technology is getting more traction internally. Around 70% of commercial sales, support and partner services workers now use Microsoft 365 Copilot daily, up from 20% a year ago, said Pam Maynard, the company's chief AI transformation officer. \"We've got the 30% daily active usage to get after,\" Maynard said in an interview. \"I do believe we'll get there, and it's just part of change management and helping people to develop that habit.\"WATCH: Microsoft CEO of commercial business on Anthropic, Nvidia partnershipwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

The index closed Friday's session down more than 3.4%. Germany's Rheinmetall, Hensoldt and Renk were all off around 4% at around 10:35 a.m. London time (5:35 a.m. ET), slipping to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index. Sweden's Saab fell 3.5%.  Europe's benchmark natural gas prices, meanwhile, fell below 30 euros ($34.59) per megawatt hour on Friday morning, notching an 18-month low.It comes after the U.S. said Sunday that there had been progress in peace talks at the weekend, which were attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, but that no agreement was reached on security guarantees for Ukraine.The U.S. and Ukraine agreed that the consultations were \"highly productive,\" the countries said in a joint statement released on Sunday.The European Union, for its part, has laid out its own objectives in ensuring sustainable peace in Ukraine. The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said on Sunday that key conditions include no forced border changes and no limitations on Kyiv's armed forces.These elements appear to challenge some of the proposals put forward under a widely leaked U.S. plan for peace. Washington had reportedly proposed that Ukraine cede land including Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and pledge never to join the NATO military alliance.The plan also purportedly said Kyiv would receive \"reliable\" security guarantees, while the size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces would be limited to 600,000 personnel, according to The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the draft proposal.Analysts were doubtful that the U.S. plan, which is thought to be favorable toward Russia, would be backed by Ukraine.A structural position?Analysts were somewhat surprised by the moves lower for European defense stocks. \"The market reaction to potential peace deals have been overstated thus far,\" Loredana Muharremi, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said on Monday. \"Even if there is a deal agreed, the sector should not see a market shock drop, as European defence valuations are underpinned by structural increases in defence budgets across Europe, rather than by short-term revenues from Ukraine,\" Muharremi said. Separately, Ben Gutteridge, market insights strategist at Invesco, said it was a \"perfectly reasonable\" view to expect that Russia may become yet more confident in its geopolitical strategy over the medium term. \"I think … I would share that the structural story for buying defense stocks, sort of, still seems in place to me. The spheres of influence are looking ever more tense and, therefore, defensive stocks have a structural position in portfolios,\" Gutteridge told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday. \"The geopolitical outlook, in the short term, looks a little more encouraging but for medium and long term, it still looks precarious,\" he added.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump offered praise for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday after the two men met for the first time at the White House to discuss the growing issue of affordability.While the Republican president and the Democratic mayor-elect have hurled searing attacks at each other in the recent past, they repeatedly shrugged off those words while appearing side by side in the Oval Office. At one point, when Mamdani was asked for the second time about having called Trump a \"fascist,\" the president gave him cover.\"That's OK, you can just say yes,\" Trump said after Mamdani began to respond. \"It's easier than explaining it.\"Trump also appeared to backtrack on his prior threat to withhold federal funding for New York City if Mamdani became its mayor. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Trump said.Instead of rehashing their feud, they talked up their areas of agreement on broad issues, especially focusing on lowering the cost of living.But they also found common ground on some more specific matters, such as getting NYC-based energy giant Con Edison to lower prices. \"We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison, and we're going to have to talk to them ... to start lowering the rates,\" Trump said. \"Absolutely,\" Mamdani added.U.S. President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media as they meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.

Mamdani had laced into the president on the campaign trail and in his electoral victory speech, saying, \"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.\"And just two days earlier, Trump had called Mamdani the \"Communist Mayor of New York City.\" The mayor-elect is a self-described democratic socialist who denies being a communist.The Oval Office meeting was requested by Mamdani, the 34-year-old whose stunning triumph in the mayoral race over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has put him at the center of American politics.\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight-and-a-half million people who call the city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.Mamdani and other Democrats who won a bevy of elections this month had focused relentlessly on affordability — a word that Trump has chafed at, while insisting that prices are broadly down already.Meanwhile, the president's approval ratings have fallen precipitously in numerous polls, with respondents consistently pointing to the high cost of living as a main concern.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.     ",

    "body": "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo star in Universal's \"Wicked: For Good.\"UniversalUniversal's \"Wicked: For Good\" defied gravity at the box office, snaring an estimated $150 million from domestic ticket sales.It marks the second-highest opening weekend for a film released in 2025, just behind Warner Bros.' \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which tallied $163 million back in April. It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.An estimated 10 million tickets were sold for \"Wicked: For Good\" during opening weekend, topping the 8 million sold during the opening of \"Wicked\" last year, according to data from EntTelligence. The box office data company also reported that 30% of domestic screenings were in premium large format theaters, up from 18% for \"Wicked.\" These tickets are more expensive than general admission and can help bolster blockbuster releases. EntTelligence noted that general tickets for \"Wicked: For Good\" averaged at around $15.25 each while tickets for premium screens averaged at $18.75 a piece.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWill Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta halted internal research that purportedly showed that people who stopped using Facebook became less depressed and anxious, according to a legal filing that was released on Friday. The social media giant was alleged to have initiated the study, dubbed Project Mercury, in late 2019 as a way to help it \"explore the impact that our apps have on polarization, news consumption, well-being, and daily social interactions,\" according to the legal brief, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The filing contains newly unredacted information pertaining to Meta. The newly released legal brief is related to high-profile multidistrict litigation from a variety of plaintiffs, such as school districts, parents and state attorneys general against social media companies like Meta, Google's YouTube, Snap and TikTok. The plaintiffs claim that these businesses were aware that their respective platforms caused various mental health-related harms to children and young adults, but failed to take action and instead misled educators and authorities, among several allegations. \"We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture,\" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement. \"The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens' experiences.\" A Google spokesperson said in a statement that \"These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true.\" \"YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends,\" the Google spokesperson said. \"We've also developed dedicated tools for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.\" Snap and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 2019 Meta research was based on a random sample of consumers who stopped their Facebook and Instagram usage for a month, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit alleged that Meta was disappointed that the initial tests of the study showed that people who stopped using Facebook \"for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison.\" Meta allegedly chose not to \"sound the alarm,\" but instead stopped the research, the lawsuit said.\"The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study,\" according to the suit. \"Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.\"The lawsuit cites an unnamed Meta employee who allegedly said, \"If the results are bad and we don't publish and they leak, is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?\"Stone, in a series of social media posts, pushed back on the lawsuit's implication that Meta shuttered the internal research after it allegedly showed a causal relationship between its apps and adverse mental-health effects.Stone characterized the 2019 study as flawed and said it was the reason that the company expressed disappointment. The study, Stone said, merely found that \"people who believed using Facebook was bad for them felt better when they stopped using it.\"\"This is a confirmation of other public research (\"deactivation studies\") out there that demonstrates the same effect,\" Stone said in a separate post. \"It makes intuitive sense but it doesn't show anything about the actual effect of using the platform.\"CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed reporting.WATCH: Final trades: Meta, S&P Global and Idexx Lab.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the McDonald's Impact Summit at the Westin Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 17, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is \"laying siege on the minimum wage.\" Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass.Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. \"I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted,\" said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. \"If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages.\" California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot.For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it.

Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesBroadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending.\"What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now,\" said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter.\"For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money,\" said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation.Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food \"unaffordable for many.\"Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said.To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers.\"The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it,\" he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. \"Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified,\" Harper-Howie said. \"That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers.\"Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's.But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said.For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are \"significantly more profitable\" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity.Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves.Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.A lifeline for workersAn employee hands items to a customer at the drive-thru of a Jack in the Box restaurant in Los Angeles, California, US, on Monday, April 1, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the mandated pay hike brings another challenge for restaurant operators, workers see it as a win, even if it means fewer scheduled hours.For Zane Marte, 28, the pay bump meant that he could offer more support to his family and buy some of his own groceries, rather than leaning on his parents.Marte worked for Jack in the Box in the San Jose area for seven years. When he started, he earned $12 an hour. Over time, his pay crept up, lifted by raises and eventually a promotion to a management position. Still, until the $20 fast-food wage went into effect, his hourly pay was still several dollars below the new pay floor. His experience aligns with research from the University of California Berkeley's Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy found that the average pre-policy wage for fast-food workers in California was $17.13 an hour, suggesting that the average hourly pay hike after the $20 minimum took effect was about 17%. A separate report from the University of Kentucky published in April found that hiring for fast-food jobs fell after the new pay floor was implemented. However, turnover shrank as the higher wages encouraged workers to stick around. That decline in turnover offset a slowdown in hiring for fast-food workers in California, according to the report.Historically, turnover has been a major problem for the fast-food industry. Hiring and training new workers is expensive and time consuming for operators. For his part, Marte left Jack in the Box months after receiving the raise after he said he grew \"fed up\" with his manager. He has since left California and found employment using his college degree.Before the higher minimum wage went into effect, one concern from operators and trade groups was that other restaurants not included in the policy would have to raise their own wages to stay competitive — which critics said could be particularly hard for small businesses. But that fear largely doesn't seem to have been realized.The Berkeley study did not find any evidence of a spillover into the wages of workers at full-service restaurants chains such as Denny's, Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin and Outback Steakhouse. And more broadly, the researchers from the University of Kentucky did not find evidence that other non-food, low-wage employers raised their pay. The slowdown in fast-food hiring meant that other employers didn't have to worry much about their workers leaving for those jobs. Research from the Shift Project, a partnership between Harvard and the University of California San Francisco, found that the wage hike did not result in employers cutting scheduled hours or lead to understaffing in the immediate aftermath of the policy. Anecdotally, however, some fast-food restaurants have cut back their hours. For example, Julia Gonzalez, 21, lives in Los Angeles and works at Pizza Hut and Yoshinoya, a Japanese fast-food chain with roughly 100 locations in California. She told CNBC that she's been scheduled for fewer hours, but the increased wages still mean that she's able to save more money. (Gonzalez is affiliated with the California Fast Food Workers Union, which was a proponent of the industry's higher minimum wage.)Harper-Howie also told CNBC that her restaurants cut the number of overall labor hours because of slumping sales, as higher menu prices scared away diners.Meanwhile, the number of fast-food job losses caused by the policy is still hotly debated.Analysis of BLS data by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes minimum wage hikes, found that roughly 16,000 fast-food jobs in California have been eliminated since Newsom signed the law in September 2024. However, Reich and Sosinskiy reported no related job losses using employment data that was adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, citing California's more temperate climate than the rest of the country.For his part, Newsom, widely believed to be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election, still includes it in lists of his policy wins as California governor.\"After raising the minimum wage for workers, California now has 750,500 fast food jobs — the MOST in state history! California's fast food industry continues to boom every single month with workers finally receiving the wages they deserve,\" he wrote in a post on X in August last year.",

Sean Rayford | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans.Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices.Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. ",

    "body": "A picture taken on December 8, 2014 in Abidjan shows a Chinese shoe dealer in a transaction at Adjamene's market. Sia Kambou | Afp | Getty ImagesChinese business dealings in Africa, once dominated by state-owned enterprises, are now increasingly shifting toward consumer products from the private sector.While Africa's faster-growing economies, such as Kenya, Uganda and Zambia, see annual growth rates of 4.8%, 6.4% and 5.8%, respectively, the GDP of the overall continent's 50-plus countries is 4.1%. That is according to IMF's economic outlook report last month. Chinese investments in Africa's resource-intensive sectors have declined by roughly 40% since their 2015 peak, amid weaker returns and falling construction revenues in traditional commodity industries, according to Rhodium Group China Cross-Border Monitor released on Nov. 18 this year. Meanwhile, China's exports to Africa have surged by 28% year-on-year over the first three quarters of 2025, following a 57% increase from 2020 to 2024, the report said. Most of those products are higher-value-added manufactured goods such as electronics, plastics and textiles. \"In the early days, Chinese companies that went over were doing a lot more infrastructure, and they were also doing a lot of the natural minerals mining,\" said Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey Greater China.\"In the last few years, I think people are trying to think of the African consumer market,\" he said. But he cautioned that market fragmentation and thin margins can make these ventures difficult. The shift comes as the first G20 summit ever held on the continent kicked off over the weekend in South Africa. While the U.S. only sent its acting ambassador, Chinese Premier Li Qiang represented Beijing, creating more high-level opportunities for business discussions. watch nowIn contrast to prior years when people in China didn't know much about what was happening in Africa, today there are \"more business trips, sending more employees overseas. It just feels more involved,\" said Heather Li, founder and China-Africa consultant at The Dot Connector. She noted that, increasingly, larger Chinese companies are sending decision-makers to Africa to explore specific market opportunities.Due to power shortages in West Africa, Li said Chinese solar products are welcomed there, while medical supplies, along with baby and household products, are also popular across the continent.Already, Chinese smartphone company Transsion has built its business in Africa over the years, while telecoms giant Huawei and household appliance company Midea have also expanded in Africa.In July, Chinese state media reported that the Midea group signed an agreement with the Confederation of African Football, which will increase investments in the area. The company has already built factories in Egypt and has plans for more. Growing Chinese social media attentionThe evolving landscape is evident not only in investment data but also in experiences shared by Chinese entrepreneurs online. On social media platforms like Xiaohongshu and Bilibili, posts over the past year portray Africa as an emerging destination for smaller, agile business ventures spanning dropshipping and e-commerce, as well as manufacturing and retail tied to Chinese supply chains.One earphone and data-cable trader described relocating from China to Nigeria and his search for African partners, while another social media account documented the progress of a business owner's bubble tea business in Kenya. The social media posts also show entrepreneurs selling slippers, small appliances, furniture, and press-on nails. Joseph Keshi, a Nigerian-born real estate investor and business strategist who has worked closely with Chinese entrepreneurs, said some of them earned as much as six-figure U.S. dollars in their first year. While Li cautioned that some might be exaggerating on social media, she noted that the exposure might amplify Chinese awareness of the opportunities in Africa.Euromonitor data affirmed the trend is happening on a larger scale — highlighting how many Chinese ventures in Africa sell basic consumer goods such as diapers, household items, packaged sauces and snacks. \"With a rapidly urbanizing, youthful, and increasingly connected population, household spending across the continent is projected to exceed US$2 trillion by 2030,\" Christy Tawii, regional insight manager at Euromonitor International, said in a statement.She also pointed to the rise of e-commerce platforms such as Chinese Supermarket, which expand the reach of Asian and Chinese brands to African households. Many of these entrepreneurs are optimistic that greater use of the Chinese yuan in Africa could lower transaction risks and deepen commercial ties. Currently, the Chinese yuan is used in \"30% of trade invoicing,\" according to Rhodium's report. But Rhodium Group and Atlantic Council say there's a \"structural ceiling\" to increased use of the Chinese yuan, citing China's trade surplus with most of its African partners and the global reliance on the U.S. dollar. Exports-only pitfallsThe rise of Chinese consumer businesses' interest in Africa comes as profit margins narrow at home due to slowing economic growth and intense competition.Selling to Africa's consumers also becomes more attractive to Chinese companies as they face trade barriers with the U.S. and Europe, Rhodium Group pointed out. The analysts laid out a \"stagnation scenario\" in which Chinese exports increasingly flow to regions such as Africa if China fails to resolve its overcapacity issues and faces further restrictions in Europe.While cheap imports benefit consumers, in Africa as in other parts of the world, a surge of low-cost exports can undermine local manufacturing and deepen trade imbalances. \"It'll be necessary to see Africa as not just a consumer market, but as a market that produces the goods that the continent itself will consume,\" said Ebipere Clark, visiting fellow and consultant at the African Policy Research Institute.Some Chinese companies are already starting to produce locally. \"There is more push for industrialization in Africa,\" The Dot Connector's Li said. \"I was involved in some consulting projects to attract Chinese light industries to move the manufacturing in Africa, and they also have priority access to U.S. and Europe markets.\"Guangzhou-based trading company Sunda International sells a range of products from agricultural tools to daily consumer goods, and claims to have ramped up its construction of more than 20 production centers in Africa over the last decade.Sunda reportedly earns up to $450 million annually by supplying Africa's necessity markets such as baby diapers and sanitary pads.Several of Sunda's listed factories are in Zambia. That's where Premier Li last week signed a $1.4 billion agreement to modernize a railway linking the country to the Indian Ocean with the aim of significantly expanding freight volumes.",

    "body": "It's safe to say that no one is crazy about passwords. For chief information security officers, there's the nightmare of employees leaving lists of passwords on their desks or putting them on Post-it notes on their computers. For workers, there's the inconvenience of having to enter multiple passwords to gain access to various devices and resources.Passwordless authentication technology is designed to address these issues, and use of these tools is on the rise. A recent survey of 200 CISOs by Wakefield Research, sponsored by security vendor Portnox, showed that a significant majority (92%) of the security leaders said their organizations had implemented or were planning to implement passwordless authentication. That's up from 70% in 2024. CISOs cited improved employee productivity and enhanced user experience as the top benefits.Passwordless authentication verifies user identity without the need for traditional passwords, through alternative methods such as hardware tokens, biometrics, or mobile push notifications. It offers potential benefits such as enhanced security and improved user experience.Training services provider Universal Technical Institute has begun using a passwordless platform from Microsoft, \"and as we expand adoption, the benefits show up quickly, with fewer password resets, fewer service desk tickets, and a faster start to the day,\" said Adrienne DeTray, senior vice president and CIO at the company.\"The bigger impact is cultural,\" DeTray said. \"It shows that we're serious about making technology feel lighter and more human again. Over the years, we've added so many systems and logins that the weight of technology has become part of the work. This is one of those steps that helps remove that administrative drag and makes the ecosystem feel more seamless and connected.\"It's not just about security, DeTray said, but user experience as well. \"Every password reset or lockout slows people down and chips away at their focus,\" she said. \"Passwordless takes that friction out of the day and gives people time back. It's part of designing a connected ecosystem where security and usability work hand in hand.\"MFA losing status as 'gold standard' cybersecurityR Systems International, a provider of digital product engineering services, is in the midst of a phased migration to a passwordless environment, said CTO Srikara Rao. \"For us, this isn't about chasing a trend, it's a direct response to the fact that our previous gold standard, multi-factor authentication, is showing its age,\" Rao said. \"The threat landscape has evolved past what traditional MFA can handle.\"R Systems' decision to make the move is driven by both security and business enablement factors. \"Credential-based attacks remain the top threat vector, with a significant rise in phishing attempts and several near-miss incidents underscoring the urgency to act,\" Rao said. \"We want to promote solutions within our organization that are phishing resistant.\"On the operational side, password resets have become quite expensive, Rao said. Resets can be costly due to direct labor expenses and significant indirect costs such as lost employee productivity and IT resource drain. Research firm Forrester estimates that a single password reset can cost $70, and this can add up quickly for large enterprises.In addition, it's critical that the company adhere to compliance requirements such as PCI 4.0, which mandates that users reauthenticate everything they restart or access. \"Passwordless authentication will make it seamless,\" Rao said. \"And finally, as we compete for top tech and cybersecurity talent, being a passwordless enterprise signals that we're a forward-thinking, security-first organization.\"Bring-your-own-device policies are a factorHealth-care services provider Diversus Health is also moving to passwordless authentication, using the technology in the form of certificate-based network access control.\"Due to recently adopting a bring-your-own-device policy, our internal annual HIPAA compliance audit detected lack of network access control as one of our high-risk threats,\" said Neil Ford, IT security administrator. \"So, we began looking into solutions that could be used to mitigate the threat.\"Diversus Health earlier this year deployed a system from Portnox that uses certificate-based authentication to verify the identity of devices. \"We deploy the certificate through a cloud-based endpoint management solution, so verification with Portnox is transparent to staff,\" Ford said.The solution has effectively mitigated the threat of unknown devices connecting to the company's network and being able to access internal resources, Ford said.One of the keys to a successful adoption of passwordless authentication is to effectively communicate the security change with staffers. \"Employees are overcoming decades of password muscle memory and addressing legitimate user anxiety about 'what if I lose my device?' is critical,\" Rao said. \"We learned quickly that we had to sell the 'why' to our employees.\"Enterprises need to frame passwordless authentication not as another security mandate, but as a direct benefit to employees through less frustration, faster logins, and the elimination of password resets, Rao said. Before making the shift, R Systems ran small, interactive training sessions to get people comfortable with access tools such as fingerprint identification on their phones.\"I cannot stress enough the importance of organizations providing user education,\" Rao. \"It's a significant difference between a successful deployment and a shelfware investment.\"R Systems passwordless strategy isn't tied to a single vendor, but built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn open standards, \"giving us flexibility to choose the right tool for each risk profile,\" Rao said. \"Privileged users such as administrators, developers, and executives use FIDO2 hardware security keys, while the broader workforce relies on passkeys integrated with device biometrics like Windows Hello and Face ID.\"The company is still evaluating the results of the transition to passwordless authentication and working to ensure that it works best for everyone.\"We've seen our employee experience improve dramatically, with faster logins and a significant reduction in password-related help desk tickets,\" Rao said. \"Most importantly, passwordless authentication has become a cornerstone of our zero-trust architecture, giving us a stronger, high-assurance identity layer that enables secure access regardless of user or device location.\"",

Although college graduates are still less likely to be unemployed than their non-degree counterparts, the advantage is smaller than it's been in decades. Job market worsens for recent gradsFor recent college graduates, the cracks are starting to show. Some large employers have said they're replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence in order to streamline operations and cut costs. Concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending are also likely contributors to an erosion of entry-level opportunities, other research shows.Although members of the Class of 2025 submitted more job applications than did their 2024 counterparts — 10 and six, respectively — they received fewer job offers on average than did the previous class, with mean numbers of .78 and .83, respectively, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found. NACE's study, conducted April 1-May 30, 2025, surveyed 1,479 graduating seniors.According to a report by education technology company Cengage Group, in its  survey conducted in June and July 2025 only 30% of 2025 graduates said they had secured a full-time job in their field and only 41% of the Class of 2024 said they had done so. The survey included 971 recent graduates across the U.S.\"These workers are a vital part of the labor market, and if they're having a hard time, that means the economy could be having a hard time,\" said Indeed's Stahle.The market for 2026 graduates could be as bad or worse. Employers are less optimistic about the overall job market for upcoming grads than they were in the last several years, according to a separate report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. About half, or 51%, of employers rated the job market for this year's college seniors as poor or fair, the highest share since 2020-21.'A long-term scarring impact'A weak labor market can have a negative effect on younger workers' economic well-being over time, particularly in terms of wage growth and earning potential, according to Oxford's report.\"Unemployment is rising and wage growth is declining for young adults, which could have a long-term scarring impact,\" said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics and author of the report. \"If these workers have a hard time getting into jobs now ... that also impacts their earning capabilities,\" Stahle said. \"You start to add these things together and it really can lead to further widening in income inequality.\" \"There are big economic implications down the road,\" he said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

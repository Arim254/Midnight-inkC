    "body": "Amid fears of AI disrupting white-collar jobs, many workers are wondering how to stay relevant and safeguard their careers. Adam Grant recently shared his own two cents on the matter.Grant, a bestselling author and organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, shared his biggest piece of advice for future-proofing your career while speaking at WOBI's World Business Forum in New York City on Nov. 5.\"For those of you who are thinking about how to future-proof your career or how to make your company more resilient in a time of chaos and crisis, I know of no better advice than to think like a scientist,\" he said.By that, Grant means \"recognizing every opinion you hold in your job is just a hypothesis waiting to be tested.\"\"It might have been true in the past, but it may not hold in the present,\" he said. \"It might have been true in one environment, but it doesn't apply to the current environment you're in or to the future you're about to confront.\"Three types of thinking to avoidGrant said leaders frequently fall into one of three camps based on their mindsets: preacher, prosecutor or politician. He's not referring to people in those professions, of course, but to people whose modes of thinking resemble those.A preacher, for example, is \"basically proselytizing their own views,\" Grant said. A prosecutor, meanwhile, is \"attacking somebody else's views,\" and the leaders he likens to politicians \"don't even bother to listen unless other people already agree with their views.\"On the other hand, leaders who think like scientists don't conflate their ideas with their identity, so they're not afraid to be wrong, learn from their mistakes and change course as needed.\"Good scientists are as motivated to look for reasons why they might be wrong, as opposed to just looking for reasons why they must be right,\" Grant said. \"They have the humility to know what they don't know and the curiosity to keep seeking new knowledge, and we have a growing body of evidence that if we teach people to think more like scientists, they actually make better choices.\"With these leaders, employees feel empowered to speak up and experiment with new ideas, Grant said.\"If you learn to think like a scientist, you end up building a learning culture where people say, 'Hey, we don't know if this is going to work yet, but we think it's worth piloting,' and then you get a chance to see the potential in people and ideas,\" he said.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Julpo | E+ | Getty ImagesWhen it comes time to make a purchase, which credit card you use could soon determine how much you pay.A new settlement announced this week would end a longstanding dispute between businesses and Visa and Mastercard over credit card \"swipe\" fee practices.Swipe fees are charged to retailers, service providers and other merchants each time a customer uses their card. Banks and card companies typically levy about 2% or more for every transaction, according to the National Retail Federation. Previously, merchants had to \"honor all cards\" on a network — for example, if they accept one Visa credit card, then they must accept all Visa cards regardless of swipe fee rates charged. Under the proposed settlement, they can reject those cards with high fees to save their bottom line. What's more, merchants may be able to charge customers different fees depending on which credit card they use. \"This is a fight between banks and merchants, and consumers are caught in the middle,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageIRS announces 2026 401(k) contribution limits, raises savings capIRS unveils 2026 IRA contribution limits, raises savings capIRS announces 401(k) catch-up contributions for 2026, raises capIRS unveils Roth IRA income limits for 2026What the Visa, MasterCard settlement means for your rewards credit cardWhere SNAP benefits stand amid negotiations to end the government shutdownWhy the AI stock boom mainly benefits the wealthyBoomers are less bullish on ETFs than younger generations — with good reasonTrump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks: Here's what you need to knowThis is the 'biggest mistake' you can make with your IRA, attorney saysConsumers on edge as ACA 'subsidy cliff' looms: 'Quite frankly, it's terrifying'How to have tricky money talks as a couple: 'Money Together' authorsAmid FAA order flight cancellations, how credit card travel insurance worksThese annuities act like 'bumpers in a bowling lane' to limit losses: advisorAs student loan forgiveness notices go out, here are next steps for borrowersFederal workers at risk of missing more pay as government shutdown continuesCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedRoughly 175 million consumers have at least one credit card, making it the most common method of making a purchase, according to TransUnion. Rewards cards are by far the most popular kind of plastic — about 85% of the credit cards issued today are rewards cards, the National Retail Federation also found.The longstanding battle over swipe feesMerchants have been battling with card issuers over what they've called a \"cartel-like pricing practice\" for two decades, according to Doug Kantor, an executive committee member at the Merchants Payments Coalition. In 2005, retailers and other merchants filed a class-action lawsuit against Visa and Mastercard, which control 80% of the market, alleging that their fees and acceptance terms were anti-competitive. Monday's settlement is the potential conclusion after 20 years of litigation over the fees that banks and credit card companies charge to process payments. \"We believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,\" a spokesperson for Mastercard said in a statement. Visa did not respond to a request for comment.watch nowUnder the settlement, credit cards would be classified into three categories:commercial cardspremium cards, including rewards cardsstandard, no-rewards cardsMerchants could then choose which categories to accept, but must still accept all cards within a category. Merchants can also add a surcharge of up to 3% to customers' bills for paying by credit card. Finally, the settlement caps the fees that banks, as well as Visa and Mastercard, can charge merchants.The proposed settlement is still months away from being put into practice, and it must be approved by the court, which already rejected a previous agreement. But eventually, experts say, changes may be in store for credit card users. watch nowThe settlement could make it more common to have certain rewards cards rejected at some retailers, similar to how Costco doesn't accept American Express cards for purchases, said a person with knowledge of the thinking of a major U.S. bank.This person, who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly, said that the ultimate ramifications weren't yet clear as it involves active litigation. But banks are upset at how the settlement turned out and view this as giving merchants greater leverage when it comes to future negotiations involving the cost of card acceptance.The settlement could cause some merchants to decide not to accept rewards cards, others to start levying surcharges for their use, and banks could also scale back their rewards programs as a result, they said.Near-term outlook: 'Not a lot is going to change'According to experts, it is unlikely that any retailer will choose to reject all rewards cards. Since nearly 90% of all credit card spending is on rewards cards, merchants really have no choice but to continue to accept them, Rossman said: \"In the real world, not a lot is going to change.\"Rejecting some high-cost cards at the point of sale also risks alienating customers who carry them, according to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.For that reason, the proposed settlement is \"all window dressing and no substance,\" the National Retail Federation's chief administrative officer Stephanie Martz said in a statement. \"The reduction in swipe fees doesn't begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing,\" she said.Longer-term outlook: More fees, fewer benefitsOne potential outcome of the settlement is that retailers will tack on an extra fee for customers who pay with rewards cards to help cover the cost. \"You could see a more varied approach to this, which would be surcharging,\" said John Cabell, managing director of payments intelligence at J.D. Power.But more affluent cardholders are already paying a premium. Rewards credit cards generally have higher-than-average interest rates to compensate issuers for the additional perks, in addition to an increasingly common annual fee, which can exceed $500 depending on the card, according to Rossman.In return, customers earn cash back, miles or points, which have become a sought-after differentiator in the card market. \"People love their rewards cards and especially high-income folks,\" said Schulz. Since the settlement calls for Visa and Mastercard to lower swipe fees by 0.1 percentage point for five years, that may make it harder for card issuers to keep boosting benefits. \"About 86% of interchange fees go to card issuers to fund credit card rewards and loyalty programs,\" according to Trent Swanson, a loyalty points consulting adviser who is known as the \"miles husband.\" \"What's often overlooked is that the cost of running rewards programs has already been rising.\"In another scenario, merchants raise prices to cover the cost of accepting cards with higher interchange fees. \"What, in fact, happens is that all of us pay these huge fees in the form of inflated prices and we don't know it,\" said Kantor. \"The cash-paying customer, they get the shortest straw every time.\" While there may not be an immediate change from the settlement, over time, if merchants start adding surcharges and rewards cards become more expensive to use at the point of sale, it could reign in the upward spiral of rewards and benefits that consumers have grown to appreciate, according to J.D. Power's Cabell. Even relatively modest cards might see a reduction in offerings as well if surcharges become generally more prevalent with mid-tier and premium card groupings, Cabell said. \"It is unlikely that this last announcement is the final chapter.\"— Stephanie Dhue and Hugh Son contributed to this report.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump signs funding legislation to reopen the federal government as he is joined by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), Republican lawmakers and business leaders, during a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House on Nov. 12, 2025, in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump late Wednesday signed into law a funding bill to end the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.The measure, which will fund government operations through the end of January, was passed by the House of Representatives earlier Wednesday night in a 222-209 vote.\"The Democrats tried to extort our country,\" Trump said before signing the bill in the Oval Office at the White House to reopen the government after 43 days.Democrats had blocked passage of a funding bill until Sunday, when a bloc of the party's Senate caucus agreed to support a new funding measure in that chamber, despite it not including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits.\"Republicans never wanted a shutdown,\" said the president, who was flanked by GOP leaders of Congress, as well as by business leaders such as Ken Griffin of Citadel, John Paulson, and Masa Son, CEO of SoftBank.\"People were hurt so badly,\" Trump said, noting the more than 1 million federal workers furloughed, and the effect on government services for Americans. \"We can never let this happen again.\"He reiterated his call for the Senate to end a filibuster rule that effectively requires 60 votes to pass legislation, including short-term funding resolutions.Trump did not take questions from reporters after the signing, despite several of them trying to ask about the release by House Democrats earlier in the day of documents from the estate of his former friend, Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex offender. He was asked about, but ignored, a question about emails by Epstein referring to him.Trump has denied knowing about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were friends.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., before Wednesday's vote, in comments backing the bill on the chamber's floor, said, \"My friends, let's get this done.\"U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) holds a news conference after the House passed funding legislation to reopen the federal government, at the Capitol on Nov. 12, 2025 in Washington, DC.Tom Brenner | Getty ImagesJust two Republicans in the House voted against the bill: Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Florida's Greg Steube.All but six Democrats voted against the bill: Adam Gray of California; Maine's Jared Golden; Tom Suozzi of New York; Washington's Marie Gluesenkamp Perez; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Henry Cuellar of Texas.The Office of Management and Budget told federal employees to return to their jobs on Thursday.Earlier Wednesday night, the U.S. Department of Transportation froze the level of flight cuts it imposed in light of shortages of air traffic controllers during the shutdown.As of Tuesday, 6% of scheduled flights were canceled at U.S. airports, and that level was set to rise to 10% by Friday.The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and government operations had remained shuttered since then because Senate Democrats overwhelmingly refused to vote for a funding measure that did not extend the boosted ACA subsidies, which reduce the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for 20 million Americans.The Senate passed the funding bill on Monday night, a day after the Republican majority won support for it from seven Democrats and one independent senator to barely reach the 60-vote minimum.Under the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to allow Democrats a vote in December on a bill of their choice to extend those boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of that month.In addition to short-term funding, the deal will also reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal government employees and ensure that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries that they would have received if the government had not shut down.It is not yet known when all federal employees will be paid, but agencies are expected to roughly follow the timeline for paying House staffers, who are set to receive checks on Tuesday.The package also funds the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps. An EBT sign is displayed on the window of a grocery store on Oct. 30, 2025 in the Flatbush neighborhood of the Brooklyn borough in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration tried to end those food stamp benefits in November, citing the shutdown, and then refused to tap money other than $4.6 billion in a congressionally appropriated contingency fund to fully pay SNAP benefits for the month.The Supreme Court had stayed a federal judge's order mandating that full benefits be paid until Thursday, giving Congress time to effectively moot the case by passing the shutdown bill.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., during remarks on the House floor before the vote, said some people will see their monthly insurance premiums \"double or even triple\" because of the lack of protection for the added ACA subsidies.She said, \"more than 2 million Americans are expected to lose their health plans next year because it is just too expensive.\"DeLauro said that Johnson, the House speaker, \"has shown no interest\" in holding a vote on the ACA subsidies, despite Senate Republicans saying that was the plan.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, \"We never should have been here.\"\"We tried as Republicans more than a month ago to prevent a government shutdown,\" Scalise said.\"We waited for 42 days where time and time again, Democrats, to appease their most radical base, voted to keep that government shut down.\"Scalise said \"millions of Americans\" have had to endure \"pain and suffering\" because Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill.He accused Democrats of hypocrisy by seeking $200 billion in health spending that would benefit \"illegals,\" while \"advocating to gut the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund.\"\"It's insanity,\" Scalise said.",

    "body": "Elon Musk announced his new company xAI, which he says has the goal to understand the true nature of the universe.Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI has raised $15 billion from investors, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber. The funding adds another $5 billion to the $10 billion round CNBC reported on in September, which valued the startup at $200 billion. Sources told CNBC that a lot of the money will fund graphic processing units that underpin large language models.Artificial intelligence startups have reached sky high valuations in recent months as they raise massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for foundational models. In September, AI startup Anthropic closed a $13 billion funding round that roughly tripled its valuation from March. Sam Altman's OpenAI in October closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation. Last month, Reuters reported that the ChatGPT maker was prepping for an IPO that could value it at $1 trillion.

The change applies to 401(k)s, 403(b)s and most 457 plans, along with the federal Thrift Savings Plan. The IRS also unveiled 2026 catch-up contribution limits for savers age 50 and older, new individual retirement account savings limits and higher income thresholds for Roth IRA contributions.  Starting in 2026, the 401(k) catch-up contribution limit will rise to $8,000 for savers 50 and older, from $7,500 in 2025. But investors aged 60 to 63 can instead save an extra $11,250, based on changes enacted via Secure 2.0.

    "body": "Starbucks employees participate in an open-ended strike, as part of a nationwide push for improved wages and benefits, in New York City, U.S., November 13, 2025. Eduardo Munoz | ReutersStarbucks Workers United launched an open-ended strike in more than 40 cities Thursday on Red Cup Day, one of the chain's biggest sales days of the year.The protest, which the union says involves more than 1,000 baristas in over 65 stores, comes after Workers United voted to authorize an open-ended strike after baristas and the coffee giant failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement.The strike could hurt business during Starbucks' busy holiday season, which typically provides a sales boost and will be key to the chain's plan to turn around performance in the U.S. under new CEO Brian Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The union is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year.Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. Both sides have pointed blame at the other for failure to reach a bargaining agreement, and say they're ready to negotiate.Workers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 550 stores. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers at 550 cafes.The baristas say they are prepared to escalate the work stoppage, threatening to make this \"the largest, longest strike in company history if Starbucks fails to deliver a fair union contract and resolve unfair labor practice charges.\" It is seeking new proposals that address its top issues to finalize a contract.\"If Starbucks keeps stonewalling a fair contract and refusing to end union-busting, they'll see their business grind to a halt,\" Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen, a former barista who spent 15 years at the company, said in a statement. \"No contract, no coffee is more than a tagline — it's a pledge to interrupt Starbucks operations and profits until a fair union contract and an end to unfair labor practices are won. Starbucks knows where we stand.\"In response to the strike vote results last week, Starbucks previously said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.\"Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. Workers United, which represents only 4% of our partners, chose to walk away from the bargaining table. We've asked them to return—many times. If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CNBC in a statement Monday.In a letter to workers addressing the strike authorization vote last week, Sara Kelly, chief partner officer at Starbucks, echoed the belief that the sides could reach an agreement swiftly.\"For months, we were at the bargaining table, working in good faith with Workers United and delegates from across the country to reach agreements that make sense for partners and for the long-term success of Starbucks,\" Kelly said. \"We reached more than 30 tentative agreements on full contract articles.\"\"Our commitment to bargaining hasn't changed,\" she added. \"Workers United walked away from the table but if they are ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.\"",

And the network isn't as differentiated as it used to be, in large part because everybody's been spending money to put these 5G networks in place,\" Bertolini said. \"So losing 30% share over the last eight years is an issue, and we have to do something different.\"In October, the company announced Schulman would be replacing Vestberg, who had led the company since 2018. In a statement at the time, Schulman said Verizon was at a \"critical juncture\" and that he believed the company had a \"clear opportunity to redefine our trajectory.\"Schulman previously led PayPal through significant revenue growth and has served on Verizon's board of directors since 2018.Vestberg is remaining on the the board of directors until the 2026 annual meeting and serving as a special advisor through Oct. 4, 2026.Bertolini said Thursday that Schulman is evaluating underlying cost structures and other aspects of the company to ensure its success.\"We believe that once we have that plan in place, we'll have a good story,\" Bertolini said. \"The Street reacted early on that there's going to be a price war; I think it's less about price war than the value of what we're offering to people through the product.\"Bertolini added that Schulman will be revealing his plan for turning around the company \"sooner rather than later.\"\"The board needed to act, and we acted,\" Bertolini said.",

Chairman Paul Sciarra told CNBC that the flight showcases Joby's ability to quicky move from \"concept to demonstration\" to meet growing military needs.Joby and L3Harris first said they were collaborating on a military craft with autonomous or piloted capabilities in August.The U.S. government is investing aggressively under the Trump Administration on new autonomous, artificial intelligence and defense technology to improve the military's capabilities. The president has also outlined plans for a $175 billion \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.\"The defense landscape is really changing,\" Sciarra said, adding that it's playing out in conflicts like the war between Russia and Ukraine, \"where commercial technologies are being rapidly deployed.\"Joby, which is widely known for its electric vertical takeoff and landing aircrafts, or eVTOLs, is currently racing to get certified by Federal Aviation Administration to start flying commercially. The company's stock price has doubled this year.Joby is betting big on Saudi Arabia as a major testing ground for its technology, signing an agreement this week to bring its air taxis to the Middle Eastern country.  The company is also working with the United Arab Emirates. The market has gotten a boost from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in June to create an eVTOL pilot program.Archer Aviation, which was named the official air taxi provider for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, has seen its stock surge 86% over the last year and Amazon-backed Beta Technologies debuted on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month.Sciarra said the aircrafts developed with L3Harris are currently geared toward defense companies, but commercial customers could benefit from the technology as Joby builds and tests it.\"We think there is great opportunity for a hybrid version of this aircraft in the commercial context that can compete with single aisle regional transport today,\" he said.Joby plans to let government agencies and departments start testing the vehicles next year.WATCH: Joby to acquire Blade's passenger businesswatch now",

    "body": "Susan Collins, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, during a Bloomberg Television interview at the Kansas City Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Moran, Wyoming, US, on Friday, Aug. 22, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins on Wednesday said she will be reluctant to support further interest rate cuts anytime soon with inflation still high and policymakers hampered by a lack of data due to the government shutdown.\"Given my baseline outlook, it will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment,\" the central bank official said in remarks delivered in her home district. \"I see several reasons to have a relatively high bar for additional easing in the near term.\"Collins's comments are notable because she is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Her remarks put her on the hawkish side of the rate debate, highlighting a fissure among committee members that led Chair Jerome Powell to say in October that a cut at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, despite market pricing of a high probability.Collins supported the quarter percentage point rate cut at the October meeting but indicated that further easing could thwart the Fed's efforts to get inflation lower.While Collins said softness in the labor market \"bears watching,\" she added that the risks of inflation staying above the Fed's 2% target warrant caution.\"Against this backdrop, providing additional monetary support to economic activity runs the risk of slowing – or possibly even stalling – the return of inflation to target,\" she said. \"And with resilient demand, the downside risks to employment, while present, do not seem to have increased further since the summer.\"Collins also noted the role that the government shutdown is playing in her decision making. The impasse appears to be over, but White House press secretary said Wednesday that key reports on inflation and employment may not be available at all for October.\"Absent evidence of a notable labor market deterioration, I would be hesitant to ease policy further, especially given the limited information on inflation due to the government shutdown,\" Collins said.The FOMC in October voted 10-2 for the cut. Governor Stephen Miran voted no because he wanted a bigger reduction, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid opposed because he favored no cut.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Department of Transportation late Wednesday froze flight cuts it imposed less than a week ago as air travel disruptions eased across the U.S., hours before the longest government shutdown ended.The department implemented the freeze before the House approved a funding bill that would keep the government open through January. President Donald Trump signed the bill on Wednesday, the White House said.On Wednesday, 816 U.S. departures were canceled, 3.5% of airlines' schedule, the lowest rate and number of cancellations since last Thursday, according to aviation data firm Cirium.The shutdown again put air travel in the spotlight and heightened strains on air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without receiving their regularly scheduled paychecks. The DOT said Wednesday night in a statement that there was a \"rapid decline\" in callouts from controllers in the last two days.Read more CNBC airline newsAirlines warn flight cancellations will continue even after shutdown endsPrivate-jet demand is on the rise amid government shutdown, says Flexjet CEOBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?Trump administration officials on Friday started requiring airlines to trim their schedules, citing safety risks and additional strain on controllers. The required cancellations rose from 4% of domestic flights at U.S. airports to 6% on Tuesday, blaming increased strain on air traffic controllers. They would have increased to 10% by Friday, but DOT froze the increases on Wednesday night.But the cuts weren't enough to avoid further disruptions that were worsened by widespread staffing shortages and bad weather, leading to an influx of cancellations and delays last weekend.Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the shutdown will have a financial impact on the carrier but it wouldn't come close to wiping out the airline's profits. He warned that he thinks there will be another shutdown at some point and said air traffic controllers should be paid if that happens.watch nowU.S. airline shares were up broadly on Wednesday before the House vote.Thin air traffic controller staffing has been on the rise during the shutdown that started Oct. 1, leading to thousands of flights being slowed or altogether canceled and disrupting travel plans of 5 million passengers, according to Airlines for America, an industry group that represents the largest U.S. carriers. Some air traffic controllers were forced to take second jobs to make ends meet, the controllers' union and government officials have said.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and major airlines this week warned that air travel won't immediately snap back to normal even after the shutdown.\"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel but it depends on controllers coming back to work,\" Duffy said at a news conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday.",

    "body": "A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the US Capitol in Washington, DC, Nov. 12, 2025. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesA petition in the House of Representatives to force a vote to compel the Justice Department to release the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files on Wednesday secured the last signature required to trigger that action.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., within hours said that a full House vote on that effort will be held next week.Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., provided the 218th signature needed to approve the so-called discharge petition shortly after she was sworn in as a House member, after a seven-week delay. Griljalva won a special election to fill the seat vacated due to the death of her father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva, in March.The Trump administration has been under fire for months for reneging on promises to release investigative files related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in 2019 after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.Epstein had been a friend of President Donald Trump for years before they had a falling out in the early 2000s.Even if the effort passes in the House, it is unlikely to become law. The bill would have to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, and Trump could veto it even if it survived a vote in that chamber.The New York Times reported Wednesday that Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, was summoned to the White House to meet with top Justice Department and FBI officials as Trump tries to head off the House vote, The New York Times reported.Boebert is just one of four GOP House members who signed the discharge petition on the Epstein files. files.Jennifer Freeman, an attorney for Epstein victim Maria Farmer, in a statement to MSNBC, said, \"For decades, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have been left in the dark, the government ignored or cast aside survivor reports of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, and the vast majority of people who were implicated have yet to be held responsible.\"\"There's no time to waste – we urge lawmakers to do their part and vote on releasing the Epstein files once and for all,\" Freeman said.House Democrats earlier Wednesday released more than 20,000 documents obtained from Epstein's estate under a subpoena.The documents include emails and text messages in which Epstein talked about Trump.\"I know how dirty donald is,\" Epsten wrote in a 2018 email thread for Kathryn Ruemmler, who served as former President Barack Obama's White House counsel, after she sent Epstein an article about Trump's ex-personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen's pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and agreeing to cooperate in a federal investigation of the president.In a separate April 2019 email released by Democrats, Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.In another newly released email that Epstein wrote to his now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011, Epstein wrote, \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein added in that same email that a person whom the Democrats identified as a victim of his, whose name was redacted in the email, \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added in that message.It is not clear what Epstein was referring to in the email that said \"the dog that hasn't barked.\"CNBC has not independently verified the documents released by the Democrats.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and young women when they were socializing with each other. The president has never been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Trump blasted the Democrats in a Truth Social post that accused them of using the Epstein documents to distract Americans from the cost of the U.S. government shutdown.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" Trump wrote.\"Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap,\" he wrote.\"The Democrats cost our Country $1.5 Trillion Dollars with their recent antics of viciously closing our Country, while at the same time putting many at risk — and they should pay a fair price,\" Trump said.\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\"",

    "body": "A statue of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse stands in a garden in front of Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World on May 31, 2024, in Orlando, Florida.Gary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty ImagesDisney reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped analyst expectations for earnings but missed on revenue as the company's entertainment business was weighed down by its TV networks and a lackluster theatrical film slate.Disney stock fell roughly 8% in early trading Thursday.Here is what Disney reported for the period ended Sept. 27, compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.11 adjusted vs. $1.05 expectedRevenue: $22.46 billion vs. $22.75 billion expectedNet income for the quarter was $1.44 billion, or 73 cents a share, more than double the $564 million, or 25 cents per share, that Disney reported in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items Disney reported earnings per share of $1.11. The company's overall revenue for the quarter was nearly $22.5 billion, slightly less than the same quarter last year. Disney also said it plans to boost its dividend and double its share buyback plan for fiscal 2026.\"Overall we're leaving the year with a lot of momentum,\" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday regarding the company's streaming and experiences businesses.watch nowStreaming strides, linear strugglesRevenue for Disney's entertainment unit fell 6% from last year to $10.21 billion, dragged down by the linear TV networks and theatrical releases. Disney's TV networks, including ESPN, have been unavailable for customers of Google's YouTube TV, a streaming provider of the pay TV bundle since Oct. 31 because of an ongoing carriage dispute between the two companies.Johnston told \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday that Disney is still in the midst of negotiations with YouTube TV, but the company was prepared for what it expected to be a \"challenging battle,\" and Disney is \"ready to go as long as they want to.\"\"We're trying really hard, as I said working tirelessly, to close this deal, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to do so on a timely enough basis to at least give consumers the opportunity to access our content over their platform,\" CEO Bob Iger said on Thursday's call with investors.Advertising revenue for the networks, which includes broadcast network ABC and pay TV channels like FX, also suffered. Part of this was attributable to lower political advertising, or a $40 million impact compared with the same quarter last year, Disney said. The company also noted that its 2024 joint venture deal for India Hotstar impacted its linear network results.Streaming remained the bright spot in the business as consumers continued to turn away from the pay TV bundle. Operating income for the linear networks dropped 21% to $391 million while it rose 39%, to $352 million, for streaming. The higher operating income for streaming occurred as prices increased for Disney's streaming services. Iger on Thursday said the streaming business reported another quarter of profitability growth. He added full-year operating income was $1.3 billion, \"up $1.2 billion from last year and $300 million ahead of our original guidance.\" \"This is a significant achievement when you consider that just three years ago our [streaming] business was running a $4 billion operating loss,\" Iger said. Disney+ was launched in 2019, and similar to its peers, took some years of losses before hitting profitability.Disney's streaming growth was also the result of more options for its services. Earlier this year its carriage deal with Charter Communications broadened, giving the cable TV provider's customers access to ad-supported Hulu. Initially, Charter's pay TV customers had been receiving only Disney+.While about half of the streaming subscriber increase could be attributed to the Charter carriage deal, Johnston said on CNBC that \"the other half was retail,\" with a big portion of that coming from international markets. Disney — like its media peers Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix — has seen most of its recent streaming growth come from global customers.The ESPN app mascot at the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, 2025. NYSEThe company in August also launched its ESPN direct-to-consumer app, which mirrors all the content of the TV networks, ESPN+ and other additions. The app is also available for Charter's pay TV subscribers.On Thursday's investor call, Iger said the new ESPN app helped to attract new users, and said the rate of those with access through pay TV subscriptions using the app \"has been very, very encouraging.\" He also said they were attracting both more advertising and new advertisers to the ESPN app.\"I think it's a very positive step for the future of ESPN because while nothing necessarily provides future proof concepts or circumstances for a business that is constantly changing, this certainly is a step in the direction of solidifying ESPN's future going forward,\" Iger said Thursday.ESPN's earnings are reported in the sports segment, separate from the rest of its TV channels. Despite the continued pay TV bundle customer defections, sports has remained the last bastion of high viewership and big advertising dollars on traditional TV.Disney stopped reporting subscriber metrics for ESPN+, and did not give guidance on the newly launched app that goes by the same name as the TV network. Johnston on CNBC Thursday said the availability of ESPN via streaming has helped to stem customer losses and has also boosted engagement with ESPN.However, Johnston called out Disney's bundles as a driver of the ESPN app and streaming in general.\"One of the things I think we're most excited about is fully 80% of those new retail subs on ESPN are actually bundled subs, which again, should contribute to engagement, should contribute to retention, and frankly make the service more valuable over time,\" Johnston told \"Squawk Box.\"The flagship streaming service Disney+ added 3.8 million paid subscribers, bringing its total to 131.6 million, while Hulu had 64.1 million customers. Disney has been in the process of integrating Hulu — which it took full control of earlier this year — into the Disney+ app. This marks the last time the company will report subscriber numbers and the average revenue per unit, or ARPU, for its streaming services, which includes Disney+ and Hulu.Instead, Disney will follow in the footsteps of streaming behemoth Netflix, which earlier this year stopped updating investors on its subscriber count.Revenue for Disney's sports division, namely ESPN, was up 3% to roughly $4 billion, while operating income was essentially flat at $898 million when compared with the same period last year. ESPN's domestic operating income in particular decreased due to costs associated with the launch of the app in August, as well as higher programming costs. Positive experiencesDisney Cruise Line's Disney Dream is seen docked in Port Canaveral, Florida, on July 30, 2021. (Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Mark Gauert | Sun Sentinel | Getty ImagesRevenue for the experiences segment, which consists of theme parks, resorts and cruises, as well as consumer products, rose 6% to $8.77 billion. Operating income for the segment was up 13% to $1.88 billion. The current economy hasn't affected the Disney consumer when it comes to its experiences business, Johnston said Thursday on \"Squawk Box.\" He noted that bookings are up 3% and spending per person at parks was also up 5% in Disney's fiscal first quarter.\"We've got continued momentum there,\" Johnston said.Disney attributed the gains in its experiences and parks segment to growth in its cruise business, despite being offset by higher fleet expansion costs.Johnston noted cruises are selling out at the same rate that they had before, even though the fleet is bigger. \"So that added capacity is filling up quickly,\" he added.Disney's expanded cruise fleet was highlighted on its Thursday call with investors. Two upcoming ships will join Disney's fleet in the near future, Iger said Thursday, with Disney Destiny setting sail this month and Disney Adventure, the first ship ported in Asia, set to launch in March. Johnston added more about the experiences business on Thursday's call with investors.\"That's not a disclosed item, but obviously it's a very attractive business,\" Johnston said regarding the margins on the cruises segment. \"We're capable of pricing it at a good level. The guest satisfaction scores are higher than basically anything else in the company, so the margins in that business, as you would imagine, are quite attractive.\"Revenue for Disney's domestic parks was up 6% to $5.86 billion, while international parks revenue increased 10% to $1.74 billion. Disney noted that the operating results for Disney's international parks were boosted by growth at Disneyland Paris.Johnston said on Thursday's call that demand for Disney's U.S. parks was in line with expectations, as the company had earlier factored in the opening of Comcast's Epic Universe in Florida this year. However, Johnston said Epic Universe \"seemed to be impacting the rest of the competition in Florida more than it's impacting us.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.",

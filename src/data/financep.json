    "body": "There's a sharp divide between what Gen Z values and what hiring managers are actually looking for.My team at Becoming You Labs recently conducted a study using our values-assessment tool, The Values Bridge, which ranks 16 values using 100 behavioral questions. Since May, over 77,000 people have taken it. We then cross-referenced the study with a national survey of 2,100 hiring managers across industries like tech, consulting, banking, and professional services. (Read more about our research here.)The disconnect was clear — and pretty stark: Gen Z's top three values are self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people. The people hiring them, on the other hand, are looking for employees who value achievement, learning, and hard work. When you cross-reference the two studies, only 2% of Gen Z shares their bosses' priorities.In response to the findings, one CEO said: \"This explains exactly why we can't hire.\" A hospital executive put it more bluntly: \"We are now hiring two or three new docs to replace a retiring one. They tell us we should not be expecting them to work hard because life as a cardiologist isn't what it used to be.\"One head of HR summed all the comments up with the line: \"This is crazy. And confirming.\"Gen Z's response? Starkly different. One recent grad on TikTok: \"Why would we want to live by Boomer values when their values ruined the world?\" Another added: \"Old people hate young people because our lives prove theirs were wasted. I'm not going to wish I worked more on my deathbed.\"The intensity of the debate didn't shock me. I've watched this clash build for years — in classrooms and in boardrooms. Companies are frustrated. Young people are frustrated. And looming over it all? AI, threatening to replace the few entry-level jobs Gen Z already struggles to land.Given this context, what's an \"unemployable\" (as one WSJ headline put it) Gen Zer supposed to do? Nobody wants to suppress their values, and that's understandable. But most people can't go without work. Is there a way forward for the 98% of Gen Zers who put self-care, authenticity, and altruism above company success and career propulsion?Here's my advice for the vast majority of Gen Zers stuck in what probably feels like a very untenable place.1. Come to terms with the value you place on wealthWhen I teach my class \"Becoming You\" at NYU Stern School of Business, I don't let students self-report when it comes to their desire for wealth. The reason is simple: People rarely tell the truth about their relationship with money — to themselves and others — because there's thought to be a faint stink off of wanting to be rich.But you cannot make any sustainable career decisions without getting very honest about the number in your head. That is, the amount of money you want and need to feel, \"That's enough.\" It could be \"one good vacation a year,\" as a student once put it, it could be as another admitted, \"one private helicopter per kid.\"My research shows that 42% of Gen Z has affluence in their top five values, 35% consider it a moderate value, and 23% have it in their bottom five values.Once you know where affluence ranks for you, you can make more thoughtful choices about whether to nudge yourself toward the 2% or not. After all, even with self-care as a top value, if wealth is close behind, something has to give. On the other hand, if wealth ranks No. 10 or even No. 16, a whole different world of work enters your realm of possibilities.2. Join or start a company that accommodates your valuesIf you do not want to suppress your values, your best strategy is to find a company that supports the ones you already have.Keep your eyes open for the published lists of businesses that are said to support employee wellbeing, authenticity, and giving back. Just know that these companies are often magnets for job-seekers. If you end up applying to one, make sure to level up with an excellent cover letter and top-notch resume.Then there's entrepreneurship. As a two-time founder myself, I know how grueling it can be. But if you have the right idea, with market fit and the stamina to match, creating your own workplace culture is the surest way to be able to live by your values.3. Make a decade-long deal with yourselfI rarely suggest people try to change their values. It's like changing your personality; it usually doesn't stick. But if landing a job is an urgent priority, and affluence is a long-range one, you may choose to suppress your desire for wellbeing, balance, and authentic self expression for a period of time and embrace achievement and workcentrism.In other words, make like the Boomers and say hello to delayed gratification.My word of warning, however, is if you follow this strategy, don't dabble and don't relitigate your decision daily. Instead, commit. And commit for long enough to see results. I recommend a full decade. Overnight success is a myth, even for those in the 2%.How much you live by your values is one of the most personal, consequential choices you'll ever make. That choice can shape your income, your sense of purpose, and the arc of your career. Approach it not with panic or resignation, but with the wisdom of your years — both the ones you've already lived and the many still ahead.Suzy Welch is an award-winning NYU Stern School of Business professor, acclaimed researcher, popular podcaster and three-time NYT best-selling author, most recently with \"Becoming You: A Proven Method for Crafting Your Authentic Life and Career.\" A graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Business School, Dr. Welch is a frequent guest of the Today Show and an op-ed contributor to the Wall Street Journal.

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, D.C., on March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market are a sign that corporate lending standards grew too lax in the past decade-plus.Dimon, the longtime leader of the largest U.S. bank by assets, was speaking about the recent collapse of auto parts firm First Brands and subprime car lender Tricolor Holdings.\"We've had a credit bull market now for the better part of what, since 2010 or 2012? That's like 14 years,\" Dimon told CNBC on a call with reporters.\"These are early signs there might be some excess out there because of it,\" Dimon said. \"If we ever have a downturn, you're going to see quite a bit more credit issues.\"Dimon used more colorful language about the Tricolor failure later Tuesday.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" Dimon told analyst Mike Mayo during the bank's earnings conference call. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"The pair of bankruptcies have sparked concerns about the hidden risks involved when banks like JPMorgan, Jefferies and Fifth Third provide financing for private companies. In a quarter where JPMorgan handily topped expectations, thanks to booming activity in institutional trading, questions from reporters and analysts around credit losses took center stage.'Not our finest moment'While JPMorgan managed to dodge losses from First Brands, it did lend to Tricolor, causing $170 million in charge-offs in the quarter, said CFO Jeremy Barnum. Charge-offs happen when a bank recognizes it won't get repaid for loans it made.\"It is not our finest moment,\" Dimon said of the Tricolor episode. \"When something like that happens, you could assume that we scour every issue. ... You can never completely avoid these things, but the discipline is to look at it in cold light and go through every single little thing.\"The credit metrics watched by JPMorgan, including early stage delinquencies, are stable and actually better than expected, Barnum said. The company is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness that could flow into consumer credit, which hasn't happened yet, he said.The automotive company failures, which came amid pressure on international supply chains due in part to President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, have ensnared a constellation of banks.This month, the investment bank Jefferies said that funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies that bought First Brand inventory, while UBS said that its funds had about $500 million in exposure.Last month, regional bank Fifth Third disclosed that it expected up to $200 million in impairments from alleged fraudulent activity at a borrower; the client was Tricolor, Bloomberg reported.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff participates in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, 2025.Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce is ramping up partnerships with leaders in generative artificial intelligence as investors continue to fear that the software company faces business risks due to the rapid growth of AI.Just ahead of its annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, Salesforce said Tuesday it will enable the use of AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic inside its Agentforce 360 software. A day earlier, Salesforce expanded Agentforce beyond text chats to also handle voice calls.\"The way people are going to interact with software is going to fundamentally shift,\" said Brian Landsman, CEO of Salesforce's AppExchange business and executive vice president of partnerships, in an interview. The interaction could be in ChatGPT or in Slack, he said.Salesforce will collaborate with Anthropic to bring Agentforce 360 into Claude, Landsman added.Shares of Salesforce are down about 26% this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 13%, as Wall Street seeks faster revenue growth from the cloud software company. So far, Agentforce revenue has been \"modest,\" Morgan Stanley analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Salesforce, wrote in a Monday note.Large software companies are increasingly turning to popular AI model developers for new capabilities. Atlassian, Datadog and Intuit have previously signed deals with OpenAI, and Microsoft has invested almost $14 billion in the company. In September, Databricks committed to spending $100 million on OpenAI models.As part of Salesforce's announcement, customers will be able to access corporate information in Agentforce 360 and create charts in Tableau through the ChatGPT assistant, which has more than 800 million weekly users. Last week OpenAI announced a software development kit for integrating third-party applications into ChatGPT.Companies working with both OpenAI and Salesforce will be able to sell products through ChatGPT's instant checkout feature later in 2025. Salesforce plans to work with Anthropic on selling products for regulated industries, starting with financial services.OpenAI said last month that ChatGPT users would be able to purchase products from U.S. Etsy sellers and Shopify merchants.Meanwhile, Salesforce said its engineering organization is adopting Anthropic's Claude Code programming product.\"We plan to continue to go much deeper with these partners over time,\" Landsman said.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has been defending his company's position in the AI boom. And on last month's earnings call, he said Anthropic and OpenAI both use Salesforce tools.\"All these next-generation AI companies ranging from OpenAI to Anthropic to everyone are on Slack,\" Benioff, who is also Salesforce's co-founder, told analysts. \"And it is incredible how they've used that as their operating system and as their platform to run their companies.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff goes one-on-one with Jim Cramerwatch now",

The speech comes two weeks ahead of the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting and is expected to be Powell's last remarks before then.In recent comments, Powell has stressed risks to both sides of the Fed's dual goals of full employment and low inflation. He has noted that unemployment is still low but job creation is running below the level that could keep the jobless rate steady. In addition, he has said inflation continues to run above the Fed's 2% target but likely will come down after getting a temporary boost from tariffs.Traders expect the Fed to cut at both its October and December meetings, with an uncertain path from there.Read more:Powell says slowing labor market prompted rate cut, sees 'challenging situation' aheadFed Chief Powell says stock prices appear 'fairly highly valued'Fed Governor Waller sees more rate cuts but says central bank needs to be 'cautious about it'The government shutdown is likely to cement additional Fed interest rate cutsSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube. ",

    "body": "LG Electronics India is seeking a valuation of up to 774 billion rupees ($8.71 billion) in its long-delayed initial public offering, tapping into a bustling IPO market with one of India's largest offerings so far this year.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesLG Electronics India's market cap surpassed that of its parent company after the subsidiary's shares surged over 45% on market debut Tuesday.The Indian unit's market cap stood at 1.14 trillion rupees ($12.83 billion) as of 11.15 a.m. local time (1.45 a.m. ET), while its parent company's valuation was 13.84 trillion Korean won ($9.68 billion).The company's shares surged as much as 50% on open, after its initial public offering saw the strongest demand for an Indian IPO since 2008, led by institutional investors. Shares were last trading 45% higher.The IPO was priced at the top end of the 1,080 rupee to 1,140 rupee apiece band, fetching 116 billion rupees ($1.3 billion), and was oversubscribed more than 54 times, attracting bids worth about 4.4 trillion rupees or nearly $50 billion, exchange data revealed.This was the most heavily subscribed major Indian IPO since Reliance Power's listing in 2008, PRIME Database's Pranav Haldea told CNBC. It saw massive demand from qualified institutional buyers, who bid 166 times their allotted portion. Retail investor portion was oversubscribed 3.55 times.The IPO was structured as an offer for sale — no new shares were issued — with parent LG Electronics selling 101.8 million shares. It was managed by a consortium of international and domestic bookrunners, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Axis Capital, BofA Securities, and Citigroup Global Markets India.Shares began trading Tuesday on the National Stock Exchange of India as well as the BSE.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tGet a weekly roundup of news from India in your inbox every Thursday.\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tThis is the second major South Korean company that has tapped Indian markets in about a year, after Hyundai Motor India's listing in October 2024.LG Electronics India is a unit of South Korea's LG Electronics. It designs, manufactures, and markets a wide range of consumer electronics and home appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, televisions, and smart home devices.\"LG Electronics India stands out as the listed appliance player with the widest offerings and are popular in most of the product categories they are present in,\" said Himanshu Dugar, a SEBI-registered independent equity research analyst.According to Redseer Strategy Consultants, India's electronics and appliances market is projected to almost double from about $75 billion in 2024 to roughly $130 billion to $150 billion by 2029. \"Accordingly, we expect LG Electronics India, as the market leader, will benefit from these tailwinds,\" said Dugar.India continues to rank among the world's busiest IPO markets this year. EY's latest global report shows the country logged 146 offerings in the third quarter, raising $7.2 billion. That brought the nine-month tally to 254 deals worth $11.8 billion, underscoring the depth of its domestic capital markets, with IPO returns standing at 17.5%.—CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Instagram has installed a new privacy setting which will default all new and existing underage accounts to an automatic private mode.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesMeta will now limit the content that teenage users can see on Instagram to what they would typically encounter in a movie rated PG-13, the social media company said Tuesday.With the new content guidelines, Meta said it will hide certain accounts from teenagers, including those that share sexualized content or media related to drugs and alcohol. Additionally, teenagers on Instagram will not be recommended posts that contain swear words, though teen users can still search for it.The changes come after the company has faced waves of criticism over its handling of child-safety and related mental health concerns on its platform.As part of the changes, Instagram accounts with names or biographies with links to adult-themed websites like OnlyFans or liquor stores will be hidden from teens, the company said. Teen Instagram users will no longer able to follow those kinds of accounts, and if they already do, they will be unable to see or interact with the more adult-leaning content that they share.Meta executives said during a media briefing that while the company's previous content guidelines were already in line or exceeded PG-13 standards, some parents said they were confused about what kinds of content teens could view on Instagram. To provide clarity, Meta decided to more closely standardize its teen-content policies with movie ratings that parents could better understand, the executives said.\"We decided to more closely align our policies with an independent standard that parents are familiar with, so we reviewed our age-appropriate guidelines against PG-13 movie ratings and updated them accordingly,\" the company said in a blog post. \"While of course there are differences between movies and social media, we made these changes so teens' experience in the 13+ setting feels closer to the Instagram equivalent of watching a PG-13 movie.\"The social media company has come under fire from lawmakers who claim that it fails to adequately police its platform for child-safety related issues.The company then known as Facebook came under fire in 2021 when The Wall Street Journal published a report citing internal company research that showed how harmful Instagram was for teenage girls specifically. Other reports have also shown how easily teenagers can use Instagram to find drugs, including through ads run by the company.Over the past year, Meta has rolled out several features intended to provide parents more transparency about how their teenagers are using the company's apps. In July, Meta debuted new safety tools intended to make it easier for teenage Instagram users to block and report accounts as well as receive more information about who they interact with on the platform. In August, the watchdog Tech Transparency Project released a report that alleged Meta's ties and sponsorship of the National Parent Teacher Association \"gives a sheen of expert approval\" to its \"efforts to keep young users engaged on its platforms.\" The National PTA said in a statement that it doesn't endorse any social media platform, while Meta said at the time that it is \"proud to partner with expert organizations to educate parents about our safety tools and protections for teens, as many other tech companies do.\"Meta said its new Instagram content guidelines will begin rolling out Tuesday in the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada before expanding to other regions.WATCH: Is an AI Bubble Brewing?watch now",

    "body": "Governor Gavin Newsom speaks at Google San Francisco office about 'Creating an AI-Ready Workforce' that new joint effort with some of the world's leading tech companies to help better prepare California's students and workers for the next generation of technology, in San Francisco, California, United States on August 7, 2025. Tayfun Coskun | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills Monday targeting child online safety as concerns over the risks associated with artificial intelligence and social media use keep mounting.\"We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly — protecting our children every step of the way,\" he said in a release. \"Our children’s safety is not for sale.”The latest legislation comes as the AI craze ushers in a wave of more complex chatbots capable of deep, intellectual conversation and encouraging behaviors. Across age groups, people are leaning on AI for emotional support, companionship and in some cases, romantic connections.A recent survey from Fractl Agents found that one in six Americans rely on chatbots and worry that losing access would stunt them emotionally and professionally. More than a fifth of respondents reported having an emotional connection with their chatbot.Many lawmakers have called for laws requiring Big Tech to better protect against chatbots promoting unsafe behaviors such as suicide and self-harm on their platforms.The bills signed into law by Newsom on Monday are intended to address some of those concerns.The changesOne of the laws passed by California implements a series of safeguards geared toward AI chatbots.SB 243 is the first state law of its kind and requires chatbots to disclose that they are AI and tell minors every three hours to \"take a break.\" Chatbots makers will also need to implement tools to protect against harmful behaviors and disclose certain instances to a crisis hotline.The law allows California to maintain its lead in innovation while also holding companies accountable and prioritizing safety, Newsom said in a release.In a statement to CNBC, OpenAI called the law a \"meaningful move forward\" for AI safety standards.\"By setting clear guardrails, California is helping shape a more responsible approach to AI development and deployment across the country,\" the company said.Another bill signed by Newsom, AB 56, requires that social media platforms including Instagram and Snapchat to add labels that warn users of the potential mental health risks associated with using those types of apps. AB 621, meanwhile, heighten penalties for companies whose platforms distribute deepfake pornography.The other key law, known as AB 1043, requires that device makers, like Apple and Google, implement tools to verify user ages in their app stores. Some Big Tech companies have already endorsed the law's safeguards, including Google and Meta.Last month, Kareem Ghanem, Google's senior director of government and affairs and public policy, called AB 1043 one of the \"most thoughtful approaches\" to keeping children safe online.The impact to big techThe new laws require a series of changes to many long-standing business models. But D.A. Davidson's Gil Luria said companies should experience a \"distributed\" impact from these new measures, since all businesses are forced to accommodate the rules.\"For AI chats the timing is beneficial since these companies are still working out their business models and will now accommodate a more restrictive approach at the outset,\" he said.Other countries have already enacted rules tougher restrictions on AI. Last year, the European Union passed the AI Act that includes fines for companies that violate the laws' framework that includes a social scoring systems.Utah and Texas have also signed laws implementing AI safeguards for minors. The Utah law, for example, requires that Apple and Google to verify user ages and it requires parental permission for those under 18 to use certain apps. These laws have also raised questions over whether harsh restrictions violate free speech or bans are the most effective solution.California isn't the first jurisdiction to pass laws like these, but Newsom's signings carry significance due to the size of the state's population and the fact that many tech companies are based in the San Francisco Bay Area.WATCH: Why it's time to take AI-human relationships seriouslywatch now",

    "body": "2026 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepDETROIT – Jeep is overhauling its top-end Grand Wagoneer lineup for the 2026 model year under a yearslong turnaround plan for the quintessential American SUV brand.The changes include updating exterior styling, introducing a new forthcoming extended-range powertrain and creating a simplified, less expensive model lineup all under the \"Grand Wagoneer\" name. Jeep will also kill off the standalone \"Wagoneer\" nameplate.\"This marks a significant portfolio moment in refining our flagship SUV to reach a broader audience,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said during a media event.Since launching in 2021, the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer have not lived up to expectations. Initial production of the vehicles was riddled with problems and the dual nameplates for the same-looking vehicles confused consumers.2022 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepThe initial pricing for those vehicles also could top $111,000 — which had been unexplored territory for the brand known for rugged SUVs — and they featured a host of tiered trim levels that complicated ordering.\"We confused our buyers. We confused our dealers,\" Broderdorf said. \"I'm here to tell you we got the message. We're fixing it.\"The 2026 Grand Wagoneer will start under $65,000, including mandatory destination charges. That is similar to where the Wagoneer currently starts in pricing, but Jeep said it includes additional features and is more in line with competitors' pricing.\"I'm here to win,\" Broderdorf said. \"I want to come out very, very fast and see what we can do to really gain some share and continue to grow the brand … that was the mission for me.\"2026 Jeep Grand Wagoneer JeepJeep, owned by French-Italian-American automaker Stellantis, said it expects to the Grand Wagoneer to be the first SUV with a plug-in technology known as a range-extender, or EREV. It can operate as a zero-emissions EV until its battery dies and an electric onboard generator — powered by a 27-gallon, 3.6-liter V6 engine — kicks on to power the vehicle.Stellantis' Ram Trucks brand was expected to be the first to launch an EREV model, but after several delays and the brand conducting its own turnaround plan, the Jeep model is expected to be the first EREV available beginning next year.Jeep is one of the most crucial of Stellantis' 14 brands — if not the most important in North America. The revamped Grand Wagoneer is the second of four major product announcements that began this summer with the reveal of its new Jeep Cherokee SUV.The turnaround plan also has included reworking pricing of Jeep SUVs, which inflated in recent years above market norms, and re-engaging with its alienated dealer network amid a lack of new products and declining sales.So far, Jeep's U.S. sales are moving in the right direction. The brand is on track to report its first year-over-year sales gain since 2018, when it recorded all-time high sales of more than 973,000 vehicles. That compares to 587,725 units sold last year, a 40% drop from Jeep's sales peak.\"Quite frankly, my only interest is growing this brand and doing so in a very fun, historical Jeep way,\" said Broderdorf, who succeeded now-Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa in leading Jeep in February.",

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025.Eric Lee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe thousands of federal workers newly laid off by the Trump administration face numerous financial challenges, including finding new health insurance and keeping up with recurring bills. Another key task: Figuring out what to do about their monthly student loan payment.The permanent job cuts — which Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, announced on Friday — are formally known as \"Reductions in Force,\" or RIFs. The RIFs will strip many federal workers of certain benefits related to their student loans and make it harder for them to repay their debt.However, there are options available that allow borrowers to pause their payments or request a lower payment during difficult times.Here's what federal workers should know about their student loan options.How RIFs affect repayment assistance, forgivenessOften, federal agencies provide their employees with student loan repayment assistance of up to $10,000 per year, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. In total, federal workers can get up to $60,000 under the U.S. Office of Personnel Management program.In 2024, more than 16,500 federal employees collectively received around $150 million in student loan repayment benefits, according to an OPM report.\"This is one of the key perks that help attract recent college graduates to working for the federal government,\" Kantrowitz said. \"But, when a borrower's employment is terminated, they lose this benefit.\"Federal workers should not need to repay any benefits they've received before the RIF, he added.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhat laid off federal workers need to know about their student loansDespite government shutdown, Oct. 15 is still the tax extension deadlineBoomers still love their department stores.

PSLF offers loan forgiveness to certain public servants after a decade.Borrowers will retain credit for qualifying PSLF payments they made before the RIF.Try getting a lower monthly paymentFederal student loan borrowers who are laid off from their jobs are usually able to sign up for an income-driven repayment plan and get a lower payment, or even a $0 bill. IDR plans limit borrowers' monthly payments to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.While IDR plan applications may be delayed during the government shutdown, you should be placed in a temporary forbearance after you submit your request, Kantrowitz said. You won't need to make a payment for that period, but interest may continue to accrue on your debt.watch nowAny unemployment benefits you collect will count as income in the U.S. Department of Education's calculation of your monthly bill. Even so, those payments often come out to far less than what a person was earning while employed, according to a 2023 report from the National Employment Law Project.One important thing to note: The government may calculate your monthly payment obligation under an IDR plan based on your last filed tax return, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.But if your earnings have dropped recently, \"you can provide proof of your current income instead,\" Nierman said.Borrowers who were caught in a RIF may also be eligible for an Unemployment Deferment. Under that option, the Education Department often allows you to pause your payments if you're receiving unemployment benefits or looking for and unable to find full-time employment, among other requirements. (Some student loans will still accrue interest during the payment pause, while others will not.)Recent legislation will do away with the Unemployment Deferment for those who take out student loans after July 1, 2027. But current borrowers will maintain access to the relief option.",

    "body": "At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. \"There's some trickery happening,\" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. \"Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.\"That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. \"The consumer has to be proactive,\" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. \"Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale.\" Track price historiesIdeally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, \"it's definitely not too late\" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. \"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,\" says Woroch. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. \"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,\" Woroch says. \"Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.\"Beware of other Black Friday pitfallsAlthough Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. \"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,\" says Lupo. \"But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.\"And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls \"spaving\" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive \"bundle\" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. \"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,\" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, \"you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "The Workday Inc. pop-up pavilion ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2025.Hollie Adams | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of software maker Workday slid nearly 8% on Wednesday as analysts lowered their price targets, citing a lack of a upside after the company revised its full-year subscription revenue forecast.Many software stocks have been under pressure in 2025 as commentators have worried that generative artificial intelligence tools that can quickly write lines of code might pose risks to incumbents. This year, Workday has announced the launch of several AI agents and expanded its offerings through startup acquisitions. Earlier this month, Workday completed the $1.1 billion purchase of AI and learning software company Sana.Despite those moves, Workday's third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress Wall Street. The company called for $8.83 billion in subscription revenue for the fiscal year that will end in January 2026, implying 14.4% growth, but the figure was up just $13 million from the company's guidance in August. The new number includes contributions from Sana and a contract with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Workday finance chief Zane Rowe told analysts on a conference call.\"Investors were likely looking for more of a beat-and-raise quarter,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Matt VanVliet and Mason Marion wrote in a note to clients. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday stock. The new number, they wrote, \"borders on a slight guide down.\" The analysts held their 12-month price target on Workday stock at $280.Stifel, with a hold rating on the stock, lowered its Workday target to $235 from $255.\"It does not appear that the underlying momentum of the business is showing any signs of stabilization,\" Stifel's Brad Reback and Robert Galvin wrote in a note. Reback and Galvin said Workday implied that growth from its 12-month subscription revenue backlog will continue to slow when removing impact from acquisitions. They expect the trend to continue even as customers sign up for Workday's AI products, they wrote.The outcome was \"like turkey without the gravy,\" Evercore analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, wrote in the title of their note. Analysts at RBC, which also has the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday shares, lowered their price target to $320 from $340. Despite the mixed guidance, they wrote in a note to clients, results for the fiscal third quarter did exceed consensus. Plus, AI products contributed over 1.5 percentage points of annualized revenue growth, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on Tuesday's conference call. '\"We remain encouraged by early AI momentum,\" the RBC analysts wrote.WATCH: AI will drive the market higher in 2026, says Citizens' Mark Lehmannwatch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump returns to the White House on Marine One in Washington, D.C., on November 22, 2025.Allison Robbert | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesA judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case \"dismissed in its entirety,\" draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"\"In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years,\" Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.Fulton County Sheriff's OfficeTrump celebrated the ruling later Wednesday, writing in a lengthy Truth Social post that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed.\"\"This case should never have been brought,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement. \"A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"The case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v. Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.Alex Slitz-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.By that time, Willis was facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was disqualified from the case in December 2024.The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on November 19, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesNvidia on Tuesday said its tech remains a generation ahead of the industry, in response to Wall Street's concerns that the company's dominance of AI infrastructure could be threatened by Google's AI chips.\"We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,\" Nvidia said in a post on X. \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"The post came after Nvidia saw its shares fall 3% on Tuesday after a report that Meta, one of its key customers, could strike a deal with Google to use its tensor processing units for its data centers. In its post, Nvidia said its chips are more flexible and powerful compared with so-called ASIC chips — such as Google's TPUs — which are designed for a single company or function. Nvidia's latest generation of chips are known as Blackwell. \"NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,\" Nvidia said in its post. Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for artificial intelligence chips with its graphics processors, analysts say, but Google's in-house chips have gotten increased attention in recent weeks as a viable alternative to the Blackwell chips, which are expensive but powerful. Unlike Nvidia, Google doesn't sell its TPU chips to other companies, but it uses them for internal tasks and allows companies to rent them through Google Cloud. Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 3, a well-reviewed state-of-the-art AI model that was trained on the company's TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. \"We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed rising TPU competition on an earnings call earlier this month, noting that Google was a customer for his company's GPU chips and that Gemini can run on Nvidia's technology. He also mentioned that he was in touch with Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Huang said that Hassabis texted him to say that the tech industry theory that using more chips and data will create more powerful AI models — often called \"scaling laws\" by AI developers — is \"intact.\" Nvidia says that scaling laws will lead to even more demand for the company's chips and systems.

    "body": "It's been a tough job market for young professionals, but there's some good news for 2026: New grads with up to four years' work experience are expected to see stronger wage growth next year, according to Glassdoor research.In other words, early-career workers who can secure a job are likely to have more spending power, at a rate surpassing 2020 levels — the last time wage growth kept pace with inflation.Wage growth will vary depending on the location. While rising cities may not offer the biggest paychecks compared to places like New York or San Francisco, they're seeing the fastest wage growth and offer a lower cost of living, Glassdoor researchers note.These are the top 10 cities for early-career wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor research:1. Provo, UtahAnnual growth since 2020: 7.0%Average salary in 2025: $61,164Job groups with fastest wage growth: Research and science; product and project management; human resources2. Boise, IdahoAnnual growth since 2020: 5.5%Average salary in 2025: $60,876Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; skilled labor and manufacturing; business3.

Tucson, ArizonaAnnual growth since 2020: 5.1%Average salary in 2025: $59,975Job groups with fastest wage growth: Engineering; health care; retail and food servicesHealth-care jobs are the most in-demand roles with rising pay for young workers, Glassdoor lead researcher Chris Martin told CNBC Make It via email. These positions led wage growth in three of the top 10 cities: Boise, Charleston and Rochester.GlassdoorOverall, health care along with private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time. They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025, according to an Indeed analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Meanwhile, customer services and support roles led wage growth in Miami and Austin, per Glassdoor.And in many cities, wages are rising for jobs across the income spectrum, according to Glassdoor data. For example, Tucson's fastest-growing salaries for young workers were for engineering roles that pay an average salary of $86,700 in 2025, followed by health care ($64,100) and then retail and food services jobs ($35,800).Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore has claimed the top position in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) for the first time, bolstered by its robust education systems, sound governance and a proactive approach to sustaining an adaptive, innovation-ready workforce in the age of artificial intelligence.In its 11th edition this year, the index — produced by business school INSEAD and in partnership with D.C.-based think tank Portulans Institute — measured how countries grow, attract and retain talent across all income groups.This year's report, themed \"resilience in the age of disruption,\" ranked 135 economies globally on 77 indicators such as soft skills and AI talent concentration across six pillars.This report comes at a time when \"rapid technological change, geopolitical uncertainty and profound societal transitions make dependable talent metrics more essential than ever,\" said Rafael Escalona Reynoso, CEO of Portulans Institute.While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety.Lily FangDean of research and innovation, INSEAD\"While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety,\" said INSEAD's dean of research and innovation, Lily Fang. \"Geopolitical uncertainty poses massive challenges to the resilience of global commerce and markets, while artificial intelligence presents both amazing opportunities to enhance human potential — but also unfathomable risks.\"Here are the top 10 countries in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index: SingaporeSwitzerlandDenmarkFinlandSwedenNetherlandsNorwayLuxembourgUnited StatesAustralia Notably, Switzerland was leapfrogged by Singapore and fell from its top position for the first time in the history of the GTCI. However, the country records multiple top-five results across the study's framework, including internet access in schools (1st), government effectiveness (2nd), and AI skills migration (4th).High-income European countries continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for seven of the top ten positions. Switzerland, Denmark and Finland closely follow each other in the top ten, \"suggesting a shared focus on enabling and retaining talent through favorable conditions and access to opportunities,\" according to the report. These three countries consistently rank near the top in enabling and retaining talent.Several Nordic countries have jumped places in the top ten since the last GTCI in 2023. Denmark moved up one position to 3rd this year from 4th in the 2023 report, Finland jumped two places from 6th to 4th, and Sweden jumped four places from 9th in rank in 2023 to 4th this year. Meanwhile, the United States fell from third place in 2023 to ninth in this year's report — its weakest showing since 2013. Although the U.S. scored strongly in areas such as enabling and growing talent, \"slight declines in the categories of openness and lifelong learning\" pushed the country down to ninth place in 2025, according to the report.Singapore takes the leadSingapore's rise marks a big milestone for both the country and the wider region in the competition for talent, the report said.The city-state \"ranks in the top ten across four of the six pillars and has made notable improvements in its ability to retain talent, rising seven positions,\" according to the report. The Southeast Asian country also leads globally in enabling and retaining talent, which is supported by the country's regulatory landscape and high standards of living. The country also ranked first globally in formal education and \"Generalist Adaptive Skills,\" which spans soft skills, digital literacy, and innovation-oriented thinking.A key driver of Singapore's jump this year is a sharp improvement in its ability to retain talent, jumping seven places from 38th in 2023 to 31st this year. The report pointed to gains in areas such as physician density, personal rights, personal safety and more. \"Economies that cultivate adaptable, cross-functional and AI-literate workforces tend to be better positioned to convert disruption into opportunity and sustain long-term competitiveness,\" says Paul Evans, emeritus professor of organisational behaviour at INSEAD and co-editor of the report.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act.The IRA, voted into law in 2022, allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate prices for a number of drugs each year for patients in Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. While these changes are taking place firmly in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies across the globe are finding themselves increasingly exposed to the American market. A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes.Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price.Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending.watch now\"Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like,\" said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. \"We strongly believe in the value of both Trelegy and Breo and remain committed to working with CMS.\"Novo, on the other hand, was critical. \"We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting,\" a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. \"We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums,\" they added.A key marketThe U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. In the first nine months of 2025, 56% of Novo's total sales originated in the U.S. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca logged 42% of product sales in the U.S. and GSK some 52%, over the same period.Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found.\"The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting,\" Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. \"It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all,\" she added. Muted shares also indicated that the outcome of the negotiations was largely expected. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. Novo shares however, ended the day 4.7% higher. Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, will from 2027 be priced at $274 for Medicare patients, down from a previous list price of $959. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. CMS is due to publish its list of 15 drugs selected for negotiations for 2028 by February 1, 2026.A Trump priorityThe IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. \"What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different,\" she said. Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo, AstraZeneca and GSK shares year to date.Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years.While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices. ",

    "body": "Amazon's new MK30 Prime Air drone is displayed during Amazon's \"Delivering the Future\" event at the company's BFI1 Fulfillment Center, Robotics Research and Development Hub in Sumner, Washington on Oct. 18, 2023.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAmazon is facing a federal probe after one of its delivery drones downed an internet cable in central Texas last week. The probe comes as Amazon vies to expand drone deliveries to more pockets of the U.S., more than a decade after it first conceived the aerial distribution program, and faces stiffer competition from Walmart, which has also begun drone deliveries. The incident occurred on Nov. 18 around 12:45 p.m. Central in Waco, Texas. After dropping off a package, one of Amazon's MK30 drones was ascending out of a customer's yard when one of its six propellers got tangled in a nearby internet cable, according to a video of the incident viewed and verified by CNBC. The video shows the Amazon drone shearing the wire line. The drone's motor then appeared to shut off and the aircraft landed itself, with its propellers windmilling slightly on the way down, the video shows. The drone appeared to remain in tact beyond some damage to one of its propellers. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, a spokesperson confirmed. The National Transportation Safety Board said the agency is aware of the incident but has not opened a probe into the matter. Amazon confirmed the incident to CNBC, saying that after clipping the internet cable, the drone performed a \"safe contingent landing,\" referring to the process that allows its drones to land safely in unexpected conditions.\"There were no injuries or widespread internet service outages. We've paid for the cable line's repair for the customer and have apologized for the inconvenience this caused them,\" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, noting that the drone had completed its package delivery.watch nowThe incident comes after federal investigators last month opened a separate probe into a crash involving two of Amazon's Prime Air drones in Arizona. The two aircrafts collided with a construction crane in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, prompting Amazon to temporarily halt drone deliveries in the area.For over a decade, Amazon has been working to realize founder Jeff Bezos' vision of drones whizzing toothpaste, books and other goods to customers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less. The company began drone deliveries in 2022 in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California.But progress has been slowed by a mix of regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and layoffs in 2023 that coincided with broader cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The company has previously said its goal is to deliver 500 million packages by drone per year by the end of the decade. The hexacopter-shaped MK30, the latest generation of Amazon's Prime Air drone, is meant to be quieter, smaller and lighter than previous versions. Amazon says the drones are equipped with a sense-and-avoid system that enables them to \"detect and stay away from obstacles in the air and on the ground.\" The company recommends that customers maintain \"about 10 feet of open space\" on their property so drones can complete deliveriesThe company began drone deliveries in Waco earlier this month for customers within a certain radius of its same-day delivery site who order eligible items weighing 5 pounds or less. The drone deliveries are supposed to drop packages off in under an hour. Amazon has brought other locations online in recent months, including Kansas City, Missouri, Pontiac, Michigan, San Antonio, Texas, and Ruskin, Florida. Amazon has also announced plans to expand drone deliveries to Richardson, Texas. Walmart began offering drone deliveries in 2021, and currently partners with Alphabet's Wing and venture-backed startup Zipline to make drone deliveries in a number of states, including in Texas.WATCH: Amazon unveils satellite terminal for enterprise customers — but Starlink still dominateswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowMassachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.\"Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,\" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.watch nowTennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. \"One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,\" she said. Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. \"Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,\" the report says. Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. \"It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,\" Salvador said.

Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters Wednesday that \"the content [of the U.S. plan] will be discussed,\" at the meeting, and claimed Russian officials had not discussed a U.S.-backed plan when talks were held with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. \"We, the Russian side, have not yet discussed any documents with anyone specifically ... We've agreed to a meeting with Mr. Witkoff. I hope he won't be alone. Other representatives of the U.S. team working on the Ukrainian dossier will be there,\" he said in comments translated by NBC News and reported by state news agency TASS. Ushakov said Russia had not yet officially received the U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine but had seen an unofficial version. Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" in comments reported by Reuters on Wednesday.Earlier today, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentatively Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.Reports from ABC News and CBS News both cited an unnamed U.S. official who said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while noting that some points still need to be ironed out. It was not clear if the same U.S. official was quoted in both stories.watch nowUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"Flurry of talksTrump's post came several days after U.S. officials met with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva last weekend for talks that resulted in significant revisions to Washington's initially proffered 28-point peace plan.That plan — which was widely seen as being highly favorable to Russia, the invading force — \"has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides,\" Trump acknowledged in Tuesday's post.\"Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,\" Ukraine National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov said in an X post.It's far from certain the Russia will assent to the revised peace plan, which has reportedly been narrowed to 19 points.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said any agreement must reflect the understandings reached by Trump and Putin during their August summit in Alaska.On Tuesday, officials from Kyiv and Moscow reportedly met with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place there, with Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Tuesday that \"we still have nothing to say\" and that the Kremlin was \"monitoring media reports.\"Read more\"We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information,\" Peskov said. \"For now, we have no new information.\"The initial, 28-point plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces.The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"Trump had pushed Ukraine to accept that deal by the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 27, prompting Zelenskyy to declare on Friday that Ukraine faced the difficult choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.That deadline appears to have been scrapped. It was unclear how many of the original deal's points remained in the latest version of a potential peace agreement.",

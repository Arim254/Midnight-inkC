    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingIf it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them prove to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "A Waymo car is halted on the road amid a power outage in San Francisco, California, U.S., December 20, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video.dReutersThree days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service, the Alphabet-owned company said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages. \"We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails,\" the company said in a blog post late Tuesday. Power outages began early afternoon on Saturday in San Francisco and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power. PG&E said a fire at a substation resulted in \"significant and   extensive\" damage.With stoplights and traffic signals not functioning, the city was hit with widespread gridlock. Videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in various neighborhoods. \"We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves,\" Waymo said in Tuesday's blog post. \"This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.\"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in an update on X Saturday evening that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo said that it's analyzing the event, and is taking three \"immediate steps.\" The first involves \"fleet-wide updates\" to give vehicles \"more context about regional outages,\" so cars can take more decisive actions at intersections. The company said it's also improving its \"emergency response protocols,\" and is coordinating with Mayor Lurie's team in San Francisco to better collaborate in emergency preparedness. Finally, Waymo said it's updating its first responder training \"as we discover learnings from this and other widespread events.\" In addition to the Bay Area, Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in and around Austin, Texas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company recently crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and said in December it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.\"Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors,\" the company said in Tuesday's blog.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "People gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a rare blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting his bid to overrule a lower court order and allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of local and state leaders.The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in October after a District Court judge blocked the president's plans to send troops to aid in an immigration crackdown. The court on Tuesday declined Trump's request.\"Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a post on X.\"This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump's march toward authoritarianism,\" Pritzker continued.U.S. presidents can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, but guardsmen are typically not permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. Trump's attempts to send troops to mostly blue cities to fight crime have tested the bounds of presidential authority and led to a series of lawsuits. Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by the Constitution or Congress, the court found Trump lacked the authority to deploy troops to Illinois in this case.\"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,\" the unsigned order states.The order is not final, but for now bars the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch offered dissenting opinions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion.Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Portland in recent months, despite objections from local leaders. Those deployments have resulted in several lawsuits, including a legal challenge from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and Trump foil, and local officials in D.C.\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday.\"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" Jackson continued. \"Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "watch nowU.S. shoppers are willing to spend this holiday season — despite falling consumer confidence and anxiety over prices — but only if the deals are there, Tanger CEO Stephen Yalof told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Retailers are discounting to meet the consumer, and the consumer is responding by shopping,\" Yalof said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" Yalof said Tanger tries to offer shoppers access to premium brands at prices that feel consistently compelling. Retailers across the company's outlet portfolio leaned heavily into promotions during the holidays, helping sustain traffic and sales.Customers are \"looking to come into a space where they can buy products at full price, maybe above the price point they want to spend, but they can embrace that price point because they know it's value priced every day,\" Yalof said.He described holiday traffic at Tanger's outlet centers as strong, citing full parking lots and steady activity through November and December.\"I feel like the customer is very resilient,\" he said. \"They're looking to spend.\"Yalof's comments come on the heels of fresh data showing that consumers are spending more than their confidence levels might suggest.U.S. retail spending rose 4.2% year over year during the holiday season, before adjusting for inflation, according to preliminary data from Visa released Tuesday. The report, which tracks payments activity beginning Nov. 1, found that in-store shopping accounted for 73% of spending, while online sales drove growth, rising 7.8% from a year earlier.At the same time, sentiment remains subdued. Consumer confidence weakened in December as Americans grew more anxious about persistently high prices and the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1, down from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November and nearing the 85.7 level seen in April, when the administration rolled out broad import duties on U.S. trading partners.Likewise, the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, released last week, found that 41% of Americans planned to spend less this holiday season, up 6 points from a year ago, as higher prices continued to shape where and how shoppers spend. Looking ahead, Yalof said retailers appear confident about demand in 2026.\"Retailers want stores. They love bricks and mortar,\" Yalof said, adding that brands are increasingly looking to control their own physical retail presence as department stores continue to consolidate.",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Warren Buffett is going into his last week as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle he has used to generate incredible wealth for himself, and for the company's loyal longtime shareholders, over the past six decades.Since he took control in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile company into a massive conglomerate worth more than $1 trillion.His Class A shares account for almost all of his estimated total net worth of $151 billion, which puts him in the #10 slot of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.He would be No. 22 on that list with roughly $359 billion if he held onto the hundreds of thousands of Berkshire B shares, currently valued at $208 billion, that he's been giving away since 2006, with more donations to come.Given all the success he's had with the company, it may be surprising to hear him call Berkshire \"the dumbest stock I ever bought\" ... a blunder that has cost him hundreds of billions of dollars.From the deep recesses of CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive, here's a rare clip of Buffett in 2010 with an in-depth explanation for Becky Quick of why he never should have bought Berkshire Hathaway and the important lesson he learned from his costly mistake.BECKY QUICK: All right.  Warren, thank you very much for joining us today.WARREN BUFFETT: My pleasure.BECKY QUICK: What we're trying to get to the bottom of is what was the worst trade you ever made and what'd you learn from it?WARREN BUFFETT: The dumbest thing I ever did?  (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: Yeah, the dumbest thing you ever did.WARREN BUFFETT: The — the dumbest stock I ever bought — was — drum roll here — Berkshire Hathaway. And — that may require a bit of explanation.  It was early in — 1962, and I was running a small partnership, about seven million. They'd call it a hedge fund now.And here was this cheap stock, cheap by working capital standards or so. But it was a stock in a — in a textile company that had been going downhill for years. So, it was a huge company originally, and they kept closing one mill after another. And every time they would close a mill, they would — take the proceeds and they would buy in their stock. And I figured they were going to close; they only had a few mills left, but that they would close another one. I'd buy the stock. I'd tender it to them and make a small profit.So I started buying the stock. And in 1964, we had quite a bit of stock. And I went back and visited the management, Mr. (Seabury) Stanton. And he looked at me and he said, 'Mr. Buffett. We've just sold some mills. We got some excess money. We're going to have a tender offer. And at what price will you tender your stock?'And I said, '11.50.' And he said, 'Do you promise me that you'll tender at 11.50?' And I said, 'Mr. Stanton, you have my word that if you do it here in the near future, that I will sell my stock to — at 11.50.' I went back to Omaha. And a few weeks later, I opened the mail —BECKY QUICK: Oh, you have this?WARREN BUFFETT: And here it is: a tender offer from Berkshire Hathaway — that's from 1964. And if you look carefully, you'll see the price is —BECKY QUICK: 11 and —WARREN BUFFETT:  — 11 and three-eighths. He chiseled me for an eighth. And if that letter had come through with 11 and a half, I would have tendered my stock. But this made me mad. So I went out and started buying the stock, and I bought control of the company, and fired Mr. Stanton. (LAUGHTER)And we went on from there.Now, that sounds like a great little morality table — tale at this point. But the truth is I had now committed a major amount of money to a terrible business. And Berkshire Hathaway became the base for everything pretty much that I've done since. So in 1967, when a good insurance company came along, I bought it for Berkshire Hathaway. I really should — should have bought it for a new entity.Because Berkshire Hathaway was carrying this anchor, all these textile assets. So initially, it was all textile assets that weren't any good. And then, gradually, we built more things on to it. But always, we were carrying this anchor. And for 20 years, I fought the textile business before I gave up. As instead of putting that money into the textile business originally, we just started out with the insurance company, Berkshire would be worth twice as much as it is now.  So —BECKY QUICK: Twice as much?WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. This is $200 billion. You can — you can figure that — comes about. Because the genius here thought he could run a textile business. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: Why $200 billion?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, because if you look at taking that same money that I put into the textile business and just putting it into the insurance business, and starting from there, we would have had a company that — because all of this money was a drag. I mean, we had to — a net worth of $20 million. And Berkshire Hathaway was earning nothing, year after year after year after year. And — so there you have it, the story of — a $200 billion —Incidentally, if you come back in ten years, I may have one that's even worse. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: If you — if you had to look at a moral for that story, though, is it don't cut off your nose to spite your face?WARREN BUFFETT: I would say — I would say that no matter whether you cut off your nose to spite your face or whatever, if you get in a lousy business, get out of it. I mean, it — it was — it was a terrible mistake, just because I drifted into it, in a sense. And — and I've always said that if you want to be known as a good manager, buy a good business. (LAUGHTER)That's the way to do it. And everyone will think you're smart.And when I'm in a good business, like people think, 'Boy that guy's smart.' And when I'm in a dumb business, like textiles, and don't know what I'm doing, you know, or shoes later on, or whatever it may be, you know, all that other — if you think you're a managerial genius, just try yourself in a bad business.BECKY QUICK: Is that the lesson that you learned from it?WARREN BUFFETT: Sure.BECKY QUICK: But — and that is something that you've actually put into practice?WARREN BUFFETT: I've actually put a line in my annual report many, many, many decades late — ago, after doing this. And I said, 'When a manager with a reputation for brilliance, meets up with a business with a reputation for bad economics, it's the reputation of the business that remains intact.'BECKY QUICK: (LAUGHTER) So that is a lesson you carried with you? And yet, it's one that is — you're reminded of every single day. It's Berkshire Hathaway.WARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. And every now and then, I get tempted. Because I started out with Ben Graham in 1950 or so. And his whole idea was buying things that were cheap.You don't want to buy things that are cheap. You want to buy things that are good. It's much better to buy something that's good at a fair price, than something that is cheap at a bargain price.And I wasn't — I didn't start out that way.  I — I was taught a different system. But — but if I didn't learn from Berkshire Hathaway, I'll never learn. (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: How long did it take you to figure out this lesson? You said it was —WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it took me 20 years to give up on the textile business. I — I had a wonderful guy running it after — after Seabury Stanton — a fellow named Ken Chase ran it. And he was terrific. Honest and able, hardworking. And he couldn't make it go.But we just kept working at it, trying — we bought another textile company called Waumbec Mills in Manchester, New Hampshire. Another mistake.If you're going to be brilliant with a lousy business, why not be brilliant with a good business?BECKY QUICK: But really, how — it took 20 years for you to finally give up on it. When did you kind of figure, oh, this is not working? Was it — did it — was it really 20 years? Or did you kind of know —WARREN BUFFETT: Well, it was — no. I figured it out fairly soon. But I just kept thinking I'm not going to give up on this. And incidentally, we had a work force that was terrific. I mean, it — it was — we weren't done in by anything except competitive dynamics. And I — we'd buy new equipment, or we would move — we would add this mill in Manchester, and we'd say, 'Look at all those synergies,' and all that. Nothing works.I — In fact, I used to have a desk in my drawer. And they would keep sending me these things that if we buy this machine, we'll save 14 people. If we buy this machine, we'll save 12 people. I kept putting it in my drawer. With all those machines, we'd save more people than we had at the start of the — supposedly, we were operating with zero people. But it doesn't work that way.BECKY QUICK: Is there any business that you didn't get into because you thought, wait a second, I've been down this road before? Where you were tempted and you kind of pulled back?WARREN BUFFETT: I get calls on them every day. You know, I mean, I get calls — not every day. I mean, it's an exaggeration. But I get calls frequently on businesses that are just too tough. And — and people say, you know, why don't you tackle it? You know, got all these resources now and good managers.But the interesting thing about business, it's not like the Olympics. In the Olympics, you know, if you do some dive off the — on a high board and have four or five twists — (LAUGHTER) on the way down, and you go in the water a little bad, there's a degree of difficulty factor. So you'll get more points than some guy that just does a little headfirst dive in perfectly.So degree of difficulty counts in the Olympics. It doesn't count in business.  Now, you don't get any extra points for the fact that something's very hard to do. So you might as well just step over one-foot bars instead of trying to jump over seven-foot bars.BECKY QUICK: You know, people will say, well, wait a second. You're in some businesses that some people have written off for dead: the newspaper business. How is that different?WARREN BUFFETT: You're right. (LAUGHTER) But — but we bought that [The Buffalo Evening News] in 1977.  And — and we've done very well over the years.  At — at first, we didn't do so well. But then we did very well.But I — the newspaper business of 2010 is not the newspaper business of 1977. I mean, it is diametrically different. [Berkshire sold the newspaper in 2020.]And it is true, and we put it in the annual report, that we run Berkshire in a way that they don't teach in business schools. Because in business schools, they say sell off your so-so businesses and keep buying new businesses. I call that gin rummy management.And when I — if I had 50 kids, you know, and one of them isn't doing quite as well as the others, I'm not going to put him up for adoption. Unless they are going to lose us money permanently, or if they have major labor difficulties, we keep the businesses that aren't as good as the others.So, if I'm going to follow that philosophy, I'd better be very careful about what I buy, right?BECKY QUICK: Exactly. What about your business partner, Charlie Munger? What would he say your biggest mistake is?WARREN BUFFETT: Well, he would probably repeat this. And I would say I've learned a lot about what I just got through talking about — I've learned a lot from Charlie.Charlie told me this from the first moment I met him in 1959. He said — he said exactly — I could have — I could have saved myself a lot of trouble if I'd just listened to him. But what did Charlie know? (LAUGHTER)BECKY QUICK: OK.  Warren, thank you very much.  We really appreciate your time.WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks.  Thanks for having me.Some links may require a subscription:NPR's The Indicator from Planet Money podcast: The worst year of Warren Buffett's careerCNN Business: How to put some of Warren Buffett's best money and life advice to work for youBusiness Insider: Warren Buffett's company took Kraft Heinz off its subsidiary list weeks before board exit and $5 billion writedownInvestopedia: What Warren Buffett's Snowball Metaphor Teaches Us About Life and Long-Term SuccessBerkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S. and Japan, by market value, based on the latest closing prices.Holdings are as of Sept. 30, as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel at a Neo Material Technologies Inc. factory in Tianjin, China on June 11, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China.A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry.It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity.The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon.\"Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had,\" Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call. Photo taken on Sept. 19, 2025 shows rare-earth magnetic bars at NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way,\" he continued. \"And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum,\" Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked \"a high point of Europe's sovereignty.\" watch nowNeo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond.\"Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years,\" Suleman said. \"And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market.\"'Skyrocketing demand'To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency.A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.  Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEAJohn Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible \"so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back.\" Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production.\"Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational,\" Maslin told CNBC by email. \"The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability,\" he added. Read moreSeparately, Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab, said the only way to deliver on alternative supply chains is to be innovative.\"The demand for non-China sourced rare earth permanent magnets is skyrocketing,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"The challenge is can United States magnet producers create a fully domestic (non-China) supply chain for these magnets. This requires the magnet manufacturer to take the lead and bring the supply chain together – from mine to magnet to customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Wires and cables in a server room. Thomas Northcut | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesNvidia has been the biggest infrastructure winner in the artificial intelligence boom, soaring in value by almost thirteenfold since the end of 2022 to a market cap of $4.6 trillion.While Nvidia's rally continued in 2025, investors betting on other AI data center plays made a lot more money over the past 12 months. With four of the biggest technology companies projecting collective expenditures of $380 billion on data center and infrastructure build-outs this year, followed by an expected increase in the coming years, Wall Street has poured money into an assortment of vendors that are poised to reap the rewards. Makers of memory, storage, fiber-optic cables, central processors and other types of enterprise hardware have rocketed in valued this year, driven by excitement around the AI craze. Investors will be scrutinizing these five companies closely in 2026 now that lofty expectations have been built into their stock prices. Lumentum watch nowLumentum, based in San Jose, California, makes switches, transceivers and other optical laser-based parts that are needed for fiber-optic cables. Customers have typically been telecommunications carriers and device makers like Apple, which previously used Lumentum parts in its FaceID sensor. But AI servers also need a lot of optical connections. Every graphics processing unit in a rack needs to be connected to every other GPU. Future AI systems will scale out, which requires optical connections from rack to rack. Eventually, entire data centers will need to be connected to each other with fiber-optic connections. Lumentum's stock price has jumped 372% this year as of Wednesday's close, lifting the company's market cap past $28 billion. Sales surged 58% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier to $533 million. \"Our growth is powered by AI demand spanning our laser chips and optical transceivers inside data centers, as well as the interconnected long-haul networks that link them,\" Lumentum CEO Michael Hurlston said on an earnings call in November. He said 60% of the company's sales now come from cloud and AI infrastructure.Revenue is expected to rise 58% for the fiscal year ending in June, but analysts see a slowdown from there to growth of 32% and 15% in the next two years, according to LSEG. Western Digitalwatch nowWestern Digital is one of three major hard drive manufacturers, along with Seagate and Toshiba. Shares of the 55-year-old company are up almost 300% this year. In addition to computing power, AI companies need increasing amounts of space to store applications and other data. In short, data centers need hard drives. While Western Digital makes solid-state hard drives, which use chips to store data, the company is best known for its hard disk drives, which use spinning discs to store terabytes or more of data.\"Data is the fuel that powers AI, and it is HDDs that provide the most reliable, scalable and cost-effective data storage solution,\" CEO Irving Tan said in October on an earnings call. He cited an example of a hospital that's using an AI that analyzes 7 billion images.In the most recent quarter, revenue rose 27% to $2.82 billion. The company says that selling more storage for data centers will improve profitability because AI companies need larger, more expensive hard drives.Revenue is expected to increase about 23% in fiscal 2026, with growth slowing to 13% in 2027. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of about $35 billion, more than half the value of Western Digital.Micronwatch nowMicron is one of three major memory producers, alongside Samsung and SK Hynix, but the only one based in the U.S. Artificial intelligence servers need a lot of memory to store and process massive AI models. Chips from Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices come with scores of gigabytes of the most advanced memory, called high-bandwidth memory. The chipmakers are taking all the memory production capacity, leading to a worldwide shortage and driving prices higher. Micron blew away Wall Street estimates for sales and earnings in its quarterly report last week, and the stock is now up 241% for the year. Sumit Sadana, Micron's business chief, said the company was \"more than sold out\" of its memory chips. In December, it even shuttered its consumer-focused line of memory and solid-state drives to save supply for AI.Analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a December note that Micron's results showed the best revenue and profit upside in the \"history of the U.S. semis industry\" — aside from Nvidia. Revenue is expected to almost double in the year ending in August, before dramatically slowing to 24% in fiscal 2027 and less than 1% in 2028, according to LSEG. Seagate An exterior view of a Seagate office on October 26, 2022 in Fremont, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSeagate, founded nine years after Western Digital, is also benefiting from booming demand for storage. The stock is up 231% this year. Sales rose 21% to $2.63 billion in the company's fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 3. The company said at the time that 80% of its sales go to the data center market. \"There is no question that AI is reshaping hard drive demand by elevating the economic value of data and data storage,\" CEO Dave Mosley said on a call with analysts. Seagate is unlikely to have extra hard drives in inventory, Bank of America analysts wrote in November, as any additional shipments will get claimed quickly. The analysts also noted that customers are signing build-to-order contracts with firm volume and price commitments. \"The extra units are typically purchased by hyperscale or other mass capacity customers,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the stock. Seagate's trajectory looks similar to Western Digital. Analysts expect 21% revenue growth this fiscal year, followed by increases of about 15% and 6% in the next two years, according to LSEG. CelesticaCheng Xin | Getty ImagesCelestica, founded in 1994 as an IBM subsidiary, makes switches that connect networks together and manage the data and traffic flowing through them.The stock is up more than 230% this year. The company sells many of its switches to the biggest AI buyers. Sales rose 28% in the third quarter to $3.19 billion. Analysts expect revenue growth to climb from 26% this year to 33% in 2026 and 34% in 2027, according to LSEG. Celestica CEO Robert Mionis said on an earnings call in October that a hyperscaler recently approached the company to build parts to connect liquid-cooled rack-scale computers for AI, and said mass production is scheduled to begin next year.  One boon for Celestica is surging demand for custom chips called ASICs, which are less flexible than GPUs but can be cheaper to operate for specific AI applications.\"Our largest and fastest-growing market presence is within AI data centers, supporting high-performance networking and custom ASIC AI/ML compute platforms,\" Mionis said. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday that Celestica supplies parts for Google's ASIC. \"The company should benefit in 2026 from being the leading provider of Google TPU rack level solutions,\" the analysts wrote.

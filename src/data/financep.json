    "body": "President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a \"Great, Historic Investment in Rural Health Roundtable\" in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday he may impose tariffs on countries \"if they don't go along with Greenland.\" \"We need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,\" Trump said at the White House during a health-care-related event.The comments show Trump, whose push to acquire Greenland for the U.S. has grown increasingly aggressive in recent months, turning to one of his favorite tools for leveraging power over foreign nations.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information on Trump's remarks.The Trump administration has previously said it is weighing multiple options, including utilizing the U.S. military, in order to take over the Danish territory. Trump asserts it is essential that America own Greenland — even though the U.S. already maintains a military base there — because of national security concerns posed by China and Russia.The White House has also said the U.S. is considering making an offer to buy the Arctic island. But Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly insisted that the territory is not for sale and has no wish to be absorbed into America.Trump's suggestion that he may wield tariffs to get his way on Greenland came after he described a similar strategy to force foreign countries to raise their drug prices.Trump has pushed to lower the cost of U.S. drugs by mandating that domestic prices match lower ones paid overseas.At the White House event Friday, Trump said he threatened the leaders of multiple countries to either raise drug prices as part of a \"most favored nations\" deal, or else face heavy tariffs on all their imports to the U.S.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said.A delegation from Greenland and Denmark, after meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Thursday, said they have a \"fundamental disagreement\" with Trump.Trump has greatly expanded the government's use of tariffs since retaking office, raising the overall average tariff rate to an estimated 17%.Many of his broadest levies were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The administration's use of that law has been repeatedly challenged, and multiple courts have found the actions unlawful. The dispute has been elevated to the Supreme Court, which could soon deliver its ruling on the legality of Trump's IEEPA tariffs. Trump has claimed that his agenda would unravel if the high court rules against him.\"I hope we win the Supreme Court case, because if we don't, [it'd] be a shame for our country,\" he said Friday.",

    "body": "CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong is interviewed for CNBC in the Russell Senate office building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 15, 2026. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersSenators are vowing to go forward on a major crypto bill that would give the industry the rule of the road after a planned committee vote was derailed at the 11th hour. But the biggest sticking points have been issues for months as Democrats, Republican, the crypto industry and banks have tried to find common ground. The likelihood that the latest version of the bill, which was released late Monday, would be able to get the approval of the Banking Committee was already tenuous when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that Coinbase would not be able to support the bill, listing several concerns including a reduced role for the CFTC and limits on the ability for crypto to offer consumers rewards in the bill.. \"It was the 1,000th cut in a death by 1000 cuts,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis told CNBC of Armstrong's tweet. A few hours after Armstrong publicly opposed the bill, Banking Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., formally called off the hearing, postponing it to a yet-to-be-announced date.  Armstrong told CNBC that after a new version of the bill was dropped late Monday night, he was surprised by some of the provisions in it. By the time Coinbase's team identified key areas of concern, it was too late for any changes to be made in a markup. \"We've got a chance to do a new draft and hopefully get back into a markup in a few weeks,\" Armstrong said.  Lummis, said it could take until February or March to re-hold the vote.  \"I feel like I got run over by a Mack truck,\" said Lummis, one of the biggest crypto proponents on Capitol Hill who has worked on similar legislation for years. \"But we'll get back at it after this break and find some ways to fix the bill.\" One of the biggest debates around the bill deals with the rewards that companies can offer stablecoin holders. Under the stablecoin law, crypto exchanges cannot offer customers interest on stablecoin – however they can offer rewards that act like interest. Banks have said the language could lead to hundreds of billions being moved from deposits to stablecoin – one Fed report suggests there could be a credit squeeze of hundreds of billion to as much as $1.2 trillion if stablecoin can offer interest.  Armstrong said he would like to speak with bank CEOs directly on this, but argued that the bill needed to treat both industries equally.  \"Crypto companies should be allowed to compete and offer loans just like banks,\" he said. Banks are also preparing to fight for more favorable language. More than 3,000 banks signed a petition lead by the American Bankers Association warning that allowing crypto to offer interest-like rewards \"will siphon trillions from local lending, leaving less money available for car loans, agricultural loans, mortgages, and small business borrowing that drive local economies.\" Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., said she's spoken with representatives from the banking and crypto industries, and she thinks if there is more time to negotiate, an agreement can be reached soon.\"Everyone agrees that there has to be a compromise somewhere in there, and making sure that we are allowing the innovation to grow,\" she said.Caleigh Keating contributed to this article.

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "The Nave Photon, carrying crude oil from Venezuela, is docked at Port Freeport in Freeport, Texas, U.S., January 15, 2026.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThe U.S. is securing about 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday, as the country has started selling oil from the Latin American nation after capturing its former President Nicolas Maduro.Washington has completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson, with more expected in the coming days and weeks.\"We're getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,\" Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event, without specifying prices.U.S. special forces captured Maduro earlier this month during an operation that Washington said was aimed at restoring political stability.President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuela would hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil currently under U.S. sanctions, which would be sold at prevailing market prices. In a social media post, he noted that the proceeds would be controlled by him to ensure the funds benefit both Venezuela and the U.S.That would just be the first tranche of oil, as the Department of Energy has said the oil sales from Venezuela will continue \"indefinitely.\"Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude reserves at about 303 billion barrels, but years of underinvestment have left its oil industry in severe decline, with output now around 800,000 barrels per day from a peak of 3.5 million bpd in the 1990s. Trump also announced last Friday that oil companies would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector, adding that the U.S. would provide security to ensure investors earn strong returns. He met oil industry leaders from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero and Maratho at the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.  Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.The developments come as global oil markets face a supply overhang that has weighed on prices in the past year. Brent futures inched 0.14% higher to $63.85 a barrel as of 8:33 p.m. ET, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $59.31. This follows a sharp fall on Thursday as traders appear to brush off tensions between U.S. and Iran. \"Venezuela's oil problem is not technical, and it is not commercial,  it's fundamentally human and political,\" said Baron Lamarre, former head of trading at Petronas and co-founder of Index.\"Until investors have confidence in long-term political continuity, capital will remain cautious, incremental, and conditional,\" he said.",

Mitsubishi agreed to buy Aethon Energy Management LLC's US gas and pipeline assets for $5.2 billion, the biggest purchase by a Japanese company in the American shale sector. Photographer: Takaaki Iwabu/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMitsubishi Corporation said on Friday that it will acquire shale gas assets in the U.S. in a $7.53 billion deal, including debt, as the Japanese trading house looks to build on its presence in the country's energy market.Mitsubishi is looking to capitalize on rising power needs from data centers, manufacturing, as well as LNG exports, by expanding in the the world's largest gas market, citing domestic consumption, production, exports, and further demand growth.It will acquire the assets from Aethon Energy Management in Texas and Louisiana in a transaction that includes $5.2 billion in equity purchases and $2.33 billion in Aethon's debt. Mitsubishi's deal comes after Japan's largest power generation company, JERA, announced a $1.5 billion investment in October in the Haynesville Shale basin on the Louisiana-Texas border, as part of Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge to the U.S.Last month, Japanese media outlet Nikkei reported that projects in the energy sector were likely candidates for Japan's investment pledge, although it was not immediately clear if Mitsubishi's deal counts toward the proposed investment.In a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Mitsubishi said that the investment will strengthen the earnings base of the company's natural gas and LNG businesses. It will also accelerate efforts to build an integrated value chain in the United States, \"from upstream gas development to power generation, data center development, chemicals production, and related businesses,\" the company said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Mitsubishi fell 2% after the transaction was announced.The company has multiple investments in natural gas, with projects in Alaska, Malaysia, Canada and Indonesia, among others. Mitsubishi has a total LNG production capacity across projects of about 15 million metric tons per year currently, and Atheon assets are estimated to add a similar capacity, doubling overall output. The company said it also plans to expand in the U.S. by engaging in power generation and manufacturing businesses that capitalize on competitive upstream gas projects.Mitsubishi currently has partnerships in upstream shale gas development with U.S. energy company Ovintiv in British Columbia, Canada, midstream marketing and logistics through subsidiary CIMA Energy in Houston, and LNG exports via LNG Canada and Cameron LNG.

Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration and several state governors on Friday urged the largest electricity grid in the U.S. to make the big technology companies pay for new power plants. Electricity prices have exploded in recent years on PJM Interconnection due in part to the data centers that tech companies are building to train and power artificial intelligence. The PJM grid serves more than 65 million people across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Its service area includes northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world. The Trump administration and several states signed a pact that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants built in PJM. Leading tech companies have agreed to fund $15 billion of new generation for the grid, according to an administration statement. The Trump administration and the states urged PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction to procure this power, according to the Department of Energy. PJM should also cap the amount that existing power plants can charge in the grid's capacity market to protect ratepayers, according to the administration. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright unveiled the plan at the White House with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. PJM representatives were not at the event. \"We have to get out from underneath this bureaucratic system that we have in the regional grid operators and we've got to allow markets to work,\" Burgum said at the White House. \"One of the ways markets can work is to have the hyperscalers actually rapidly building power.\"Utility bills are rising in many parts of the U.S. despite Trump's promise to lower energy prices during his presidential campaign. The issue played a major role in the landslide victories of Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger in the governors' races of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.PJM was six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement for 2027 in its most recent auction. Six gigawatts is equivalent to six large nuclear plants. Gov. Shapiro threatened to withdraw from PJM if it does not accept the proposed reforms. \"Make no mistake if PJM, this sort of faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act and forced to go it alone,\" Shapiro said.PJM said in a statement that it is reviewing the proposals laid out by the White House and the governors.",

He said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security and that only Washington can counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.Peskov added that Trump \"has said that international law is not a priority for him. The situation is developing along a different trajectory, and we, along with the rest of the world, will be watching to see which one.\"A spokesperson for the Kremlin was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.Read morePeskov's comments come shortly after the U.S., Denmark and Greenland held crunch talks over the future of the Arctic island. The White House meeting, which was described as \"frank but constructive\" by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, ended on Wednesday without a diplomatic breakthrough, although they agreed to keep talking via a high-level working group. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump said he doesn't \"need international law\" and that only his \"own morality\" and mind can stop him. Several NATO members have deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise, meanwhile, seeking to beef up the military presence in and around the sparsely populated island.A Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules is parked on the tarmak at Nuuk international airport on January 15, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | Afp | Getty ImagesDenmark, which is responsible for Greenland's defense, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have all confirmed plans to take part in the joint exercises, known as \"Operation Arctic Endurance.\"Earlier in the week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that it was unacceptable to say that Beijing and Moscow were a threat to Greenland, accusing the West of double standards.",

Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai during the press conference after his meeting with Polish PM Donald Tusk at Google for Startups Campus In Warsaw in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle on Friday filed to appeal a federal judge's ruling that the company held an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search.The appeal could result in a delay of remedies against the Alphabet-owned company while the legal process continues plays out. The 2024 ruling \"ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote in a Friday blog. \"The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups,\" she wrote. The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and in August 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act and held a monopoly in search and related advertising. At the time, Google said it would likely appeal the decision.Last Spring, the company and the DOJ participated in a remedies trial to determine the the consequences Google would implement. The trial included witnesses from Apple and Mozilla, as well as competitors from OpenAI and other companies. In September 2025, Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences proposed by the Department of Justice, including a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. The ruling was seen as a win for Google, with its stock jumping 8% following the news. Mehta finalized the remedies in December. Mehta stipulated that Google must share some of its raw search interaction data that it uses to train its ranking and AI systems, but he spared the company from having to share its actual algorithms. Mehta also wrote that Google cannot enter into any deals like the search agreement the company had with Apple \"unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.\" Analysts at the time compared the lighter-than-expected remedies to a slap on the wrist. Google is asking to pause the implementation of the remedies, Mulholland wrote on Friday. \"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products,\" Mulholland wrote. \"Ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology.\"WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabiswatch now",

    "body": "A U.S. move to seize Greenland could damage trade ties with the European Union, France's finance minister has warned, as one analyst told CNBC that tariffs or economic sanctions could lead to a \"trade war.\"U.S. President Donald Trump has ramped up talk of annexing Greenland this month — and has not ruled out taking it by force. Talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday over the future of the world's largest island ended without a diplomatic breakthrough.French Finance Minister Roland Lescure told the Financial Times on Friday that economic ties between the U.S. and Europe could be damaged if Trump were to move to take the self-governing Danish territory. \"Greenland is a sovereign part of a sovereign country that is part of the EU. That shouldn't be messed around [with],\" he said.watch nowWhen asked whether the EU would hit the U.S. with economic sanctions if it invaded Greenland, Lescure told FT: \"I'm not going there. I mean, obviously, if that happened, we would be in a totally new world for sure, and we would have to adapt accordingly.\"His comments come as a Democratic-led U.S. delegation is expected to visit Copenhagen for talks with Danish MPs on Friday.Trump has said the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. Analysts told CNBC that he wants to keep rivals out of emerging trade routes and, potentially, mining of minerals that are critical in industries like defense. \"Significant\" economic pressure in the form of tariffs or sanctions on Denmark by the U.S. \"could likely mean a significant E.U. pushback, where the E.U. could respond in kind, leading to a sort of trade war with the U.S. as well as constant headline risks,\" Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at Alpine Macro, told CNBC over email.\"This would rattle markets,\" he said. \"It would also call into question NATO, though we don't predict this happening, or NATO breaking apart. Domestic political and markets pushback would likely moderate any such pushes by the Trump administration.\"Read moreMeanwhile, European troops arrived in Greenland late Thursday for a collaborative military exercise. This shows the U.S. that \"this is primarily an allied effort,\" Maria Martisiute, policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday. \"If we want to reinforce veterans and defense in Greenland or the wider Arctic, it's not up to the U.S. It can be done via allied efforts.\"The exercise, combined with European leaders outlining their non-negotiable red lines, can \"send a powerful message,\" she said, adding: \"It remains to be seen how the U.S. will proceed in that regard.\"The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed to double its spending on Greenland in its latest draft budget.\"What is clear is that Greenland can count on us — politically, economically, and financially and when it comes to its security,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday.

    "body": "Da-kuk | E+ | Getty ImagesAs many Americans struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living — housing, groceries, electricity and other necessities — their financial stress is getting more attention in the workplace.In 2025, employer discomfort at their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared with 43% in 2024 and only 39% in 2023, according to recent research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. As recently as 2019, the year before Covid, that share stood at 22%. Since 2022, \"we've seen employers shift away from retirement as the top area of concern toward more of the day-to-day cost of living issues, and budgeting and savings issues,\" said Jake Spiegel, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"Employees are feeling the squeeze from above-trend inflation,\" Spiegel said.Paycheck to paycheckAlthough inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.7% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.The result has been a large share of households whose budgets are pinched by higher costs. More than half (57%) of employees live paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2025 survey of close to 90,000 participants in 401(k) retirement plans by Bank of America. While wage growth has generally outpaced inflation over the past two years, that came after a period when income lagged behind inflation in 2021 and 2022.Employers, who are interested in helping employees manage stress in order to reduce absenteeism or worker dissatisfaction, have been doing more to focus on the financial well-being of their employees.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

The study included responses from 406 benefits decisionmakers at companies with at least 500 employees and that are either offering financial wellness programs or interested in doing so.At the same time, a smaller share of employers say their efforts are making a \"large impact\": 43%, compared with 60% in 2024 and 73% in 2023. Employers may be taking cues from their employees when assessing the impact of their programs, he said.\"We see evidence in one of our other surveys … that employees tend to be less rosy than employers when it comes to rating the effectiveness of benefits,\" he said.Financial wellness designThe specifics of any financial wellness program differ from company to company. They could include, for example, benefits like payroll advance loans, short-term loans through a third-party and access to emergency funds through dedicated savings accounts or their 401(k) — either through a loan or hardship withdrawal.Other times, it could include offering seminars or webinars that focus on specific issues like creating a budget, investing or saving for retirement.Also, 68% indicated that their workers have access to financial advisors and 46% offer access to financial coaches. Sometimes, the company subsidizes the cost either fully or partly for workers to meet with experts one-on-one.\"Financial wellness [programs] with one-on-one sessions are a strategic way to provide more access\" to professionals who specialize in providing financial guidance, said certified financial planner Uchechi Kalu, founder of Greenlight Financial Planning in Los Angeles.Kalu is working with a nonprofit in Chicago whose employees are able to meet with her twice annually, via video calls, about whatever financial issues they are facing. With the employer subsidizing half of the cost, workers pay $118 per session, Kalu said. She said that when employers help pay for these kinds of sessions, it can make a difference in whether workers make use of the benefit or not.She has provided guidance related to a variety of financial issues, including budgeting, investing, home buying and affording overseas travel.  \"The one-on-ones are when you get to reach people in critical moments and help them along their journey,\" Kalu said.",

Before that announcement, collections had been paused since 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Student loan borrowers who fail to make on-time monthly payments for more than 270 days are typically considered in default on their loans. At that point, the federal government has the right to seize up to 15% of borrowers' after-tax wages — as well as a portion of their Social Security income and entire tax refunds, where applicable — to repay the debt. Roughly 5 million borrowers were in default, and that number was expected to grow to nearly 10 million in the coming months, the Department of Education said in April. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.After the initial announcement about collection efforts, the agency has changed course on the policy several times. In June, it paused the plan to garnish Social Security payments.Then in December, the department confirmed around 1,000 borrowers would receive notification of intent to garnish wages during the week of Jan. 7, with more notices to follow. On Jan. 7, Protect Borrowers sent a letter to McMahon cosigned by the NAACP, American Federation of Teachers and several other organizations, urging the department to \"immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers' wages.\"\"After months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people's hard-earned money directly from their paychecks simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement.— CNBC reporter Annie Nova contributed to this report.",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI sent a letter Thursday to investors and banking partners warning that it expects Elon Musk to make \"deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims\" as his lawsuit against the AI lab heads to trial in April. The trial will mark a public escalation of Musk's years-long feud with OpenAI, and the company's letter serves as an attempt to preempt and alleviate investors' concerns. OpenAI has raised billions of dollars from venture capitalists, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion.Musk co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit research company in 2015 alongside several other researchers and executives, including the startup's CEO Sam Altman. He filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in 2024 alleging he was \"assiduously manipulated\" and \"deceived\" after the AI company explored converting to a for-profit entity and established an \"opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates,\" including its multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft.  Musk departed OpenAI's board in 2018, but he has argued that he is owed \"the value of all intellectual property developed\" from his contributions, potentially amounting to billions of dollars, according to a complaint.  \"We have strong defenses and feel confident about our chances of winning the case,\" OpenAI said in the letter, which was viewed by CNBC. \"Regardless, based on the record so far, we believe this case is worth no more than the $38M that Elon donated - though that is not a guarantee.\" OpenAI declined to comment on the letter.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that the case will proceed to trial. The lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California.OpenAI said it expects Musk will make comments about the AI company that are not \"grounded in reality\" and are \"typical of the harassment tactics he's previously deployed,\" according to the letter.  \"Elon's lawsuit remains baseless and without merit, and our team is focused on ensuring the jury sees these claims for what they are,\" OpenAI said.WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures ‘continue to produce all-time highs’watch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, in front of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., delivers remarks at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

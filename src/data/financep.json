    "body": "watch nowLow oil prices give President Donald Trump more leverage over Iran, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday, speaking as the two adversaries teeter on the brink of another conflict. \"The world is very well supplied with oil right now, and I think it gives President Trump more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices,\" Wright told CNBC in an interview when asked about the risk of a supply disruption due to tensions with Iran. The oil market is closing monitoring tensions in the Middle East for any sign that crude supplies could be disrupted. U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $63.55 per barrel Friday. Prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, after losing 20% in 2025. Oil market analysts are generally expecting a surplus this year after OPEC+ increased output and as U.S. production remains strong. Trump has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with military action if it does not negotiate over its nuclear program. The president threatened Iran with strikes in January during a mass uprising against the regime, but ultimately refrained. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Muscat, Oman earlier on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\" Iran is an OPEC member and produces more than 3 million barrels per day. Wright expects production in Venezuela to grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day this year, after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro early in January. The U.S. has seized control of Venezuela's oil sales and President Trump is pressuring U.S. companies to rebuild its energy sector.\"It will be a substantial percent of global demand growth this year,\" Wright said of output growth in the South American nation. \"Venezuela is going to be another helpful stabilizer of energy markets.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares closed up nearly 8% on Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

    "body": "Nastco | GettyBitcoin tumbled toward $60,000 this week as investors reassessed its utility. And while there isn't one clear catalyst driving the bloodbath, one thing is clear: the crypto market is in crisis. \"There's nothing going on in the marketplace that should have necessitated this type of a crash,\" Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of alternative investment firm SkyBridge, told CNBC. \"And so I think that's made people, frankly, more fearful. ... You have to ask yourself, 'is it over for bitcoin?'\"Bitcoin fell as low as $60,062 on Thursday, bringing it to its lowest level since Oct. 11, 2024. That's more than 52% off from its record high of $126,000 hit in early October 2025.  The previous session marked one of bitcoin's bloodiest ever, with the token shedding more than 15% on the day. Its daily relative strength index fell to 18, putting the asset in extremely oversold territory. As of Thursday, other digital assets like ether and solana were also down 24%  and 26% for the week to date, respectively — a sign investors' confidence in the entire crypto market is faltering.Bitcoin bounces, but losses loom largeBitcoin was rebounding on Friday, with the token last trading at $69,631.97, up more than 9% on the day.But, its recent drawdown has prompted investors to reevaluate its utility, including its role as a digital currency or as a store of value. Simultaneously, institutional appetite for the flagship crypto appears to be waning as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds record outsized outflows, threatening to drive bitcoin deeper into the red. \"This time is markedly different from other bear markets, however, in that it's not in response to a structural blowup,\" Jasper De Maere, desk strategist at crypto market-making firm Wintermute, said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"It's a fundamentally macro-driven deleveraging tied to positioning, risk appetite and narratives rather than systemic failures within crypto itself.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin prices over the past yearOver the past few months, investors have grown increasingly skeptical of efforts to recast bitcoin as \"digital gold,\" or an alternative to traditional safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin is down 28% over the past 12 months, while gold is up 72% during the same period — a testament to the latter's utility as a hedge against macro risks. Conversely, bitcoin has often traded down alongside other risk-on assets such as equities amid periods of high macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, raising doubts about its utility as a safe haven. Nearly a week after Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff announcement on April 2, 2025, bitcoin had fallen about 10% to below $80,000, while the S&P 500 had declined roughly 4%. Separately, investors are also reassessing the extent to which financial institutions, treasury firms and governments are willing to adopt bitcoin — a major catalyst for the token in recent years. Large institutional outflows are mounting as investors brace for bitcoin to go lower, thinning liquidity for the token, according to a recent analyst note from Deutsche Bank.Those outflows are also noticeable among spot bitcoin ETFs in recent months, according to the investment firm. The funds have seen outflows of more than $3 billion in January, in addition to roughly $2 billion last December and about $7 billion last November.Additionally, a swath of Strategy copycats that emerged over the past year or so have slowed or paused their bitcoin purchases amid the digital asset's correction. Finally, traders have acknowledged that longtime efforts to market bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies have largely faded. While Steak 'n Shake and Compass Coffee have rolled out support for bitcoin payments in recent years, initiatives to make the asset a form of payment have largely died, particularly as interest in dollar-pegged stablecoins grows, according to Bitwise's Ryan Rasmussen. \"We're seeing Wall Street adopt stablecoins because it is a fundamental transformation of the way payments work, and bitcoin is just a different asset. It's not meant for that today,\" Rasmussen said, arguing that the token's purpose has evolved from that of a currency to a decentralized, nongovernable store of value. \"I've never paid for coffee or a sandwich with bitcoin, and I never will.\"And beyond those more immediate concerns, investors are also increasingly worried that bitcoin's underlying network could be hacked, driving the token to zero. \"It certainly is a risk that is seeing more attention from investors as they're getting more worried about [it], and I think you're seeing a little bit of that risk priced into bitcoin,\" Rasmussen said.He noted that Bitwise has allocated funds toward efforts to mitigate the threat from quantum computing.Nevertheless, traders' appetite for bitcoin has largely dwindled, denting its price. That's true even as long-time believers are still proudly betting on bitcoin, despite of the charts and the naysayers. \"I believe that the story is intact,\" said Scaramucci, adding that he bought bitcoin for his fund on Thursday. \"But, I don't have a crystal ball. … Who the hell knows?\"",

    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares closed on Friday up 17%.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

    "body": "Uber signs are seen on cars in Krakow, Poland on October 12, 2025. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesUber on Thursday was ordered to pay $8.5 million to the plaintiff in an Arizona trial that is the first lawsuit to be tried of thousands involving alleged sexual assault and misconduct by drivers on the ridesharing platform.In the lawsuit, Jaylynn Dean alleged that she was raped by her Uber driver in November 2023 while returning to her hotel.  The verdict, which was delivered in a U.S. District Court in Phoenix, found Uber liable for apparent agency and lays the groundwork for about 3,000 similar lawsuits nationwide that have been consolidated in federal court. The jury did not find Uber liable for negligence or design defects, and the company was not ordered to pay punitive damages.\"This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety. We will continue to put safety at the heart of everything we do,\" a spokesperson for Uber wrote in a statement to CNBC.Sarah London, a lawyer at Girard Sharp who is representing Dean, called the verdict a \"victory\" for the plaintiff in a statement to CNBC and said it \"validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk to demand accountability against Uber for its focus on profit over passenger safety.\"The company is planning to appeal the decision.The ride-hailing company has said it should not be held liable for the misconduct of drivers, who are classified as contractors on its platform. Last year, the New York Times reported that Uber received over 400,000 sexual assault and misconduct reports between 2017 and 2022, which was far more than the company had disclosed. In a report last August, Uber said serious sexual assault on the platform had fallen by 44%.Uber has taken steps to address safety on the platform and implemented new features, including an in-app emergency button and pin verification. In July, Uber began piloting a program in the U.S. that allows women drivers and riders to opt out of being paired with a man. Ridesharing rival Lyft has also faced lawsuits tied to sexual assault and harassment. watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Microsoft offer lucrative deals to promote AI, but even $500,000 won't sway some creatorsNvidia shares rise 8% as Jensen Huang says $660 billion capex buildout is sustainableAmazon leads Big Tech's $1 trillion wipeout as AI bubble fears ignite sell-offWhy Amazon's CEO is 'confident' with $200 billion spending plan",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has been working with the artificial intelligence startup Anthropic to create AI agents to automate a growing number of roles within the bank, the firm's tech chief told CNBC exclusively.The bank has, for the past six months, been working with embedded Anthropic engineers to co-develop autonomous agents in at least two specific areas: accounting for trades and transactions, and client vetting and onboarding, according to Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer.The firm is \"in the early stages\" of developing agents based on Anthropic's Claude model that will collapse the amount of time these essential functions take, Argenti said. He expects to launch the agents \"soon,\" though he declined to provide a specific date.\"Think of it as a digital co-worker for many of the professions within the firm that are scaled, are complex and very process intensive,\" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in October that his bank was embarking on a multiyear plan to reorganize itself around generative AI, the technology that has made waves since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. Even as investment banks like Goldman are experiencing surging revenue from trading and advisory activities, it will seek to \"constrain headcount growth\" amid the overhaul, Solomon said.The news from Goldman comes as model updates from Anthropic, co-founded by a former OpenAI executive, have sparked a sharp sell-off among software firms and their credit providers as investors wager on who the winners and losers from the AI trade will be.watch nowGoldman began last year by testing an autonomous AI coder called Devin, which is now broadly available to the bank's engineers. But it quickly found that Anthropic's AI model could work in other parts of the bank, Argenti said. \"Claude is really good at coding,\" Argenti said. \"Is that because coding is kind of special, or is it about the model's ability to reason through complex problems, step-by-step, applying logic?\"Argenti said the firm was \"surprised\" at how capable Claude was at tasks besides coding, especially in areas like accounting and compliance that combine the need to parse large amounts of data and documents while applying rules and judgment, he said.Now, the view within Goldman is that \"there are these other areas of the firm where we could expect the same level of automation and the same level of results that we're seeing on the coding side,\" he said.The upshot is that, with the help of the agents in development, clients will be onboarded faster and issues with trade reconciliation or other accounting matters will be solved faster, Argenti said.Goldman could next develop agents for tasks like employee surveillance or making investment banking pitchbooks, he said. While the bank employs thousands of people in the compliance and accounting functions where AI agents will soon operate, Argenti said that it was \"premature\" to expect that the technology will lead to job losses for those workers.Still, Goldman could cut out third-party providers it uses today as AI technology matures, he said.\"It's always a trade-off,\" Argenti said. \"Our philosophy right now is that we're injecting capacity, which in most cases will allow us to do things faster, which translates to a better client experience and more business.\"",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesBitcoin broke above $70,000 on Friday, just one day after narrowly avoiding falling below the key $60,000 mark, as part of a stunning rebound. The token rose to as much as $71,458.01 on Friday, up more than 11% on the day. It was last trading at $70,411.33 as of 3:16 p.m. ET. The forceful rebound followed the flagship cryptocurrency's dive below $61,000 on Thursday, marking a 15% plunge on the day. It comes as some investors are snapping up bitcoin after its more than 50% decline from its record high above $126,000 hit last October. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin, 5 daysThe reversal comes as stocks also rose on Friday, suggesting the market could close on a more positive note following a very volatile week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 918 points, or 1.9%. The S&P 500 added 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite traded up 1.5%.Investors' rotation back into risk-on assets drove stocks' surge amid fading fears over the threats posed by artificial intelligence technologies' to software firms. Several BigTech names rebounded, including Nvidia and Microsoft, which rose 6% and 1%, respectively. Those gains marked a stunning reversal from their near double-digit percentage point drops this week. Could bitcoin go lower again?Bitcoin is now trading close to its critical $70,000 level, sitting 45% off its all-time high. However, analysts said that bitcoin's earlier drop below $70,000 could signal further downside. watch nowOne firm, 10X Research, estimates bitcoin could go as low as $50,000, after a potential small bounce soon, Thielen said.\"I think we are going to have a little counter-trend rally that might go sideways or bounce a little bit,\" Thielen said. \"But I think during the summer we make another low.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks to reporters after the weekly Senate Republican caucus policy luncheon at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 13, 2026.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe rapper Nicki Minaj supports it. Elon Musk says it's critical to sustain American democracy. The SAVE America Act voter identification bill emerged this week as a hot topic in hard-line Republican circles and now may advance in Congress next week.The legislation, backed by President Donald Trump, is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives next week amid a pressure campaign from right-wing commentators and many in the congressional GOP. It sets up a showdown with Democrats and voting-rights advocates, who say such a proposal could disenfranchise millions of Americans, and with Senate Republican leaders, who are fielding calls to change the filibuster and clear a path to passage.\"America's Elections are Rigged, Stolen, and a Laughingstock all over the World. We are either going to fix them, or we won't have a Country any longer,\" Trump posted to Truth Social on Thursday. The president urged passage of a bill dubbed the SAVE America Act, which would require government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot and proof of citizenship to register to vote.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump posts racist image of Obamas, White House defends it and slams 'fake outrage'Sen. Slotkin refuses DOJ interview request over troops video: ‘The intimidation is the point’Hillary Clinton wants testimony on Jeffrey Epstein in public: ‘Let’s stop the games’Trump would decide whether to investigate Fed pick Warsh over refusal to cut rates: BessentDemocrats are among those who have bristled at the proposals, which are rooted in Trump's unfounded claims that elections are rife with fraud and come in the context of the president's recent comments about nationalizing elections and the FBI raid of a Georgia election office last week where Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this week that the voter ID proposal would be \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate and likened the bill — introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, in the House and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in the Senate — to \"Jim Crow 2.0.\"According to the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available and 2.6 million Americans lack government-issued photo ID of any kind. Low-income and minority voters are more likely to lack the types of documents that would be required by a national voter ID law, leading to less voting participation by those groups.\"The documentary proof of citizenship provisions would be extremely burdensome for a lot of Americans. Most Americans don't have a driver's license or ID that indicates that they're a U.S. citizen,\" Nicole Hansen, policy counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said in an interview.\"We really view the bill as part of a broader effort by the president and his allies in Congress to sow the seeds to question election results in 2026 that they don't like,\" Hansen said.The general concept of voter ID requirements has broad public support, with voting-rights advocates cautioning the devil is in the details. According to an August 2025 Pew Poll, 95% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats favor voter ID. A 2024 Gallup poll found that 84 percent of Americans support voter ID and 83 percent support proof of citizenship to register to vote. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and documented cases are rare.\"The American people are clear: they support Voter ID and agree that only U.S. citizens should vote in our elections,\" Roy said in a statement Thursday. But with Democrats vowing to block the bill, Senate passage is unlikely. Because of Senate procedural rules and the balance of the power in that chamber, Democratic votes are needed for legislation to advance there.A separate proposal, also introduced by Roy and similarly called the SAVE Act, would have barred noncitizen voting but did not have a voter ID component. Federal law already bars noncitizens from voting in federal elections, but there are provisions for them to vote in some lower-level elections. The House voted 220-208 in favor of the bill in April, with four Democrats in support, but it has not yet gotten a vote in the Senate.That has caused some members to call for eliminating the filibuster as it has been practiced since the 1970s and revert back to a \"standing filibuster\" — made famous by the movie \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" — which requires dissenting members to actively hold the floor in order to block legislation.\"The modern-day filibuster is a perversion of how the Senate was supposed to function. Instead of arguing positions and attempting to pass legislation, it has become a way to avoid doing the work and to block the President's agenda in the name of institutional supremacy, even though most of the senators got elected with help from POTUS,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., one of the most vocal in the House group calling for the passage of a voter ID law, posted to X this week.Luna, during an appearance on Punchbowl News' \"Fly Out Day\" podcast, floated the idea of tacking the SAVE America Act onto larger, must-pass legislation down the line.\"We should nuke what's called the zombie filibuster, which is the ability for Democrats to filibuster it without lifting a finger and that we should require an old-fashioned talking filibuster,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Newsmax this week.But Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has promised a vote on a version of the Republican election bill, expressed skepticism about filibuster reform.\"We will get a vote on the SAVE Act at some point,\" Thune said at a press conference earlier this week. \"With respect to the filibuster, I think we all know where the votes are on that.\"",

    "body": "Rafael Henrique | SOPA Images | APThe stock of Hims & Hers fell Friday after a legal threat from Novo Nordisk.The online teleheath company announced on Thursday plans to launch a cheaper, copycat version of Novo's weight loss pill, prompting Novo to take legal action.Hims stock spiked as much as 15% on the news in Thursday trading, but quickly pared gains and ended the session down 3.8% at a 12-month low after Novo said the action was \"illegal.\" Shares fell as much as 10% more on Friday before paring losses. It was last trading about 2% down. Hims said it will launch a Wegovy-style pill containing the same active ingredient as the original brand, semaglutide, for as little as $49 for the first month when customers sign up for a subscription. After the first month, the price will rise to $99. That's significantly lower than the $149 Novo Nordisk sells its starting dose for on its direct-to-consumer website NovoCare. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconHims & Hers stock has been volatile over the past year.Hims is launching its pill even though semaglutide has patent protection in the U.S. until 2032. The telehealth firm's business flourished when it started selling compounded semaglutide in an injectable format, using a loophole in U.S. regulation that allows competitors to sell a drug protected by intellectual property laws if the drug is in short supply.In the early days of the Wevovy jab, demand significantly outstripped supply, but Novo Nordisk has since invested heavily in manufacturing capacity and resolved the supply issues. There are no shortages reported for the pill version.Hims says that its versions are \"personalized\" in dosage, and therefore legal. Novo says the action is illegal and a risk to patient safety. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement Thursday.Hims is a volatile stock, inherently tied to its perceived ability to sell weight loss drugs like its Wegovy copy. Shares have hit highs of $69 and lows of roughly $21 in the past 12 months.Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny, who rates Hims stock at \"Market Perform,\" suggested the telehealth provider could also consider launching copycat versions of Eli Lilly's weight loss drugs. Lilly didn't respond to a CNBC request for comment.Meanwhile, Barclays analyst James Gordon called the $49 Wegovy copy a \"new concern\" for Novo.\"While compounded alternatives may attract cost-sensitive patients in the near term, questions remain about their regulatory sustainability and clinical consistency,\" he added.

    "body": "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during an event in Turin, Italy, Nov. 25, 2025.Daniele Mascolo | ReutersDETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa on Friday said the automaker plans to move forward as one company amid speculation that it would be better off selling brands or splitting up after disappointing results. \"Stellantis is a very strong global company that is very proud to have very deep regional groups,\" Filosa, an Italian native, told reporters during a media call. \"It makes all of sense to stay together. We want to stay together for many years to come.\" His comments come hours after the company announced 22 billion euros ($26 billion) in charges from a business restructuring that includes pulling back on electrification plans and reintroducing V8 engines to U.S. models.  Filosa described the actions as an \"important strategic reset of our business model, with the only intention to put our customer preferences back at the center of what we do globally and in each regions.\" He said the \"mission is to grow\" after notable declines in market share in recent years.In Milan, the company's Italian shares fell 25% Friday. On Wall Street, the transatlantic firm's New York-listed stock plummeted 23%. Filosa on Friday did not specifically rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of 14 auto brands that includes U.S. brands Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, as well as Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis-listed shared in Milan and New York\"We want to really manage our brands in the sense to provide to them the products and the technology that our customers, that are now at the center of our strategic reset, will tell us that they want and they need,\" he said. \"This is our core mission.\"Filosa said additional information about the company's plans moving forward will come at a May 21 investor day.Friday's announcement comes days after Stellantis executives met with the company's U.S. franchised dealers at their annual National Automobile Dealers Association conference with a message that the automaker planned to grow sales across its U.S. lineup of brands, according to two dealers who attended the meeting.$26 billion in chargesThe majority of Friday's announced charges — 14.7 billion euros — are related to realigning product plans with consumer preferences and new emission regulations in the U.S. Other charges include 2.1 billion euros in resizing the company's EV supply chain, 4.1 billion euros in warranty costs and 1.3 billion euros in restructuring European operations. The automaker also canceled its dividend for 2026 and issued a 5 billion euro nonconvertible hybrid bond.2026 Jeep Grand WagoneerJeepThe charges related to EVs follow General Motors and Ford Motor announcing billions of dollars in similar expenses due to pullbacks in plans for all-electric vehicles.Shares of Ford and GM were not as impacted as much as Stellantis, which also issued lower-than-expected guidance amid years of strategic problems with the company.Stellantis said it anticipates a net loss for 2025. For 2026, the auto giant is targeting a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit rise in its adjusted operating income margin.\"While charges were expected, the amount comes in above F ($19.5B) and GM ($7.6B). Expect shares to trade meaningfully lower today as a result. We continue to believe STLAM is a show-me-story. In the US, the company has lost substantial market share given high pricing and a perceived lack of product investment,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said in a Friday investor note.Past mistakesFilosa on Friday called out mistakes by former company leaders more than he has since he succeeded Carlos Tavares as CEO in June. Tavares, who was ousted in December 2024 amid disagreements with the Stellantis board, in a book last year reportedly said that the group's French, Italian and U.S. operations might have to be split amid pressure from its main stakeholders.It's been just over five years since Stellantis was created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021.watch nowThe merger formed the fourth-largest automaker by volume, but the company has run into significant problems in recent years amid its investments in all-electric vehicles, focus on profits over market share and cost-cutting efforts to the detriment of products.Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, declining from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.Stellantis' global market share has fallen from 8.1% in 2020 to an estimated 6.1% last year, according to S&P Global Mobility.  Correction: Global market share for Stellantis has fallen from 8.1% in 2020 to an estimated 6.1% last year, according to S&P Global Mobility.

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesThis tax season, some families could see a bigger tax break for their children due to changes from President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"Enacted in July, Trump's legislation permanently increased the maximum child tax credit to $2,200 per child for 2025, up from $2,000. That value will be indexed for inflation starting in 2026.  If you previously qualified for the full $2,000 credit, the update could trigger a $200 bigger refund or a $200 lower tax bill per kid, for your 2025 return, depending on your situation, experts say.     Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow Trump's child tax credit changes could impact your refund this seasonSome older Americans are 'unretiring' to keep up with cost of living: AARP surveyBitcoin sells off amid 'crypto winter.'

What to expectAs ACA subsidies expire, health costs emerge as top economic worry for votersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedIn 2025, some 90% of families with children received the child tax credit, and the average tax break per family was $2,520, according to the Tax Policy Center.Nearly 37 million returns claimed the child tax credit or credit for other dependents during tax year 2022, based on the latest IRS estimates.Here are some key things to know about the tax break, including who qualifies and how to calculate your credit. Who qualifies for the child tax credit  Families must meet certain rules to claim the child tax credit, including age, relationship, support, residence requirements and more.  Kids must have a valid Social Security number and be under age 17 at the end of 2025. If a married couple filing jointly claims the credit, one filer also must have a Social Security number. The IRS outlines other guidelines here. The child tax credit starts to phase out, or get smaller, once income exceeds $200,000 for single filers or $400,000 for married couples filing taxes together. \"It's not based on any expenses you incur,\" Margot Crandall-Hollick, a principal research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. \"It's based on your earnings … and if you have a kid that qualifies.\"  By comparison, another tax break for families, known as the child and dependent care tax credit, partially reduces up to $6,000 of care expenses for two or more \"qualifying individuals\" — typically children under age 13 — when parents who file taxes jointly both earn income. Families with a single qualifying individual can look to offset up to $3,000 of care expenses.watch nowHow the child tax credit worksFor 2025, the maximum child tax credit is up to $2,200 per child. If the credit exceeds your taxes owed, you can claim the \"refundable\" portion, up to $1,700 per kid, which is known as the additional child tax credit, or ACTC. Many lower-income filers don't owe a tax balance.\"You get more benefit if you have some tax liability to make up that $500 difference,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida. His firm is ranked No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.After the first $2,500 of earnings, the child tax credit value is 15% of adjusted gross income, or AGI, until the tax break reaches $2,200. Meanwhile, ACTC is capped at 15% of earnings above $2,500.The $2,500 earnings minimum and $1,700 refundability cap means millions of lower-income families won't receive the full $2,200 credit in 2026, according to a January analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday outlined what to watch in Wall Street's week ahead, from key labor data to big earnings reports from McDonald's, Robinhood and others. \"There's a lot going on next week, but the most important thing, believe it or not, is the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report on Wednesday,\" Cramer said. \"If that comes in soft, it means the Fed can keep cutting rates, and that's great news for the stock market itself.\"Cramer said the recent rallies in decent stocks like PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson suggests the market believes the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakness. The January jobs report was originally due out Friday morning, but was delayed a few days due to the partial U.S. government shutdown. According to FactSet, economists estimate the U.S. added 80,000 jobs last month.The \"Mad Money\" host then turned his attention to upcoming corporate earnings.CVS Health reports quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Although the stock has been hammered with other health insurers on the Trump administration's proposed reimbursement rates for Medicare Advantage plans, Cramer said it's the only stock in that space he would own. \"CEO David Joyner has done a terrific job and I think it's a fascinating time to own the stock,\" he added. \"They're the last real national drugstore chain now that Walgreens has been taken private.\"Meanwhile, Cramer said DuPont's earnings report that same day should highlight how great of a job CEO Lori Koch has done to improve the chemicals company. DuPont spun off its electronics business into a separate company called Qnity late last year, a long-awaited move that has helped kickstart the stock, which has soared about 58% over the past six months. DuPont is also a holding in Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio managed by the CNBC Investing Club. The Club booked gains on this stock into strength on Thursday. Tuesday also brings results from Robinhood. Cramer said this one has been concerning investors because of how closely its trades with cryptocurrency markets. Shares of Robinhood are down nearly 27% year to date versus the S&P 500's 1.3% gain. McDonald's releases earnings on Wednesday. Cramer described the fast food chain as \"blessed\" because while beef inflation remains an issue, its value proposition has improved for cash-strapped consumers. Finally, Cisco Systems is up to bat after the bell. Shares of the networking company have surged ahead of Wednesday's report, up 10% year to date. \"The stock's been soaring. I don't know. We have to find out if this is a company that's got less software [and] more hardware,\" Cramer said. Cisco is also a holding in Cramer's Charitable Trust. watch now",

    "body": "Two armed members of Iran's police special forces stand behind a country flag placed on an armored military vehicle during a pro-Government rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 12, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran issued a security alert early Friday urging American citizens to \"leave Iran now\" and prepare departure plans that don't rely on U.S. government assistance. The notice comes ahead of U.S. and Iran's scheduled talks in Oman on Friday, with little indication that the two sides have found common ground over the agenda of the meeting.  U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to take part in the meeting with a team led by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, according to American and Iranian officials.  The U.S. has issued several similar security alerts over the past month. The Embassy last urged American citizens to leave the country in a warning on Jan. 14 as Trump was weighing options for a possible intervention in Iran, including targeted military strikes.The talks on Friday would be the first official meeting between Tehran and Washington since tensions flared in June last year, when a 12-day war with Israel led to U.S. airstrikes that severely damaged Iran’s three main nuclear facilities.  Differences over the scope and venue for the talks have cast doubts on whether they will yield results, keeping open the risk of a U.S. military action.  The U.S. government has reportedly demanded Iran to discard its stockpile of enriched uranium, put limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and stop arming and funding militant groups in the Middle East. Trump has threatened military strikes against Tehran if it fails to agree to U.S. demands. Iran has pushed back, saying U.S. demands are an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and has threatened to respond forcefully to any attacks by striking U.S. military targets in the region and Israel.Little hope?The diplomatic moves come against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East with the U.S. building up forces in the Gulf in recent weeks. Trump has sent what he called a \"massive armada,\" led by aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Middle East in the lead up to the talks. The odds for a deal or de-escalation from the talks are low, as the core demands of both sides remain \"far apart and there is zero trust,\" said Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group. McNally projected a 75% probability that the U.S. and Iran will engage in military hostilities in the coming days, or weeks. Possible scenarios include a Venezuela-style blockade, selective or limited strikes and large-scale military conflict, he said.The talks were originally slated to take place in Istanbul, given Turkey's leading role as a mediator, with foreign ministers from regional Arab countries, including Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, invited to participate.But on Tuesday, Tehran requested a last-minute change of venue and format, asking the meeting to be held in Oman and to limit attendees to Iranian and American representatives. watch nowAs Trump has put U.S. credibility on the line, if Iran refuses to make large concessions, the U.S, president will likely feel compelled to act, McNally said. On the other hand, if the U.S. stands down from attacks, Israel could launch strikes against Iranian missile, nuclear and regime leadership targets. Tensions flared up earlier this year after a nationwide protest broke out in Iran. Tehran clamped down on protests, killing at least 6,883 people as of Wednesday, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group focused on Iran. Trump had previously threatened to intervene in support of protestors in the country, but ultimately backed out of taking military action.— CNBC's Asriel Chua contributed to the report. ",

    "body": "Roblox Corp. headquarters in San Mateo, California, Feb. 3, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRoblox shares surged as much as 20% in extended trading Thursday after the company reported results for the fourth fiscal quarter that beat consensus estimates.Here's how the gaming company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Losses per share: 45 cents vs. 48 cents expected by analystsBookings: $2.22 billion vs. $2.05 billion expected by analystsThe company said it expects first-quarter bookings to come in between $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is higher than Wall Street expectations of $1.68 billion.Roblox's fourth-quarter bookings increased 63% from a year ago, while the company reported $316 million in net loss for the quarter, a nearly 44% increase from $220 million the year prior.The company reported 144 million average daily active users, or DAUs, for the fourth quarter, up 69% year over year. Analysts expected 138 million DAUs.Roblox announced in its letter to shareholders that it no longer plans to issue annual guidance starting in 2027 due to \"inherent variability\" in the company's business. Instead, Roblox said it will focus on providing quarterly guidance. Roblox has faced criticism for putting underage users at risk, with multiple lawsuits on behalf of children who were sexually exploited on the gaming platform.The company said that late in the fourth quarter it began a mandatory age check for users looking to access communication features in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Roblox said 60% of its daily users in those markets had age checked while 45% of global daily users had done so.Roblox said the age-check rollout, which was completed globally in January, has caused \"a mid-single-digit headwind to engagement growth and a low-single-digit headwind to bookings growth.\" But the company added that \"the strategic upside is significant.\"\"Accurate age data unlocks a long-term opportunity to tailor features and content, increasing safety and civility, which in turn drives organic engagement growth,\" the company wrote.Roblox said it has found that the age checking has revealed its user base is younger than indicated by self-reported data. Among daily users, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, 35% are under the age of 13 and 27% are over 18. The company said it views its scale with young users as a \"valuable strategic asset.\"WATCH: Gaming stocks plunge on news of Google AI gaming toolwatch now",

Elissa Slotkin of Michigan said Thursday that she had refused to sit for a requested interview with the Department of Justice for its investigation over a video in which she and five other Democratic lawmakers urged U.S. troops not to follow illegal orders.\"I'm not going to be sitting down for this inquiry. I'm not going to legitimize their actions,\" Slotkin said in a videotaped statement she posted on X.Slotkin's lawyer also sent letters to Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, informing them of her noncompliance, and asking Bondi to order Pirro to drop the probe.The lawyer, Preet Bharara, urged Pirro to retain her records because of \"anticipated litigation concerning potential violations of the Senator's First Amendment rights and your office's vindictive and retaliatory investigation.\"Bharara, in a letter to Pirro, said that the message of the Nov. 18 video featuring Slotkin and the other Democrats \"is uncontroversial and incontrovertible.\"\"It is therefore perplexing that the Department of Justice has begun an inquiry into the matter. For the reasons set forth below, our client will not submit to an interview in these circumstances and on this record,\" wrote Bharara, who previously served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.Pirro's office declined to comment on the letters. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ.Slotkin, in her video on X on Thursday, said that the Trump administration's aggressive reaction to her original video to U.S. troops resulted in a torrent of threats against her, her family, and her staff.\"To be honest, many lawyers told me to just be quiet, keep my head down, and hopefully this will all just go away,\" she said.\"But that's exactly what the Trump administration and Jeanine Pirro want.\"\"They are purposely using physical and legal intimidation to get me to shut up. But more importantly, they're using that intimidation to deter others from speaking out against their administration,\" Slotkin said. \"The intimidation is the point, and I'm not gonna go along with that,\" she said.In the Nov. 18 video, titled \"Don't give up the ship,\" the former CIA officer Slotkin and the other lawmakers deliver a straight-to-camera address to members of the U.S. military.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Slotkin said on that video.The others in the video were Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump posts racist image of Obamas, White House defends it and slams 'fake outrage'Sen.

The boat attacks — whose legality has been questioned — have resulted in at least 126 deaths since early September, according to The New York Times.President Donald Trump raged against the video, accusing the Democrats who appeared on it of sedition and treason, while calling for their arrest. \"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Nov. 20. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"In a subsequent post, he wrote: \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"Days later, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump, calling the video \"despicable, reckless, and false\" and labeling the Democrats the \"Seditious Six.\" The Pentagon initially said it was reviewing \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, and then later moved to cut his military retirement pay in retaliation for the video.The lawmakers in late November said that the FBI sought to interview them. Kelly filed a federal civil lawsuit against Hegseth and the Pentagon on Jan. 12 over his punishment for the video.On the same day, Slotkin told the Times that Pirro's office sent the Senate's sergeant-at-arms a request to interview either her or her private counsel.In a court hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon expressed skepticism about the Pentagon's attempt to censure Kelly over his involvement in the video.

    "body": "Most people have a relatively consistent wakeup time. Fewer have a set bedtime, which could be the reason you feel lacking in free time during the day, says author and time management expert Laura Vanderkam.The logic works like this: Without consistent sleep habits, most people can be generally productive but struggle to stay consistently focused all day, every day. Without consistent focus, your task list can build up, leading you to frantically rush to get things done. And when you're rushing, you make mistakes. Now the time you intended on saving is being spent backtracking or playing catch up.\"The problem is that people will get enough sleep over the course of a week overall, but it's very disordered,\" says Vanderkam, who's written eight books about time management. \"One night, you're staying up too late and getting up too early in the morning. The next night, somebody's crashing on the couch ... and weekends are all over the map.\"In spring 2021, Vanderkam surveyed over 150 participants who spent nine weeks implementing nine preset rules for productivity, including sticking to a consistent bedtime. \"One of the people in my study called [setting a bedtime] the least sexy, but the most impactful rule of all of them,\" says Vanderkam. A July 2025 study published to Nature, a peer-reviewed medical journal, came to a similar conclusion. Researchers observed over 79,000 working adults in Japan and found that irregular bedtimes were linked to lower productivity and more disengagement at work. A bedtime \"gives shape to the entire day,\" Vanderkam says, adding that it helps you know how many hours you have to work with each day, which helps you schedule your time more effectively. \"We know the day has a beginning — people are a lot fuzzier on this notion that each day has an end, but it does. And everything you're going to do has to fit within that time. It's kind of a puzzle.\"Vanderkam set an 11 p.m. bedtime for herself years ago, and says the routine \"allows me to make more rational choices about what is actually going to fit in my day.\"Disordered sleep can also negatively impact your circadian rhythm, or your body's innate sleep-wake pattern, Rachel Salas, a sleep neurologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBC Make It in July 2022. To find yours, observe what time your body naturally wakes up without an alarm for a few days, and make 30-minute adjustments if you need to, Salas recommended.\"Sleep is a basic human need, and a lot is at stake if we don't get enough of it: our cognition, our memory, our digestion,\" said Salas. \"I can't think of one thing sleep isn't important for.\"Most adults need around seven hours of sleep per night, according to the Mayo Clinic, but sleep experts typically say that each person tends to need a different amount. Once you determine how much sleep helps you feel mentally sharp each day, use that figure to reverse-engineer your ideal bedtime, Vanderkam advises.\"Look at what time you have to wake up, count back the number of hours that you need to sleep, and we have a bedtime,\" says Vanderkam. Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "A drone view shows the Netflix logo on one of the company's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.Daniel Cole | ReutersPresident Donald Trump late Saturday called on Netflix to fire board member Susan Rice or \"pay the consequences,\" after she said Democrats would push for corporate accountability if they regain power in the November midterm elections.In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump described Rice, who served as President Joe Biden's domestic policy chief and held top foreign policy posts under President Barack Obama, as \"purely a political hack\" with \"no talent or skills.\"\"HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK,\" Trump wrote. Rice argued during a podcast last week that \"it is not going to end well\" for corporations, news organizations, and law firms that \"bent the knee\" to Trump, and that their deference is unpopular.\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice told Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. \"They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\" She added, \"If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, 'Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,' I think they got another thing coming.\"Rice served on Netflix's board from 2018 to 2021, and rejoined in 2023 after leaving the Biden administration. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's remarks, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump included a screenshot of an earlier post from far-right activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who said Rice's remarks were \"anti-American\" and urged the president to \"kill the Netflix-Warner Bros. merger now.\" Loomer also tagged Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr in her post.The comments come after Trump told NBC News earlier this month that the Department of Justice will \"handle\" the deal and that he'll stay out of their review, after previously saying he'd be involved in the process. The DOJ is currently reviewing Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery.Netflix has proposed acquiring WBD in a $72 billion deal that would not include the company's cable networks, including CNN. Paramount Skydance, in response, launched a hostile takeover bid for all of WBD, promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. The DOJ is investigating whether Netflix's proposed deal could hurt competition, and it's also asked how the company's previous acquisitions have affected competition for creative talent, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.As part of its review, the agency is also examining whether the streaming giant uses anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with independent content creators for acquiring programming, Bloomberg reported, citing documents.  Steve Sunshine, Netflix's outside counsel and the head of the global antitrust group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, told CNBC in a statement that the law firm hasn't been given any notice that the DOJ is conducting a monopolization investigation. Netflix's Chief Legal Officer, David Hyman, said in a statement that the company operates in an \"extremely competitive market.\" \"Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolize, is unfounded,\" Hyman said. \"We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we'll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.\"Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said last month that he's confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\"",

The president maintains a residence at Mar-a-Lago, and frequently dines and hosts events at the Palm Beach club.The man was shot by Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County Sheriff deputy at around 1:30 a.m. ET after entering the secure perimeter around Mar-a-Lago near its north gate and then raising the shotgun at an officer, authorities said.The man who was shot has been identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin of North Carolina, according to an FBI statement on Sunday. Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference on Sunday that \"a deputy and two Secret Service agents on the detail went to that area to investigate.\"\"They confronted a white male [who] was carrying a gas can and a shotgun,\" Bradshaw said. \"He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with him, at which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position.\"\"At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat,\" Bradshaw said.The FBI is investigating the incident.\"Secret Service acted quickly and decisively to neutralize a crazy person, armed with a gun and a gas canister, who intruded President Trump's home,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X.She also knocked Democrats over the partial government shutdown, which impacted the Department of Homeland Security, which houses the Secret Service. \"It's shameful and reckless that Democrats have chosen to shut down their Department,\" Leavitt said. DHS has been shuttered for more than a week. Democrats are demanding changes to how the department conducts immigration enforcement operations before agreeing to fund the agency, after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Trump narrowly avoided assassination in July 2024 when a gunman shot at him from a roof overlooking a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A Secret Service sniper killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.Two months after that attempt, another would-be assassin, Ryan Routh, was arrested less than an hour after a Secret Service agent fired at Routh as he lay in wait with a rifle outside a golf course where Trump was playing.Routh was convicted of trying to kill Trump. He was recently sentenced to life in prison. ",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAirlines canceled thousands of flights through Monday night and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine as another massive winter storm bears down on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts nearly 50 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were more than 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 3,800 flights on Monday, or 15% of the scheduled U.S. departures, were canceled, according to aviation-data firm Cirium. Usually daily cancellations are around 1%.More than 90% of the departures from LaGuardia Airport, Boston Logan Airport and 80% of those from Philadelphia and Kennedy Airport on Monday were canceled Monday.Sunday's cancellation rate was about 10% as of 6:10 p.m. ET, according to Cirium.Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26.

(Photo by Prakash SINGH / AFP) (Photo by PRAKASH SINGH/AFP via Getty Images)Prakash Singh | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia's trade negotiators will reschedule their planned visit to Washington, D.C., aimed at firming up an interim trade deal with the U.S., a person familiar with the development told CNBC.The development comes after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs as illegal on Friday. Within hours, Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to first impose a 10% global import tariff, before increasing that to 15%.The \"meeting will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient date,\" the source told CNBC Sunday. India and the U.S. are of the view that the visit \"be scheduled after each side has had the time to evaluate the latest developments and their implications.\"CNBC has reached out to India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry for a comment.India's chief negotiator, Darpan Jain, and his team were scheduled to start the three day-meeting in the U.S. later this week.India is currently facing a 25% reciprocal tariff, which was due to be cut to 18% after the two sides agreed to an interim deal earlier this month, with room for alterations.\"In the event of any changes to the agreed-upon tariffs of either country, the United States and India agree that the other country may modify its commitments,\" read the joint statement issued on Feb. 6, by the U.S. and India.At this stage, it appears that India, like other countries, will be facing a 15% tariff in addition to the most-favored-nation status rates (usually around 2-3%), said Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative and a former Indian trade negotiator.Rethinking strategySince the Feb. 6 announcement, both sides had been meeting virtually to discuss the path forward, according to a local media report. The in-person meetings, planned for this coming week, with the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Jamieson Greer, were seen as the precursor to the finalization of the legal text of the agreement between India and the U.S.India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said Friday that the interim trade agreement between the two nations would likely be signed in March and implemented in April.\"The 18% tariff negotiations were based on a certain premise of some benefits which is now gone. Now, both sides have to rethink their strategy, and the U.S. has to deal with more pressing issues,\" Srivastava said.",

    "body": "More companies are leaning into \"peanut butter\" pay increases this year, according to Payscale's Pay Increase Preview Report.The term refers to across-the board raises \"that are even and spread thinly, like peanut butter would be on a sandwich,\" according to career coach Colleen Paulson.About half — 48% — of surveyed organizations said that they will continue giving out pay increases based on performance, according to Payscale.But the report found that plenty of companies are contemplating \"peanut butter\" raises: Along with the 9% of organizations that already practice across-the-board pay increases, 16% said they were newly planning to implement the approach this year and 18% said they were considering it.\"There's always a tension in organizations of how to how to balance the needs of your high performers while taking care of the entire group,\" says Scott Hoffhines, a compensation expert and the vice president of rewards and systems at SalesLoft, especially when companies have \"limited resources.\"Still, in Hoffhines' view, companies that implement \"peanut butter\" raises should be aware that they are \"essentially giving up on their top talent,\" he says — and that could lead to morale and retention problems down the line. Why companies are giving 'peanut butter' raisesThe concept of \"peanut butter\" pay raises isn't new, Hoffhines says. Last year, for example, Starbucks made headlines when it gave 2% raises to all corporate employees in an effort to reduce costs, according to The Wall Street Journal.Strained compensation budgets could be behind why some companies are implementing across-the-board raises, according to Paulson. \"These companies are under so much pressure to cut costs, and this feels like an easy way to do it,\" she says.Fairness is also a concern: The Payscale report noted that \"tying merit pay increases to performance ratings has come under criticism in recent years for being too subjective and prone to bias.\"Some companies may view across-the-board increases as a more \"equitable\" approach, according to leadership coach and talent development expert Sarah Eppink: They ensure that front-line employees who \"don't necessarily have the visibility of individuals in HQ offices\" aren't overlooked for pay raises, says Eppink, who is also an adjunct instructor at Bowling Green State University.\"Peanut butter\" raises are also easier to execute from an administrative perspective, Eppink adds. In general, managers don't want to \"have to deliver bad news,\" she says. Implementing across-the-board raises removes the need for \"difficult conversations\" about why certain employees will or won't receive merit-based increases.The impact of 'peanut butter' raisesAcross-the-board raises may seem \"equitable on the surface,\" but they can be discouraging for high-performing employees, according to Eppink.When pay increases are no longer tied to performance, workers who are \"hitting it out of the park\" will question, \"Why would I make exceptional contributions when the bare minimum is receiving the exact same reward that I did?\" she says.In the long term, these employees are likely to become \"disengaged\" and look for other jobs, Eppink says.Companies may not see the impact of \"peanut butter\" raises on retention right now, according to Paulson. In light of the \"challenging\" job market and low hiring rates, she says, many workers are reluctant to leave their current roles — and employers are well aware of that. \"In a competitive job market, companies don't really feel the need to increase compensation in the same ways that they would in another market,\" she says.However, employees who feel short-changed today are likely to look for other roles when the job market is more favorable, according to Eppink. Cutting into compensation is \"such a short-sighted strategy\" for companies, Paulson says. Top performers will be \"out the door as soon as they can\" when they find employers that better compensate them for their skills, she says.During the Great Resignation, for example, people voluntarily left their jobs at record rates — 47.8 million people quit in 2021 and 50.5 million people quit in 2022, compared to 42.1 million in 2019. More than a third (37%) of employees said that low pay was a major reason they moved on in 2021, according to a Pew Research Center study.What employees can doIn the past, Paulson says she would advise employees who were disappointed with their pay raises to talk to their managers and make a case for a larger increase. But in today's job market, she knows employees are nervous to \"rock the boat,\" she says.\"Everything feels a little bit more tenuous,\" Paulson says. \"It feels a little bit riskier to go in and have those kinds of conversations with your manager.\" Still, it doesn't hurt to ask your manager if you could be eligible for any other benefits, such as additional vacation time.If you're considering switching jobs, Paulson recommends updating your resume, optimizing your LinkedIn profile and setting up job alerts to \"dip your toe in the water and see what's out there.\" \"You never know: You might find a great opportunity with people that really appreciate what you bring to the table and will pay you what you're worth,\" she says.Still, Eppink recommends taking a step back to evaluate the \"long game\" before deciding to leave your job over compensation concerns. \"I would not counsel anybody to use this one instance to make a life-altering decision as big as leaving an employer,\" she says, \"especially right now.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Armando L. Sanchez | Chicago Tribune | Getty ImagesThe Transportation Security Administration said on Sunday that its PreCheck airport screening lanes are operational, an about-face hours after the Department of Homeland Security said the faster security checkpoints were paused amid the partial government shutdown.Travel industry leaders said they received little, if any, warning of the changes to PreCheck, a program that allows its 20 million pre-screened members to pass through airport security faster than at standard lanes. Industry members spoke with DHS officials in the past few hours and expressed alarm about the sudden decision, people familiar with the matter said.\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" TSA officials said in a statement. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case by case basis and adjust operations accordingly. Courtesy escorts, such as those for Members of Congress, have been suspended to allow officers to focus on the mission of securing America's skies.\"The agency said that \"until funding is restored, all travelers should expect a process that does not sacrifice security. \"DHS early Sunday said that PreCheck and Global Entry and other program suspensions were scheduled to take effect at 6 a.m. ET on Sunday. As of 12:40 p.m. ET, its updated statement still included a suspension of Global Entry but it had removed its mention of PreCheck.\"We are glad that DHS has decided to keep PreCheck operational and avoid a crisis of its own making,\" Geoff Freeman, chief executive of U.S. Travel, an industry group whose members include major airlines, hotel chains like Hyatt and Marriott International and tourism boards around the country.The move comes as a partial U.S. government shutdown that has left thousands of DHS workers, including TSA airport screeners, working without pay since it started on Feb. 14.\"TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.Noem blamed Democrats for the shutdown. Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over immigration policy.\"Shutdowns have real world consequences, not just for the men and women of DHS and their families who go without a paycheck, but it endangers our national security,\" she said. \"The American people depend on this department every day, and we are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage inflicted by these politicians.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-N.Y.), pushed back, saying the Trump administration is \"choosing to inflict pain on the public instead of adopting common sense\" reforms of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.DHS did not say whether it expected to reverse its suspension of Global Entry or what prompted the change. The White House referred an inquiry from CNBC to DHS.Travel industry experts sharply criticized the move before it was reversed, which comes just months after last year's record federal government shutdown cost airlines millions of dollars and hurt bookings, according to executives.The sector's leaders have consistently complained about how air travel has ended up at the center of repeated shutdowns and have pushed lawmakers to ensure that essential government workers are paid during funding lapses.A government shutdown in 2019 ended shortly after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights. Air traffic controller shortages, already problematic, also spiked during the 2025 government closure, snarling air travel shortly before it ended in November.The government shutdown in the fall, the longest ever, cost the travel industry and other sectors $6.1 billion, the group said. Those disruptions affected about 6 million travelers.\"A4A is deeply concerned that TSA PreCheck and Global Entry programs are being suspended and that the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,\" said Airlines for America CEO Chris Sununu. The group represents American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and other major carriers. \"The announcement was issued with extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly, which is especially troubling at this time of record air travel,\" he added.Read more CNBC airline newsUnited Airlines is overhauling its MileagePlus loyalty program to favor credit cardholdersSpirit Airlines sells more planes, calls back 500 flight attendants from furlough ahead of spring breakFAA abruptly halted El Paso flights over Defense Department’s plans for anti-drone technologyPressure mounts on American Airlines CEO as carrier lags rivalsSouthwest ends open seating after 54 years.

    "body": "Gregory Beard, director of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Courtesy: U.S. Department of EnergyFormer Apollo executive and longtime New Yorker Gregory Beard says he wouldn't have left the private sector for just any job. But opportunity came knocking in the form of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who tapped Beard to run the Office of Energy Dominance Financing.Previously known as the Loan Programs Office and part of the Energy Department, the EDF is the largest energy lender in the world, with some $289 billion in loan authority currently.Beard first joined the EDF as a senior advisor in April 2025 from bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining, before officially taking over as director on Jan. 29.\"If I didn't feel passionately about Secretary Wright's message and why the president chose him, I'd still be in the private sector,\" Beard said in an exclusive conversation with CNBC. Beard has only been at the helm for a few weeks, but he has big plans for the agency, including dispensing capital at a record rate. And at a time when the energy complex is seeing a generational shift and natural resources increasingly drive geopolitics, the EDF can be a key tool in shaping the future of energy in the U.S.Shaking up the officeBeard says the first order of business was to reexamine the loans granted during the Biden administration, the majority of which were approved in the months between Election Day 2024 and the inauguration. The result of the \"turnaround job,\" as he called it, impacted more than 80% of the Biden-era portfolio, or about $83.6 billion worth of loans, according to the Department of Energy. Most were focused on emissions-reducing projects.The review process included making sure projects that stayed in the portfolio align with the Trump administration's energy goals, Beard said. All told, roughly $30 billion in conditional loan commitments were either canceled or withdrawn by the applicant, with about $53 billion worth of loans restructured, the DOE said.The goal was to protect taxpayers, and to focus on affordability and reliability, Beard said. \"This is not a reversal of policies — it's a protection of dollars,\" he said. Solar panels at the Boulder Solar 1 facility in Boulder City, Nevada, Nov. 23, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersThe EDF dates back to 2005. The agency has acted as a bridge of sorts for U.S. companies that might struggle to secure financing via traditional capital markets due to perceived risks. In theory, the rigorous process to secure an EDF loan could be seen as a stamp of approval from the government, opening up additional funding to help nascent companies and technologies get off the ground. Over its more than 20 years there have been hits — including a 2010 loan to Tesla — and misses, most notably backing solar manufacturer Solyndra, which ultimately went bankrupt.Under President Joe Biden and his climate-focused administration, the agency was supercharged, acting as a green bank of sorts. Staff quadrupled, and the Inflation Reduction Act grew available funds by tenfold.But with the new administration, the office has changed course, shedding the green angle that President Donald Trump has called a scam. In addition to an official name change, the agency is now focused on six areas: nuclear; coal, oil, gas and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal; grid and transmission; and manufacturing and transportation.\"Every project that we do will make energy more affordable for Americans, will help us win AI and will bolster the grid and get us out from under the China strategy to dominate certain critical minerals,\" Beard said. \"Everything we do will have a very specific focus.\"EDF now 'open for business'During the first Trump administration, the EDF was largely dormant. But now, Beard said, the office is ready to get going. \"We have direction. We are open for business. … We will, I think, invest this capital in America's future in record time,\" he said.The office has about 80 active loan applications in its pipeline, according to Beard. It's a mix of new projects as well as those that have been reframed to meet the administration's priorities, he said.The reorganized EDF has dispensed three loans to AEP, Constellation Energy and Wabash Valley Resources. All three originated during the prior administration. But Beard said the pace will soon pick up, hinting that an upcoming announcement could be the agency's largest-ever loan.\"The initial quarters were really a turnaround job for fixing what this office had done in the past,\" he said. \"Now we're focused on the future.\"The first soup-to-nuts loan from the EDF will likely act as a starting point for a \"wave of loans around affordability, reliability and increased generation on the grid,\" Beard said, adding that a \"big portion of capital\" will end up focusing on power costs.Affordability is becoming a bigger issue as the midterms approach. Electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation, becoming a pain point for consumers who are feeling pinched on all sides. For years, power demand grew at a steady clip, giving utilities, which plan sometimes decades in advance, visibility into future needs. But that's changing. Power demand is rising for a few reasons, including the voracious power needs of artificial intelligence, reshoring of manufacturing and broader electrification. Reliability is also a key issue. A lack of accessible power is seen as one potential bottleneck in the AI arms race with China. Increasingly frequent and severe storms, attributed to climate change, are another source of stress on the power grid.The Trump administration has announced a host of initiatives it says will help meet the demand, including earlier in February ordering the Defense Department to purchase coal power and keep coal-fired plants running. U.S. coal use has been declining for years thanks to competition from cheaper gas and renewables. Beard hopes his EDF can address the supply crunch. One avenue is to focus on maximizing existing generation, he said. \"We need to refurbish and refresh existing generation, not shut if off. And not make the hill that's already a mountain that much tougher to climb,\" he said.Newbuilds are also part of the picture, he said. \"We need to remember again how important it is to do it and to build. So that's really what we're pushing,\" he said.Permitting delays can challenge new projects. Many regions in the country have a yearslong backlog of projects that want to connect to the grid. Amid the supply crunch, some have criticized the administration's decision to cancel several offshore wind projects that were more than 90% complete. (Judges have since ordered construction to resume.) Critics think the administration should be more open to wind and solar, which can be produced at lower costs and in some cases connect to the grid faster. One way to compare costs across energy sources is by looking at the levelized cost of energy, or LCOE. According to widely cited data from Lazard, new utility-scale solar ranges in cost from $38-$78 per megawatt-hour. Onshore wind is $37-$86/MWh, gas combined cycle is $48-$109/MWh and coal is $71-$173/MWh. However, the LCOE fails to take into consideration the value of dispatchable resources as well as capacity factor, or the amount of time an asset is producing at its maximum output. Nuclear has the highest capacity factor at over 90%, according to the Energy Information Administration. Combined-cycle gas is at roughly 69%, with coal at 43%. Wind and solar are at 34% and 23%, respectively. Everything 'on the table' for new nuclearThe EDF has traditionally been an important backer of capital-intensive nuclear projects, which have at times come in over budget and behind schedule. And now, with the Trump administration throwing its weight behind nuclear and calling to quadruple U.S. capacity by 2050, nuclear is a priority for the agency. \"We can't lean in any harder,\" Beard said, adding that more activity in the space is expected in coming months and quarters. The agency is willing to lend up to 80% of the project cost, he said.Electrical transmission towers, poles and lines are shown in the early morning of a hot summer day in Commerce, California, Aug. 7, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersTech companies also have turned to nuclear to power their data centers given it's the only source of emissions-free baseload power. Hyperscalers have signed power purchase agreements with the likes of Constellation and Vistra at above-market prices, indicating how desirable nuclear power is — reactors are online 24/7, unlike wind and solar power. Big tech has also backed small modular reactor companies, or SMRs, which promise faster timelines and controlled costs.The EDF in November finalized a $1 billion loan to Constellation Energy to restart its shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island, now known as the Crane Clean Energy Center. The agency previously provided $12 billion to Southern Company to build reactors 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle, as well as a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to Holtec to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Covert Township, Michigan. At present there are no commercial-scale reactors under construction in the U.S., although Westinghouse — maker of the AP1000 reactor — said it plans to build 10 large reactors, with construction beginning in 2030.Beard pointed to Trump's extension of the investment tax credit as advantageous for the industry. He said the EDF plans to support these long lead time projects.\"We spent the last year costing out and creating the incentive structures to let this industry flourish again,\" he said. \"Our view is everything that is required to restart this industry is on the table.\" Breaking China's minerals dominance Another key focus for the EDF will be critical minerals, as part of a broader push for the U.S. to shore up domestic supplies and move away from foreign dependence. China has weaponized metals in the past by restricting exports of rare earths, and given it dominates metal supply chains — especially when it comes to refining — there's fear they could curb other exports.Beard said that the Department of Defense is working on solving \"crisis-level issues,\" but that EDF plans to back companies seeking to break China's chokehold on metals key for everything from consumer products to the power grid and AI. \"If China is in year 10 of a 20-year plan, we will intervene and support those projects and companies that interrupt that strategy,\" he said. Although the agency's reorganization meant a reduction in staff, Beard said it won't slow the pace of loans or hurt the quality of projects it backs. Instead, he said, fewer people will be needed because the EDF will focus on projects that can be replicated, rather than one-of-a-kind projects that don't make economic sense.\"I'm only really a professional investor and a new government guy,\" he said. \"The discipline is make sure we are doing projects that benefit Americans and will be repaid.\"",

Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%, one day after the Supreme Court struck down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda. In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be \"effective immediately.\" He also warned that additional levies would follow.  \"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been \"ripping\" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,\" he wrote.\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs,\" he added.Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET.The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for clarification.watch nowTrump, who is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, was dealt a blow Friday when the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies. On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling \"ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American\" in a social media post. He also attacked Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett after they voted with the majority in the ruling.

Republicans were more divided on the issue. Some slammed the Supreme Court for its decision, while others argued that Congress has the constitutional authority to implement levies. On Friday, stocks rallied initially following the Supreme Court decision, before pulling back and then recovering again. Investors expect the ruling could allay tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and possibly refund affected companies and reduce inflation.How the U.S. government will proceed with refunds remains a question. By one estimate, the U.S.  government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court decision.",

Index heavyweights SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics rose over 3% and 2%, respectively. The small-cap Kosdaq added 0.74%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.17% in early trade.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a press briefing at the White House, following the Supreme Court's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 20, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974. However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.1. The economic impactIn a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as \"narrow,\" though there are \"enormous potential winners from this ruling,\" particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026. \"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. \"The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth.\"Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.2. Some help for inflationThe court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year. watch nowInterestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.\"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed,\" Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.3. Relief for the marketFor much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.\"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets,\" said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.4. What about those refunds?Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a \"mess\" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.\"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved,\" Gardner said in a note.5. What now?The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary.One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away. Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures. \"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later,\" wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be \"all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

As American Girl turns 40, the brand is navigating more modern challenges: digital competition, shifting play patterns and an aging, more cost-conscious customer base. \"The anniversary is at precarious moment for American Girl and the whole doll industry,\" said Jaime Katz, an analyst who covers Mattel for Morningstar. \"Kids are more digital in play, and the [American Girl] brand has struggled.\"Around a decade ago, at its peak, American Girl was recording more than $600 million in annual sales. By 2023, annual sales had fallen to roughly $200 million — just a third of prior levels.While American Girl has shrunk back considerably from the mid-2010s, the brand has more recently posted five consecutive quarters of sales growth — one of the few steady performers inside Mattel's portfolio. \"Growing off a base that's down more than 60% doesn't mean the brand is back. It means it's stabilizing,\" Katz told CNBC.Earlier this month, Mattel reported fourth-quarter sales of $1.77 billion, falling short of Wall Street expectations after holiday demand came in lighter than projected and heavier discounting weighed on margins. Earnings per share likewise fell short, and Mattel issued a lower-than-expect profit forecast for 2026.Mattel shares have fallen roughly 19% since the Feb. 10 report and are down about 20% over the past year. Citi and JPMorgan downgraded the stock after the results, too. \"People are watching Mattel this year ... waiting with baited breath, because they are spending a ton and it seems unlikely they will be bringing in big profits,\" Katz said.A doll gets her hair washed, brushed and curled at the American Girl Salon at the brand's flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainLongstanding issuesEven before the Covid pandemic forced American Girl to reduce its retail footprint from about 15 stores in 2019 to seven U.S. locations today, the brand faced mounting competition from lower-priced alternatives at big-box retailers like Target's \"Our Generation\" line. A traditional, 18-inch American Girl typically starts at $135, excluding accessories, which can cost as much as $250 for a bunk bed or $275 for a beach cruiser. The premium price once signaled to many parents a mark of quality and prestige, said Laura Tretter, co-host of the American Girl Women podcast. But in an inflation-conscious environment, it's narrowed the customer base, Katz said.\"Parents are more selective about discretionary spending right now,\" Katz said. \"That price point [for an American Girl doll] looks steep to many households.\"Across the toy industry, companies, including competitors like Hasbro, are grappling with how to get kids interested in their products, particularly amid uneven consumer spending and, recently, trade uncertainty. \"There are so many more things today that a kid might be enticed by to play with,\" Cygielman told CNBC. \"There's also more competition today, and we saw in the past that tariffs can make an impact on the toy market, but we adapt.\"For many kids, play has migrated toward tablets, gaming subscriptions and short-form video. \"The definition of 'toy' has changed,\" Katz said. \"A iPad or Nintendo Switch competes directly with a doll. There are simply more claims on the same discretionary dollar.\"Overall, Mattel's doll and preschool categories have faced steady declines for the last three quarters, even after the halo effect of 2023's \"Barbie\" movie. Global dolls sales fell 7% in the latest quarter, while the infant, toddler and preschool segment declined 17%.Struggling sales for American Girl and Mattel's Fisher Price brand motivated activist investor Barington Capital in 2024 to push the company to streamline its portfolio and improve returns, floating the possibility of selling off the brands. \"American Girl is not a huge part of Mattel's overall financial profile,\" Katz said. \"Still though, for investors, the question isn't whether the brand is beloved. It's whether it's strategically essential. It was a drag on profits.\"A girl waits with her new Truly Me doll at the American Girl flagship store in Rockefeller Center.Luke FountainCapitalizing on loyaltyInside the Rockefeller Center store, those industry headwinds feel distant.On a recent visit, Lisa Kandoski stood gazing at Molly McIntire — the World War II-era heroine adorned with round wire-rimmed glasses, a navy argyle sweater and braids tied in red ribbons — just like the doll Kandoski said her grandmother put under the Christmas tree in 1990.\"It's not just a doll,\" Kandoski, now 40, told CNBC, her eyes misty. \"I sort of realized the impact Molly had on me as a kid. She taught me that you could be brave even when the world was scary, that you could 'do your part' even when you were small. She shaped who I am.\"That emotional alchemy has defined American Girl since it disrupted the doll industry in 1986. At the time, the market was dominated by either fashion dolls mirroring adulthood or baby dolls to rehearse motherhood. The original six American Girl characters — Samantha, Kirsten, Molly, Felicity, Addy and Josefina — came with books tackling subjects rarely taught to young kids like child labor or racism, and all dolls treated girlhood itself as a formative stage.\"American Girl remains a moral compass for many of us,\" said Tretter of the American Girl Women podcast. \"I love that girls today are still getting positive messages about inclusivity, friendship and going through difficult changes.\"Over time, American Girl expanded into publishing, film and destination retail while diversifying its characters, like with the 2026 \"Girl of the Year,\" Raquel Reyes, a biracial DJ and animal rescuer who helps run her family's Kansas City paleta shop.The brand's whimsical seriousness became a differentiator and fostered generational loyalty, said Justine Orlovsky-Schnitzler, a folklorist and author of \"An American Girl Anthology: Finding Ourselves in the Pleasant Company Universe.\"Look no further than the Doll Hospital where white-coated \"doctors\" triage patients, fit wheelchairs, perform eye exams, and apply miniature casts for doll owners of all ages.\"That's why people return,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"You're not just buying plastic and fabric. You're revisiting a version of yourself.\"And even though the dolls remain preserved in childhood innocence, their original owners, now grown up, keep returning to American Girl through podcasts, memes, cosplay and fan fiction. Some pass their dolls down to their children. Others buy new ones for themselves.\"There's something powerful about handing your daughter the doll you once slept beside,\" Orlovsky-Schnitzler said. \"It's also just as comforting to go back to the days of your youth with your own doll.\" American Girl is releasing modernized version of its original six characters for the brand's 40th anniversary.MattelA growing baseMattel is battling to convert that nostalgia into broader sales growth. So‑called \"kidult\" consumers — adults who buy toys for themselves — have become a coveted demographic. By late 2024, spending on toys for adults 18 and older had surpassed that for children ages 3 to 5, according to market research firm Circana. That cohort continued to drive industry growth in 2025.Mattel has increasingly sought to monetize its intellectual property through publishing, collectibles, entertainment and digital platforms. In interviews and on calls with investors, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz has said that mobile games and interactive platforms are particularly promising areas. However, \"nostalgia must translate into durable revenue and sales growth,\" Katz said. Lean too heavily into adult collectors, and a brand risks \"aging alongside its original audience.\" Pivot too aggressively toward digital trends, and it \"risks diluting what made it distinctive.\"Competitors have been doing the same. For instance, Lego continues to release more brick building sets aimed at adults like flowers, art and collectables based on millennial pop culture favorites such as the 1990s TV hit \"Friends.\" For American Girl, its 40th anniversary offers a natural inflection point to strike a balance between kid and adult fans, Cygielman said.American Girl is releasing modernized versions of its original six characters and publishing its first book for adults, centered on Samantha Parkington and set during her adulthood in the 1920s. At the same time, the brand is working to keep the next generation engaged through contemporary \"Girl of the Year\" storylines and investments in digital platforms, including YouTube, TikTok and \"American Girl World\" on Roblox.\"Nostalgia is an entry point, not the endgame,\" Cygielman said. \"The question is how we extend that emotional equity into new platforms and new audiences.\"",

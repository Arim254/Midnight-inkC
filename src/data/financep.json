    "body": "If you want to raise successful, resilient kids, help them find activities they actually like, says psychologist Angela Duckworth.Instead of forcing your children to try a specific sport or instrument, spend time exposing them to a variety of extracurriculars and take note of what they spend the most time thinking about, Duckworth said on an Oct. 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Guiding kids to activities they're interested in can help them find their passions, hobbies and maybe even their future careers, said Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who researches mental and emotional \"grit.\"\"I think great parenting, a lot of it is noticing what your young people is thinking about,\" Duckworth said, adding: \"When we begin to notice where our mind lives, when we begin to notice what attracts our attention spontaneously, that is the beginning of discovering the interests that can make us something of a genius about what we do.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterKids who learn to stick with their interests, even on difficult days, can develop their confidence and resilience — two traits that can help them find success later in life, said Duckworth. Your child might pick a sport or hobby and then decide they don't like it, but it's important for them to finish that athletic season, or keep rehearsing that musical instrument just through their next concert, she added.Duckworth referenced her own experience as a parent. Her child Lucy \"hated doing homework and practicing her viola,\" but when Duckworth looked at Lucy's iPad, she noticed that \"all of the tabs were open to baking videos,\" she said. Duckworth also saw Lucy reading their family's cookbooks, she noted.Lucy ended up \"volunteering in restaurants washing dishes, [then] was allowed to assist the pastry chef,\" Duckworth tells CNBC Make It. \"She was doing pastry literally every weekend and every summer all the way from 8th grade to, I guess, 12th grade ... Her lifelong interest in food and cooking is still evident.\"Not every interest has to become a full-fledged career. If you just follow what you like to do, you might not necessarily make much money, bestselling author and New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told CNBC Make It in 2019.\"Don't follow your passion,\" Galloway said. His advice instead: \"Find out what you're good at and then invest 10,000 hours in it — and become great at it.\"For Duckworth, interest is just one of four building blocks on the path to building grit, which her research shows is the most common characteristic among successful people in any field. The others include hard work, purpose and hope.\"Anybody who becomes great at what they do, there is a curiosity there, right? Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" Duckworth said. \"When you start talking about something that you really care about, you're a genius [on it], because that is where your mind lives.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Ask anyone what they think keeps a relationship strong, and they will probably tell you it's love. There's some truth to that: love is what draws us together in the first place.But after years of studying couples as a psychologist, and as a husband, I've realized something that research keeps confirming: The real factor that keeps couples together, long after the honeymoon phase fades, is compromise.Love alone isn't enoughPsychologists define love as an emotion. And like all emotions, love fluctuates with stress, sleep, health, and the thousand of other factors that shape our daily lives.So you can love your partner deeply and still get annoyed, frustrated, or angry with them. Love won't shield you from conflict, nor will it solve your disagreements.That's why even the happiest couples argue and have rough patches, regardless of how much love they have for each other. The difference is that strong couples know love can't fix everything — but compromise can.The psychology of compromiseCompromise happens when you balance what you want, what your partner wants, and what's best for the relationship itself.Every couple brings together a set of habits, values, and experiences. Expecting perfect alignment is unrealistic. Instead, healthy couples learn to negotiate their reality. They turn \"my way\" and \"your way\" into \"our way.\"But compromise only works when it's rooted in a strong sense of we.Research shows that couples who describe their conflicts using \"we\" language (we decided, we talked, we figured it out) feel more connected and satisfied after disagreements. When both partners see compromise as a shared effort, not a loss, it strengthens the bond between them.What compromise looks like in real lifeCompromise doesn't always look romantic. Sometimes it means agreeing to watch a movie you'd never choose yourself. Other times, it means listening to your partner vent about something while resisting your desperate urge to offer solutions.In my own marriage, I've learned that a relationship rarely demands massive sacrifices. Instead, you'll be presented with the choice of whether or not you're willing to meet your partner halfway.Today, it might be who takes on which chores. Tomorrow, it might be about how you spend your evening together. Next month, it might be about how you navigate your family holidays. It might involve finding middle ground, taking turns, or agreeing to something else that neither of you had considered. What matters is that you're both heard and respected, and that no one feels that they have to \"win\" or \"be right.\" When you consistently make enough space for one another's needs, you'll build something that love alone rarely does: reliability.

    "body": "The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. But figuring out the exact accounts to use can feel overwhelming.After setting aside money to cover daily expenses in a checking account and three to 12 months of expenses in a savings account, you should start looking into putting any additional income into three different investment \"buckets,\" says Jaime Bosse, a certified financial planner and senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.\"If you have too much in cash, you're actually losing money to inflation,\" Bosse says. \"Any extra dollars you have should be invested in growing for the future.\"With three investment accounts, you'll have more flexibility to tap your money when you need it and more control over your tax bill now and later because each \"bucket\" offers different benefits, Bosse says. How to best allocate your money across the different types of accounts will vary based on your income and situation, she says, but the bottom line is you should be using them to your advantage. Be sure to speak with a trusted financial professional for individualized advice.Here are the three buckets she suggests and how they work.1. Tax-deferred bucketExamples: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)Tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account, let you contribute pre-tax money from your paycheck into an investment account. This lowers your taxable income for the year you contributed, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.Withdrawals are taxed as income and usually penalty-free starting at age 59½. Taking money out earlier may trigger taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.2. Tax-free bucketExamples: Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b)You contribute money you've already paid taxes on to Roth accounts. Your investments then grow tax-free, and once you reach 59½, qualified withdrawals aren't taxed or penalized. Roth IRAs, in particular, also add flexibility by allowing you to withdraw money you've contributed at any time without penalty.These accounts are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future or want tax-free income later on, Bosse says.3. Taxable bucketExample: brokerage accountsTaxable brokerage accounts let you invest money after taxes and withdraw at any time without penalty. While you'll generally owe taxes on any realized gains, these accounts offer maximum flexibility for expenses outside of retirement, like a down payment on a house or a vacation, because you can access your money whenever you need it, Bosse says.Start by taking advantage of your company matchYou don't have to open all three accounts at once, says Patrick Huey, certified financial planner and owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.Start by checking to see if your employer has a company match program where they will contribute an additional amount to your retirement accounts that matches your own contributions.Early in your career, Huey suggests contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) instead of a tax-deferred 401(k) because you'll likely earn a higher salary as you get older — making it smarter to pay taxes now when you're in a lower tax bracket.However, even if it is through a tax-deferred account, \"if there's a match available, you should do what it takes to get it,\" because it's free money from your employer that boosts your retirement savings, Huey says.Using all three investment 'buckets' gives you optionsGenerally, experts recommend saving around 15% of your annual income before taxes for retirement, including any company match.Bosse says the purpose of splitting your money into three accounts is to give yourself options, whether it's to make big purchases, lower your current tax bill or reduce what you'll owe in the future.\"I would think of it in terms of not investing for your retirement, but investing for your future flexibility,\" Bosse says. When you have money in your three buckets, \"You can be working because you want to, not because you need to. You can travel the world. You can do other things.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe U.S. stock market continues to be volatile due to concerns about valuations of tech and artificial intelligence stocks and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Given this scenario, investors seeking passive income can add some dividend stocks to their portfolios.At the same time, investors might find it challenging to pick the right stock from the vast universe of dividend-paying companies. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend stocks with strong fundamentals. These experts assign their ratings after in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth potential.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Diamondback EnergyFirst on this week's list is Diamondback Energy (FANG), an independent energy company focused on onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The company recently reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Diamondback returned $892 million of capital to shareholders (50% of adjusted free cash flow) via share repurchases and dividends in the third quarter. It declared a base cash dividend of $1.00 per share for the period, payable on Nov. 20. At an annualized dividend of $4 per share, FANG offers a yield of 2.8%.In reaction to the third-quarter print, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on Diamondback stock with a price forecast of $173. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on FANG stock with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $156.Hanold continues to view Diamondback as a core long-term holding in the energy space, given that it stands out with one of the top core inventory durations in the Permian Basin and the lowest breakeven levels of $37 to $38 per barrel (WTI, unhedged, and inclusive of capitalized costs).\"FANG remains among the most resilient E&P, with leading edge operational, capital, and production performance,\" said Hanold.The 5-star analyst expects Diamondback to gain from the renewed gas-fired power prospects in the Permian Basin, supported by its strong footprint and natural gas exposure. Hanold noted that FANG is a part of the Competitive Power Ventures project, where the company has agreed to supply 50 million cubic feet per day to a 1,350-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine. He added that management is optimistic about securing more power/data center deals.Hanold ranks No. 69 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.2%. Permian ResourcesHanold is also bullish on another dividend-paying energy company, Permian Resources (PR). The independent oil and gas company delivered upbeat earnings for the third quarter, citing its dominance in the Delaware Basin. Permian declared a base dividend of 15 cents per share for the fourth quarter, payable on Dec. 31. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, PR stock offers a yield of 4.5%.Impressed by the results, Hanold reaffirmed a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price target of $18. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $14.50.The top-rated analyst stated that continued \"proficient operational and financial performance has become a hallmark\" for Permian, which he believes the company can continue in the years ahead. Hanold highlighted PR's robust operational performance that reflected a solid growth in organic production with no increase in spending.Hanold noted that the implied fourth-quarter oil guidance is up 2% to 3% from the prior consensus forecast. Accordingly, he now expects 188 Mb/d (oil) for the fourth quarter, which is 3% above his previous estimate. The analyst added that management seems confident about keeping capital spending steady at current levels while generating solid free cash flow, with dividend payment supported even at around $40 per barrel.Additionally, Hanold sees the possibility of an increase in Permian's fixed dividend in early 2026. He also expects the company to make opportunistic stock buybacks. The analyst expects Permian to use the remaining free cash flow to further bolster an already solid balance sheet (0.8x leverage ratios). Duke EnergyFinally, let's look at Duke Energy (DUK), an energy holding company that generates and distributes electricity and natural gas. The company recently reported better-than-anticipated adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, citing the implementation of new rates and riders, along with increased retail sales volumes.Last month, Duke Energy declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.065 per share, payable on Dec. 16. At an annualized dividend of $4.26 per share, DUK stock offers a yield of 3.4%.Noting the third-quarter performance, Evercore analyst Nicholas Amicucci reaffirmed a buy rating on DUK stock with a price target of $143. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Duke Energy stock with a price target of $135.Amicucci noted Duke Energy's strong third-quarter results and an early look into its updated capital plan expected to be announced in February 2026. Notably, the company mentioned a $95 billion to $105 billion plan for 2026 to 2030, with an equity funding target of 30% to 50%.Furthermore, the 5-star analyst highlighted that management sees continued momentum into the next year, expecting to turn large load economic opportunities into tangible projects with signed energy service agreements. Amicucci added that Duke Energy is well-positioned to add at least 8.5 gigawatt of new dispatchable generation across its service areas, including about 1 GW of uprates and 7.5 GW of new natural gas assets.Overall, Amicucci remains bullish on Duke's future growth, driven by its premium service areas, solid pipeline of new projects, and the fact that about 90% of its electric capital spending qualifies for efficient-recovery mechanisms, \"alleviating seemingly all regulatory lag.\"Amicucci ranks No. 693 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 79% of the time, delivering an average return of 48.1 %. ",

    "body": "In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.Cemile Bingol | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesAs more companies brazenly declare AI-driven layoffs in 2025, the first jobs on the chopping block appear to be junior positions and entry-level jobs.Graduate schemes and internships are at risk of becoming a thing of the past as major firms slash headcount in a push to deploy AI. Recently, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees as it aims to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes generative AI.Other companies that are leaning on AI and cutting jobs include Accenture, Salesforce, Lufthansa and Duolingo.Now, concerns are mounting over whether AI can do the work of entry-level workers and graduates, thereby raising the barrier for entry.In fact, 62% of U.K. employers expect that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will most likely be lost to AI, according to a new survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)And further data shows that the number of graduate roles available has declined in the past year. In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.In the U.K., the Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that just under 17,000 graduate vacancies in the U.K. had received 1.2 million applications highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people.As companies cut back on hiring junior workers, Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at Oxford Internet Institute, pointed out that recruiting entry-level workers is actually an \"investment\" in the future.Although they tend to make mistakes and require hands-on training, experts told CNBC why replacing junior workers with AI will actually backfire on companies in the long-term.'Leadership of the future'Healthy organizations cultivate their own talent and it's not feasible to hire for all positions externally, according to Chris Eldridge, UKI and North America CEO of tech recruitment firm Robert Walters\"If you remove too many junior roles, you can starve the internal talent pipeline,\" Eldridge said.\"Entry-level, junior-level roles are the breeding ground for the leadership of the future. I think if you overcut that junior layer, you will have a talent bottleneck at some point in the business that leads invariably to an increase in hiring costs.\"If a company doesn't have enough young talent, it will be forced to hire from the outside in the future and will create a \"talent doom cycle\" which will result in increased costs, salary inflation, and a dependency on the external talent market.\"I represent a talent consultancy, however, we would advise every organization to have several routes to talent in the market, and one of them is to create your own,\" Eldridge said.\"Also talent retention is very important through the training development and opportunities you can give people… but you're missing a significant aspect of growth if you shut down the pipeline on bringing junior or entry-level talent into an organization,\" he added.'Generational bridge'Companies that don't nurture young talent will eventually lose touch with consumers and mainstream culture, according to Oxford Internet Institute's Stephany.\"A firm is part of society, and if it doesn't reflect society adequately, it's very hard for me to imagine a business model or product that doesn't need this generational bridge…and young people bring in fresh ideas that bring a new perspective,\" Stephany said to CNBC Make It.Firms that fail to adapt and hire junior employees will become \"like an elderly homes company,\" Stephany said. \"It's like a company of soon to be retired people because… they might not have the edge and the vibe that you need to bring in a new product to the market.\"Eldridge agreed noting that there's a stereotype that all good ideas come from the top but \"a very healthy percentage of great ideas in the company come from people within their first two or three years in an organization because they see it with fresh eyes.\"An additional bonus of having young people in an organization is the opportunity for reverse mentoring, particularly as young people bring a crucial knowledge of technology, and losing that would be a \"genuine threat\" to organizations.\"If anything erodes that opportunity for mentorship both ways and that knowledge transfer both ways, it will drive down institutional knowledge or create institutional gaps,\" he said.Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" last week that the tech firm plans to hire 11,000 interns in the age of AI in order to upskill the next generation but also bring fresh new ideas.\"50-year-old CEOs like myself aren't going to be the ones to teach companies how to take advantage of AI. We need to learn from the next generation,\" Prince said.'Culture carriers'\"Tacit knowledge\" is an important element to keeping an organization healthy, according to Stephany. It refers to the implicit and unspoken information about a company's culture that colleagues' share.\"There are so many things that make a company work that are nowhere to be written down,\" he said. \"They emerge from the network of people, those people that sit sometimes in the cafeteria that say 'I've been with the company for 25 years, I can explain you what what's going on, why X has a problem with Y.\"That's the type of company wisdom of tacit knowledge that's a lubricant for the economic wellbeing of the company,\" he said.Robert Walters' Eldridge added that young people are sponges and \"absorb the best of a business\" including this type of tacit knowledge that can only be passed on through people.\"They're the culture carriers of the future as well so if you're not bringing that cohort in that what does that mean down the road in terms of culture?\"\"I think businesses rely on that upwards pressure, where you bring in a cohort of inexperienced people, they are hungry, they want to learn. They ask an awful lot to organizations, which sometimes test them and keeps a company on its toes. if you don't have that it could potentially end up being a detriment to the culture and to the performance of an organization,\" Eldridge added.",

    "body": "Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhen incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when McMillon has been Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "I'd imagine people usually feel anxious about making a drastic life change like picking up and moving to a new country. But I remember sitting in the airport in Los Angeles, Tony Tony Chopper water bottle in hand, feeling excited and eager to start my new life. All I could think about was finding a favorite matcha cafe to spend my mornings in after touching down in Tokyo. Growing up in Southern California, I had always been interested in Japanese culture and cuisine. During the pandemic, I became obsessed with anime: the characters who never gave up, the friendships, the quiet slice-of-life moments. I was infatuated with the sound of the language and the minimalist aesthetic. The shows made me want to experience it all for myself. In January 2025, a little less than a year after I graduated from UC Irvine, I boarded that flight to move to Japan. Escaping financial pressureI've never been someone who followed the \"safe path.\" Even in college, where I studied business administration and management, I avoided internships that would lead to a 9-to-5 corporate career. Deep down, I knew I wanted more freedom than that.But freedom is expensive in America. I was working four jobs after graduation — as a full time visual merchandiser at Lululemon, owner of a small sticker business, real estate sign manager, and organizational manager at a lacrosse club. I felt weighed down by the financial pressure of just existing. It felt impossible to be able to afford rent, health care, and other basics without getting a corporate job.So when I stumbled across an ad in June 2024 about teaching English in Japan with an Eikaiwa, or conversation school, I applied on a whim. I went through an all-day interview process and got the job. I didn't hesitate. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAlthough they were supportive, everyone around me thought I was crazy for leaving behind a seemingly stable life in California. Why wouldn't I want to be close to family and a long-term boyfriend? But Japan had been calling me for years, and this felt like my chance. Six months of paperwork, packing, and goodbyes later, I was on my way. Living in JapanWhen I arrived in Japan, something about it immediately felt right. Best of all, I could afford to live alone. For 74,460 yen (or $483 a month), I ended up in an apartment in Nakahara-ku, which is part of Kawasaki City and about 15 minutes by train to Tokyo. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItMy apartment has plenty of natural light and even a tatami room (a traditional room with straw mat flooring for tea ceremonies), just like the ones I'd seen in anime. In the U.S., I'd never be able to afford something like this on my own. In Japan, it felt attainable, even comfortable, on my 277,500 yen (about $1,800) a month teaching salary.The cost of living surprised me in other ways, too. A filling meal in Tokyo — like a traditional teishoku (meal set) with a beef rice bowl, miso soup, eggs, and a drink  — could cost just 1,000 yen (about $6), compared to the $20 I was used to paying in California. My company covered my commuting costs and groceries didn't break the bank. For the first time, my basic needs were covered without me constantly worrying. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItTeaching was never my passion, though. It was an \"in\" that allowed me to move to Japan, and for that I'll always be grateful. But after about six months, I realized I wanted something different.Now I make social media content for a language app for $175 a week and work as a freelance digital marketing assistant for $25 an hour. The number of hours for the latter has varied so far from about 50 in August to three in September when we were in between clients to 22 in October, since I traveled to Hawaii and Okinawa that month.Being here has freed up not just money, but mental space. I can focus on pursuing hobbies like creating content about moving abroad, going to the gym, studying Japanese, and connecting with locals, instead of always stressing about how to make ends meet.Dealing with downsidesMoving hasn't been without challenges. Sometimes the language barrier feels frustrating and overwhelming, like when I need to go to the bank or post office, call my phone carrier, or navigate a doctor's appointment. I often rely on AI to translate or ask a friend to help. This, in part, is what motivates me to learn the language better. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAnd I miss my friends and family back in California. There are days when I feel the sting of loneliness despite being surrounded by millions of people. I'm an extrovert, but even for me it can get tiring to go out of my way to overcome the language barrier and make friends. These struggles have made me more independent and patient, though. And when I slide the door shut on my tatami room and step out of my apartment each morning, I feel a mix of belonging and gratitude. This is my chance to live the life I dreamed about while watching anime as a teenager. I don't know how long I'll stay in Japan. But for now, I'm cherishing every moment. I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.Ashley Peters is a digital creator and marketing assistant based in Japan, sharing stories about life abroad, language learning, and creative growth.

The CooperVision segment is involved in the contact lens industry, while the CooperSurgical segment is involved in the fertility and women's health care market through its diversified portfolio of products and services, including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperVision's products include MyDay daily disposable, MyDay daily disposable toric, MyDay Energys, MyDay multifocal, Biofinity & Biofinity XR, Biofinity Energys. CooperSurgical's portfolio includes INSORB, Lone Star, and the Doppler Blood Flow Monitor. It also offers a suite of single-use cordless surgical retractors with an integrated multi-light-emitting diode (LED) light source and dual smoke evacuation channels, and single-use surgical suction devices with an integrated, cordless radial LED light source.Stock Market Value: $14.41 billion ($72.49 per share)Activist: Jana PartnersOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy \"V cubed.\" The three \"Vs\" were: (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three \"Ss\": (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.What's happeningOn Oct. 20, Jana announced that they took a position in Cooper Cos. and plan to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb.Behind the scenesCooper Cos. is a leading global medical device company operating through two segments: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision (66% of revenue) is focused on the sale of contact lenses. CooperVision is the global leader by contact wearers and second in terms of market share (26%), competing against Johnson and Johnson (37%), Alcon (26%), and Bausch + Lomb (10%).The global soft contact lens market is estimated to be worth about $11 billion and is growing at 4% to 6% annually. The segment has numerous tailwinds including a steady shift into silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses (about 40% of consumers are still using non-daily lenses), global growth in contact users, and high barriers to entry for competitors. As such, this is a great business that generates EBITDA margins in the mid-30s.CooperSurgical (33% of revenue) is focused on women's health services, with 60% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue derived from office and surgical (Paragard IUDs, stem cell cryostorage, medical devices) and 40% from fertility (IVF consumables, equipment, genomic and donor services). Fertility treatment is a $2 billion global market, also expected to grow at a 4% to 6% pace annually.For most of its history, Cooper was a pureplay vision business, until they added CooperSurgical in the 90s. Initially, this was a small – arguably tax-motivated – add-on. However, the company began heavily investing in this segment in 2017 – spending over $3 billion on the segment since.The problem with this shift is pretty clear – Cooper is effectively siphoning off cash from a really good contact lens business and then reinvesting it in what most people would judge to be a less attractive business. This is evident in the company's declining returns on capital, with CooperSurgical now operating at lower margins than they did in 2017 despite these massive investments.A key factor behind this operational shift may be management changes. The company's CEO Albert White, who previously led CooperSurgical, assumed leadership shortly after this expansion began. This raises a larger question about the company's strategic focus, leading many to question why the leader of this company would not have expertise in its core business.These strategic missteps have been further compounded by near-term headwinds across both segments, some self-inflicted. For CooperVision, the company mismanaged market expectations for the rollout of its new daily lens product, MyDay Energys, which is now behind schedule.For CooperSurgical, its highest quality business, IVF, has slowed meaningfully, likely attributable to comments from President Donald Trump suggesting potential reimbursements for IVF costs, causing patients to delay treatment in anticipation of this potential coverage. As a result, top-line organic growth fell meaningfully below expectations to 2%, down from 7% the prior quarter, forcing Cooper to significantly lower its full-year guidance at its third-quarter earnings call, sending the company's share price down 12.85% the following day. Now, Cooper is trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 16.4x — a steep discount to its 10-year average of 23.1x.All of this has prompted Jana Partners to announce a top portfolio position in Cooper and plans to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb. While a transaction of this nature would typically raise some antitrust concerns, this may actually be the opposite case here.First, a merger would not result in a market leader, as the combined market share of 36% would be just below market leader J&J's share of 37% and not too far ahead of Alcon's 26% share.Secondly, these businesses are highly complementary with minimal geographical and product overlap, suggesting a reduction in the likelihood of regulatory hurdles. Notably, Bausch + Lomb has not been shy about their potential interest and also sees no regulatory issues, as CEO Brent Saunders has publicly stated that a potential combination with Cooper would \"strengthen competition and create a more scaled company in the contact lens segment.\"But Bausch + Lomb is not the only potential acquirer. Companies like European eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica could also have interest and with even less regulatory uncertainty.As for CooperSurgical, there would certainly be private equity interest, as evidenced by Blackstone and TPG nearing a deal to acquire peer Hologic. However, Cooper shareholders may realize more value from the company cleaning up this portfolio internally – focusing more on the higher-multiple IVF business, shedding certain non-core assets, and potentially putting in new operators to execute a strong turnaround.Overall, with short-term headwinds likely to ease, Cooper has multiple avenues to recover its discount and open itself up for a potential rerating. Jana's thesis is straightforward: these two businesses make no sense under the same roof and a strategic combination for the vision business could yield $300 million to 500 million synergies, which is a lot for a business with $850 million in EBITDA. But step one in their plan is convincing management that separating the two businesses is the right strategic move; and despite growing public attention, there is no guarantee that management, especially with this type of operating history, will agree.Should management resist, this campaign changes dramatically from a strategic thesis to a leadership/governance thesis, likely centered on appointing a new CEO with a deep background in the contact lens industry to refocus the company on its core, while still positioning it for a separation down the line.Jana is not outwardly calling for a management change and White may even be the best person to lead a standalone CooperSurgical business. But activism is about the power of the argument and Jana seems to make a persuasive one here. Let's hope for all involved that management sees it that way.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump is blaming the meat packers and U.S. cattlemen for rising beef prices, but the tariffs on beef from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, feed, farm equipment and machinery are all adding to the price surge.The United States is a big buyer of Australian, Brazilian, and New Zealand beef exports.Brazil is the second-largest beef-producing country and the largest beef-exporting country in the world.Brazilian beef exports tracked by Panjiva plummeted in July and August after multiple tariffs resulted in a layered 76.4% total rate being implemented for Brazilian beef. Trump imposed a 50% tariff rate for many Brazilian goods in July. Beef exports have found a new home, being diverted to other markets like China.Exports of beef from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay to the U.S. have also decreased as a result of tariffs.The pullback in exports has reduced supply and is adding to pressures in an already tight U.S. beef supply chain.\"When you impose an extra 50% tariff on a major supplier like Brazil, importers may keep buying and pass costs along, or they may stop buying, but that means less supply to meet the demand,\" said Dan Anthony, president of economic research firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Either way, you expect prices to go up, especially when imports from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and other key suppliers face new tariffs too,\" he added.The most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September showed prices for a variety of uncooked beef products rising year over year between 12% and 18%.The compounding effect of tariffs comes at a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at near a 75-year low, and consumer demand for beef has grown.Beef cattle in a pasture at a ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCattle ranchers have had difficulties increasing the herd because of drought, which has diminished the amount of grasslands to feed their herds, and the higher costs in buying feed. Some imported fertilizers have faced double-digit tariffs, which have raised the cost of growing the crops (corn, soybeans) that are used in animal feed.Tariffs on essential items like steel and aluminum have also increased the cost of farm equipment (tractors, grain bins) and repairs.All of these added expenses carve out money from the coffers of ranchers and farmers that would be used for investing back into their operations.\"We're in one of the toughest cattle cycles in history,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"We have the smallest pipeline of future cattle and even with today's prices, ranchers can't speed up the process to rebuild the national herd, which will take time, grass, and rain,\" he said.Replacement heifers are down to a 20-year low.Ranchers say it takes years to see a return on buying heifers.\"The fundamentals are tight, the runway is long, and the slightest shock makes an already fragile rebuild even harder,\" Clement said. \"This is a foreign concept to many other industries where production can be ramped up or down in weeks,\" he added.One of the biggest headwinds curtailing investment is the current political environment.\"Producers start second-guessing whether to hold back heifers or take the money today because uncertainty adds risk to ranchers wanting to retain or purchase heifers to rebuild their herds,\" Clement said.President Trump added to frustration among ranchers when he announced as part of a deal with Argentina in October having the country export beef into the United States to help lower beef prices, which the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said would harm rural America and do nothing to help solve the issues in the domestic cattle market. The president's plan helped sink the price of cattle futures.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLive cattle futures trading chart year-to-date 2025 through November 13.\"We don't need Argentine beef because the U.S. already produces more high-quality beef than ever before,\" Clement said. \"The expanded Argentine quota entering our market, it would amount to less than half of one percent, about one extra hamburger per person, nowhere near enough to move the needle,\" he said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently acknowledged the dwindling herd numbers and announced a series of initiatives it hopes will encourage people to become cattlemen.The White House has become more focused on its affordability messaging in recent days after key GOP election losses around the country. The Trump administration announced trade deals on Thursday intended to help lower prices on some grocery staples not grown in the U.S., including from coffee and banana-producing countries Ecuador and Guatemala, and additional tariff reductions covering beef imports on Friday. \"It's politically easy to slap tariffs on foreign competitors to defend domestic producers but the consumer usually ends up paying the cost,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \"Demand then shrinks, they eat chicken instead and the domestic producers end up no better off,\" he said.While there are many ranchers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better economic conditions and incentives to grow their herds, Clement is investing in his ranch and is continuing to buy heifers to grow his operation.\"Cattle are a great long-term investment and ranching is a great life,\" he said.In addition to climate and feed costs, U.S. cattle ranchers are concerned about the possible return of the New World Screwworm. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins led the largest USDA trade mission to Mexico to discuss measures for combating NWS.The parasitic fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. This parasite was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966, but some cattle in Mexico have been found infected with the parasite and all Mexican beef imports have been shuttered.All of these supply chain challenges have added to the pressure on beef prices.\"We will adapt to market changes and New World Screwworm as ranchers have always done, by staying steady and calm in the face of all of the challenges that ranchers have always faced,\" Clement said.",

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Scratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light.

There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the \"Ford\" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. Unless you look closely.On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents.Ford's signature blue oval design can be seen in glass on the outside of its new world headquarters, in addition to numbers representing patents held by the company.FordFord declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.Here's a look inside the new world headquarters:Workers prepare to raise a large Ford Motor blue oval onto the company's new headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "People walk past a Prada storefront located in a modern shopping complex on January 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesChinese shoppers are returning to luxury. Top executives from Prada, Coach, EssilorLuxottica and Value Retail told CNBC they're seeing demand in China stabilize after months of weakness, even as the broader luxury sector continues to report softer spending among Chinese consumers at home and overseas.China was on track to become the world's largest luxury market during the coronavirus pandemic, but the sector has slowed sharply since then. High youth unemployment, a prolonged property downturn and weaker household confidence have weighed on discretionary purchases, particularly among middle-income shoppers.Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed at the JPMorgan Global Luxury and Brands Conference in Paris, France, executives said they are beginning to see a change in spending patterns. Andrea Bonini, chief financial officer of Prada Group, said the company is \"cautiously optimistic.\"\"We do see things stabilizing, indeed,\" Bonini told CNBC, adding that \"the structural trends in this industry are still there, and are still there in China as well.\"Prada's CFO said a more \"normalized\" backdrop may only emerge in 2026 after the sharp swings that followed the pandemic.watch nowCoach is also seeing strong momentum. CEO and brand president Todd Khan told CNBC: \"We had a fabulous quarter. Our China business grew by 20%,\" a trend he said has held for several quarters. Coach's positioning has helped attract a more cautious consumer, he said, adding: \"Our sweet spot in China, particularly if the consumer is more cautious, really resonates.\"The company is deepening its on-the-ground presence, with 25 years in the market, co-design studios in China, and expansion in regional hubs such as Wuhan. Coach has also been somewhat insulated from U.S. tariff exposure.\"So, 40% of our growth is international. So, for international, those U.S. tariffs that you're referencing have no impact,\" Khan said.Signs of growthRecent earnings support that view. UBS research shows Burberry's Greater China sales rose 3% last quarter, beating expectations for flat growth, while Richemont said sales to Chinese customers were \"almost flat\" — a sharp improvement from earlier double-digit declines. UBS added that Richemont delivered 10% APAC growth and saw improving momentum into year-end.LVMH, for its part, has pointed to early signs of stabilization. Last month, the luxury giant reported 1% growth in the third quarter — its first quarterly increase this year — with CFO Cécile Cabanis telling analysts that \"mainland China turned positive in Q3,\" according to Reuters.watch nowStill, analysts have warned against assuming a full rebound.Chiara Battistini, JPMorgan's head of European luxury, told CNBC it is \"early to call it a turnaround and a complete inflection,\" noting that the apparent improvement came against \"a particularly easy\" comparison base. Some of the uplift, she said, reflected spending being repatriated back into mainland China rather than a broad-based acceleration.The overall picture across the \"total Chinese consumer\" in Asia remained \"more mixed,\" Battistini said, with China's macro backdrop still \"quite complex.\"Brands race to localiseGlobal brands are being pushed to localize far more aggressively as competition from Chinese labels intensifies. As CNBC's Evelyn Cheng reported a few weeks ago, many are increasing China-focused marketing — in some cases to more than 40% of revenue, according to WPIC's Jacob Cooke — while speeding up product cycles and tailoring designs using local consumer data. The rise of social media platforms Xiaohongshu and Douyin has also forced companies to rethink content and product strategy.Read moreThe change is slowly trickling down to retailers and big luxury companies that are seeing modest growth from the region. Outlet operator Value Retail has seen solid traction. Chairman Scott Malkin said the company's China properties \"are going very well right now,\" noting that global brands had encouraged the company to expand into China to ensure the \"correct presentation of authentic surplus.\"Malkin said outlets continue to attract the \"aspirational buyer who will become a full-price customer again in a different moment.\"The same holds true for eyewear group EssilorLuxottica, that is reporting broad-based growth too. CFO Stefano Grassi said: \"We were double digit in North America, double digits in Europe, and double digits in Asia.\"\"We see consumer not trading down. We see consumers attracted by product innovation,\" Grassi said. Luxury bosses agree China is stabilizing, but not yet rebounding.watch nowWith brands reshaping strategy and analysts urging caution, the recovery remains a slow grind. Still, as Prada's Bonini said, the \"structural trends\" powering Chinese luxury haven't gone away — they're just taking longer to re-emerge.— CNBC's Christopher Kang contributed to this report.",

    "body": "When a couple welcomes a child to their family, many may want one parent to stay home with the new addition, rather than returning to work. But that decision comes with a number of tradeoffs. Having one parent stay home may help the family save money on child care, which can cost more than college tuition in more than half of states, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. However, it could negatively impact that parent's salary prospects or career growth if they later decide to return to work.Another factor to consider is if the working parent's income is enough to support the entire family. In Hawaii, a working parent needs to earn at least $102,773 a year to support themself, a non-working partner and a child, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis of Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator data. The analysis includes estimates for basic living expenses, including rent, groceries and health care. It doesn't account for discretionary costs like travel and entertainment, but includes cost estimates for basic apparel, household supplies and personal care products. In Hawaii, the working parent needs to earn the most of any state to support a three-person household, the analysis found. However, if both parents work, the family needs to earn at least $115,814 a year to afford basic living expenses including child care, SmartAsset found. The median household income in Hawaii is just over $98,000, according to Census Bureau data. Here's how much one parent needs to earn so the other can stay home in every U.S. state.Hidden costs of being a stay-at-home parentLeaving the workforce for a few years can have long-term effects on a parent's career, Emily Green, head of wealth management for Ellevest, previously told CNBC Make It. This often affects more women than men since women represent 82% of stay-at-home parents, according to Pew Research.\"In households where there's a little more financial wiggle room, women often don't think about what they may give up in the long term —  say in 5-10 years — by leaving their jobs now,\" Green said.Leaving the workforce for an extended period of time could mean missing out on steady salary increases, adding gaps to your resume that could make it harder to secure future job opportunities and falling behind on long-term career goals, Green said. Those tradeoffs may be worth it to some parents and necessary for others who don't have other viable child-care options. \"I have seen many women leave their jobs because their salaries don't cover the cost of child care,\" Green said. \"In some households, that math means a career break is inescapable.\"Regardless, they are important factors to consider when thinking about your family's financial situation. Families may want to work with a financial professional to see how various scenarios may impact their long-term goals. Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Fans watch game six of the NBA playoffs during a watch party at a bar on May 31, 2025 in New York City. David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesA version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman, which brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.As prediction market trading volume booms, Truist analysts say there could be an unlikely source behind the surge. Analyst Barry Jonas wrote this week that 18- to 20-year-olds, who are too young to gamble legally in most states, could be contributing significantly to the growth of prediction markets.Specifically, data from HoldCrunch, founded by a former FanDuel executive, shows prediction platform Kalshi is taking more trades on college football than on NFL and NBA. While non-college students could still wager on college results, of course, the trend could offer a clue into the demographics of prediction platform users. HoldCrunch analyzes the data on an \"OSB-equivalent handle\" rather than on volumes alone.   During the week ended Jan. 4, Kalshi's college football handle hit its highest percentage of total at 32%, the prediction platform said. The NFL accounted for 24% of total wagers, and the NBA represented 22%. The tide has been shifting in that direction since October, according to Kalshi.  Prediction markets — in which users can bet on the outcomes of events in everything from politics and world news to pop culture and sports — have skyrocketed in popularity with the help of platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. They're quickly filling a gap in the market in states where online sports betting is not legal. And in states where it is legal, online sporting betting is often limited to those 21 years or older. Kalshi and Polymarket are open to anyone 18 or older, with some state-by-state exceptions for sports and other certain trades. \"It's clear that these new offerings are having an impact on sports bettor behavior,\" Jonas wrote. NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote this week to the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, which regulates prediction markets, asking the agency to remove college sports from options to trade until more safeguards are in place. Juice Reel, an app that allows sports gamblers to track wagers and provides analysis of wagering and trading activity, found higher uptake of prediction markets in states where sports betting isn't legal. According to Juice Reel, 9% of its California customers have connected prediction accounts, the most of any other state. Just over 6% of Juice Reel's Texas customers have linked prediction market accounts. Neither California nor Texas offers legal, licensed sports betting.  Curiously, New York, which has legal online sports betting, ranks second on Juice Reel in customers who have connected prediction accounts (6.8%), perhaps because of the concentration of financial traders accustomed to trading futures, options and other volatile financial derivatives. Truist's analysts hypothesize 18- to 20-year-olds could be fueling the predictions action in the state, too. Residents of both New York and California demonstrate a notable propensity for gambling outside the bounds of regulated sportsbooks. New York charges a tax of 51% on sportsbooks, but not on sweeps, daily fantasy, bookie accounts and offshore sportsbooks. And those alternate platforms get 40% of the overall handle, or money wagered, from the Juice Reel customers.In part, that's because gamblers who really know what they're doing can't bet big on platforms like DraftKings or FanDuel. \"Some of the biggest and best bettors are going to prediction markets because they're limited to smaller bets by the sportsbooks,\" Juice Reel's founder Ricky Gold told CNBC. Fully 70% of the bets tracked by Juice Reel are in regulated sportsbooks, but they account for only 38% of the handle. By contrast, predictions account for only 1% of the number of bets, but 13% of the handle.  \"Prediction markets amplify bettor skill and variance,\" Truist's Jonas concluded, adding they \"show substantially larger downside for low-wallet users and substantially higher upside for high-wallet users.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship. ",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaks during an interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Oct. 30, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Thursday the giant Wall Street investment bank is actively exploring opportunities in prediction markets, signaling growing institutional interest in a corner of finance that has gained increased traction among traders.\"The prediction markets are also super interesting,\" Solomon said on Goldman's fourth-quarter earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. \"I personally met with the two big prediction companies and their leadership in the last two weeks and spent a couple of hours with each to learn more about that. We have a team of people here that are spending time with them and are looking at it.\"Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket allow investors to trade contracts tied to the outcome of world events, ranging from elections and economic data releases to policy decisions. Goldman's interest comes as prediction markets gain visibility amid debates over market transparency and regulatory boundaries.Some platforms operate under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a distinction that Solomon said makes the products look increasingly similar to traditional financial instruments.\"When you think about some of these activities, particularly when you look at some of the ones that are CFTC regulated, they look like derivative contract activities,\" said the 63-year old CEO who's led Goldman since 2018. \"So I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business.\"Still, Solomon struck a note of caution on timing, pushing back on expectations that Wall Street's embrace of prediction markets will be rapid.\"I think there's a lot of reason to be excited and interested in these things,\" he said. \"But the pace of change might not be as quick and as immediate as some of the pundits are talking about. But I think they're important, real. And we're spending a lot of time.\"",

The deal closes on or about Jan. 19.\"It's our view that ethereum, which is a smart contract platform, is the future of finance, where digitalization of not only dollars but stocks and equities [are] going to take place,\" Bitmine Chairman Tom Lee said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"Over time, that really blurs what is a service versus what's digital money, and that's where a collaboration and investment into Beast Industries makes sense.\"Alongside Lee, who also serves as head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, key investors in Bitmine include ARK's Cathie Wood, Bill Miller III and Galaxy Digital.\"I think it's part of the sort of evolution of digital platforms and money, and I think it's really uniting the No. 1 creator in the world with the biggest ethereum platform in the world,\" Lee added.Shares of Bitmine were up more than 1% premarket Thursday after the announcement. The stock has already soared more than 20% since New Year's, far surpassing the 1% gain in the S&P 500.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBMNR, year-to-dateAddressing the broader cryptocurrency universe, Lee is optimistic on both bitcoin and ethereum, anticipating the former will reach a new all-time high in 2026. He's even more bullish on ethereum,  expecting its performance to outpace bitcoin this year. Lee's bullishness comes as the Senate Agriculture and Banking committees are expected to hold hearings this month on a crypto market structure bill that offers guardrails for the industry.\"Crypto really got hurt [in] October last year, so it is our view that we're going to have a pretty big recovery as we put more time between that moment,\" Lee said.",

Last week, five Republican senators joined with Democrats to advance the resolution — a stunning defeat for Trump after he ordered a strike that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.In the days since, the White House engaged in a furious lobbying effort to block the measure.

    "body": "TSMC offices in San Jose, California, on April 18, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a 35% increase in fourth-quarter profit, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips remained strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 1.046 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($33.73 billion), vs. NT$1.034 trillion expectedNet income: NT$505.74 billion, vs. NT$478.37 billion expectedThe world's largest contract chipmaker has now posted year-over-year profit growth for eight consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, TSMC's revenue in the December quarter rose by 20.5% from a year ago to surpass NT$1 trillion, also beating forecasts.In an earnings call, TSMC executives guided revenue for the current quarter to hit between $34.6 billion and $35.8 billion, up 4% sequentially, or up 38% year-over-year at the midpoint. \"We expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading edge process technologies,\" said TSMC's Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang during an earnings call, adding that the company's profit margins have been increasing. TSMC, Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, has benefited greatly from the proliferation of artificial intelligence, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and AMD. Advanced chips The company's high-performance computing division, which includes artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the October-December quarter at 55%. Demand from smartphones made up 32% of sales.TSMC said advanced chips measuring 7-nanometer or smaller made up 77% of total wafer revenue during the quarter. For full-year 2025, those chips made up 74% of revenue, up from 69% in 2024.In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes indicate more compact transistor designs, allowing faster processing speeds and greater energy efficiency. The company is looking to further ramp up its cutting-edge 2 nm offerings this year, after rolling out mass production last quarter. With TSMC further leaning into its advanced products, it said that its capital expenditure was expected to reach between $52 billion and $56 billion in 2026, as compared to $40.9 billion in 2025. \"The demand for AI remains very strong, driving overall chip demand across the entire server industry,\" Counterpoint Research senior analyst Jake Lai told CNBC, predicting that 2026 will be another \"breakout year\" for AI server demand. \"With TSMC's ongoing 2nm capacity expansion and new production contributing to revenue, along with continuous expansion of advanced packaging... TSMC is expected to maintain strong performance in 2026,\" Lai said. However, he added that chip demand tied to consumer electronics such as smartphones and PCs could be affected by the ongoing memory shortage and price hikes.During the earnings call on Thursday, TSMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei acknowledged the memory shortage but argued that TSMC is focused on high-end smartphones, which are less sensitive to the memory prices. However, Wei flagged global tariff policies as a potential risk factor headed into 2026. Global expansion TSMC has been expanding globally in recent years, with major projects underway in Japan, Europe, and Arizona, where it is accelerating capacity expansion.Chief Executive C.C. Wei said Thursday that the company recently purchased additional land in Arizona to support new facilities. \"We are going to expand many fabs over there, and this gigafab cluster can help us to improve the productivity, to lower the cost and to serve our customers in the U.S. better,\" he added. While these expansions could help lessen the impact of global tariffs in markets such as the U.S., the company has also warned that overseas plants will operate at diluted margins compared to those in Taiwan.

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "People walk past Morgan Stanley global headquarters in Manhattan on March 20, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations on the back of strong revenue from wealth management. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:Earnings per share: $2.68 vs. $2.44 expected Revenue: $17.89 billion vs. $17.77 billion expectedFourth-quarter net income rose to $4.40 billion, or $2.68 per share, from $3.71 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year ago. Revenue increased to $17.89 billion from $16.22 billion a year ago.The bank stock jumped about 6% on Thursday following the report. The wealth management unit posted $8.4 billion in net revenue in the most recent quarter, up from $7.5 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the division generated a record $31.8 billion in net revenue. Total client assets in the wealth and investment management business climbed to $9.3 trillion, fueled by more than $350 billion in net new assets.\"Morgan Stanley delivered outstanding performance in 2025,\" Ted Pick, the bank's CEO and chairman, said in a statement. \"Our performance reflects multi-year investments which have contributed to growth and momentum across the Integrated Firm.\"Investment banking was also a standout for the firm. Net revenue for the segment jumped 47% to $2.41 billion from $1.64 billion a year earlier, driven by stronger advisory fees as completed M&A activity increased across all regions.The firm bought back $1.5 billion of its stock during the quarter and $4.6 billion over the full year under its share repurchase program.Morgan Stanley shares have gained more than 43% over the past 12 months.Other banks have mostly posted solid results. JPMorgan Chase topped expectations for fourth-quarter results on strong equities and fixed income trading revenue. Wells Fargo posted weaker-than-expected revenue, while Bank of America and Citigroup beat consensus estimates.",

    "body": "U.S. Treasury yields gained Thursday after the latest jobless claims data pointed to an improving labor market. Investors also assessed ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 1 basis points at 4.154%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury advanced more than 4 basis points to 3.556%. Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury yield was 1 basis point lower at 4.784%. One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.The latest weekly jobless claims data pointed to a solid jobs market, which could lower expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Initial claims for the week ending Jan. 10 came in at 198,000, lower than the 215,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Odds of an interest rate cut coming early in April fell from the day prior, to 30.2% from 34.6%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Markets were last pricing in two quarter point cuts in 2026. Geopolitical risks have dominated headlines this week and investors are watching as Trump insists on taking ownership of Greenland — an autonomous region within the Kingdom of Denmark — claiming it's central to U.S. national security. A White House meeting between officials from Greenland, Denmark, and the U.S. took place on Wednesday but a Danish official said it ended with \"fundamental disagreement\" over ownership of the Island. Meanwhile, tensions between the U.S. and Iran have also been weighing on investors amid speculation that the U.S. could launch a military strike in response to Iran's crackdown on widespread protests. However, Trump signaled Wednesday that he might hold off on attacking, saying: \"We've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping… and there's no plan for executions.\"An ongoing criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is also raising concerns about the Fed's independence amid White House intimidation and whether it can remain unburdened by political influence on monetary policy. Global central bankers have defended Powell, saying that the independence of central banks \"is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he arrives to address House Republicans at their annual issues conference retreat, at the Kennedy Center, renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by the Trump-appointed board of directors, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 6, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are down in the polls with less than 10 months until the midterm elections. Now, Trump is giving the economic populism of the left a try. Last week, Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest at 10%, unveiled plans to bar large private-equity funds from buying up housing and said he would bar defense companies from issuing dividends or stock buybacks. These moves check off many policy wishes of the populist progressive left and borrow from political opponents like former Vice President Kamala Harris.It comes as Trump, who strode into a second term on a pledge to lower costs, finds himself underwater on the economy. A recent CBS News poll found that only 39% of voters approved of his performance on the issue, while 61% disapproved, one of his worst polls since retaking the presidency. That's a big problem for Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who could lose their slim majorities in both the House and the Senate in the November elections. Democrats are pounding the administration with an election-year message centered on affordability, arguing that the president and his allies have failed to bring down costs for everyday Americans. This line of attack on the cost of goods worked well for Democrats in gubernatorial races in late 2025.Republicans hold a razor-thin 218-213 vote majority in the House and a 53-47 seat majority in the Senate. A growing number of Republicans in the House have decided to retire at the end of this term, and Trump has warned that if Democrats take the House, \"they'll find a reason to impeach me.\"Trump's moves appear aimed at addressing voters' concerns around affordability — in the Truth Social post where he announced the credit card interest cap, the president wrote \"AFFORDABILITY!\" But not all Republicans on Capitol Hill are convinced that Trump's populist shift represents a life raft as Democrats take a consistent lead in generic congressional ballot polling.\"Self-control, clear messaging, clear priorities would be helpful,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who will retire at the end of this term, in an interview with CNBC. \"He actually sounds more and more like a Democrat, if you think about it.\"  Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe\"When you talk about limiting businesses buying houses, limiting the salaries of corporate heads, I mean, that's much more like a Democrat messaging to me,\" Bacon said. Other Republicans were even more dismissive of the effort. One longtime House Republican, granted anonymity to discuss Trump's proposals candidly, said, \"The kind of stuff we're talking about right now ... is called hiding from your record.\"The Trump administration is defending the president's populist shift amid the complaints from some in the GOP.\"President Trump was given a resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, D.C.'s obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \"The Trump administration is turning the page on Joe Biden's economic disaster by implementing traditional free market policies that do work – like deregulation and tax cuts – while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\"But even top House and Senate Republicans have not exactly embraced Trump's latest moves to lower costs for Americans, and appear to be coalescing around the message that Trump is an \"ideas guy.\" Trump in the past has thrown a myriad of policy proposals at the wall to see what will stick, forcing his Republican allies to quickly adjust their priorities. \"The president is the ideas guy, and what he's doggedly determined to do, and laser-focused upon doing, is the same thing that we are, and that is reducing the cost of living,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference on Tuesday when asked about the credit card interest cap proposal. \"I wouldn't get too spun up about ideas that are out of the box that are proposed or suggested,\" Johnson added.Republicans have largely echoed banks in warning against a 10% cap on credit card interest, arguing such a cap could result in fewer people being offered credit and depress spending. Trump's credit card interest cap proposal came in a Truth Social post, hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted about it. Sanders, the former presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020, has long pushed a populist economic agenda and proposed a credit card interest cap in 2019. He sponsored a bill with Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri with a populist streak, to impose the cap. \"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder,\" Sanders wrote. \"Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards … Unacceptable.\"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to the crowd at U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) campaign rally in the Bronx borough of New York City, U.S., June 22, 2024. Joy Malone | ReutersHours later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was \"calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%.\"Trump's housing proposal, too, is similar to a proposal from former Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2024, during her presidential campaign, Harris urged Congress to pass a bill that would have curtailed investors from buying large numbers of single-family rental homes. Large private equity firms currently own less than five percent of single-family rental homes. \"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post announcing the policy. It's unclear whether Trump's populist turn will end up providing any cover for Republicans, who are planning to crisscross the country selling voters on their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law that cut taxes and advanced other policy items sought by Trump.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has become a frequent foil of the Trump administration after leading the charge to compel the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said it's unclear if the ideas will even be popular. \"Its populist economics is what it is,\" Massie said in an interview. \"It may very well be popular, I mean, there are going to be some downsides to it as well. We'll see how it plays out and whether he can actually pull it off.\" Pollsters say Trump is looking for a \"game changer\" to change voters' minds on the economy. \"He needs to convince people that things are going to be better economically in a short period of time and that's what all of these moves, I think, are intended to do,\" said Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling. \"It might tighten, and the bottom might come out, and the other side could run away with it.\"How Trump pulls it off remains to be seen. Many of the proposals would likely require congressional authorization. To that end, Trump appears to be reaching out to Democrats — including those he has repeatedly maligned.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Trump called her on Monday after she gave a speech at the National Press Club, where she laid out a case for a Democratic victory in 2026 by arguing that \"when the choice is between 'make the rich richer' and 'help everybody else,' winning elections is about choosing 'everybody else.\"\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it,\" Warren said in a statement after the president's call. \"I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who represents Silicon Valley and is an oft-discussed potential presidential candidate in 2028, welcomed the president in an interview with CNBC.\"Well, I'm glad Trump is proposing populist policies. I support the idea that we should ban private equity from buying up single-family homes; that was my bill,\" Khanna said. \"If he wants to propose policies that are progressive or populist that are going to help Americans, I'll vote for them.\" That's not to say all leading Democrats are ready to help Trump lower prices and salvage the midterms for Republicans. \"I don't know why we would take what he says seriously, because it's his policies that are jacking up prices,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, during a press conference this week. \"Unless he reverses his policies, these prices are going to keep on increasing.\" Then, there's the possibility that Trump is using his slew of economic proposals to drive the news cycle away from his weak points. The president has recently come under immense scrutiny for his use of the military after the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, his appearances in the Epstein files and his aggressive deportation agenda.\"Quite frankly, he's the master of distraction. In the middle of something, he'll make a statement or then look over to something else,\" said Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump's Secretary of the Interior in his first term. ",

Cost overruns have been a point of contention between the Fed and the White House, with the latest developments pointing to a potential criminal prosecution of Powell.While Goolsbee said he wasn't commenting directly on the legal issues, he expressed support for Powell's statement Sunday that the questions over the construction project could be seen as a pretext toward President Donald Trump getting his way on interest rates.\"I agree with it, with his argument that if you're investigating as a pretext because you disagree with the rate decisions, that's a mess. We should not be in that place,\" he said.Trump has been relentless in his biting, often-personal criticism of the Powell Fed. He repeatedly has called for much lower interest rates and has nicknamed Powell \"Too Late\" even though the Fed has cut its benchmark rate three times since September 2025.Powell's term as chair ends in May, though he could stay on as a governor until 2028.Like other Fed officials, Goolsbee said the independence of the Fed is critical for it to achieve its goals.\"I know that there have been countries that had criminal investigations of their central banks, but those countries are Zimbabwe and Russia and Turkey and a bunch of places that you would not characterize as advanced economies,\" he said.Before taking his position at the Chicago Fed in December 2022, Goolsbee had a long history of involvement in Democratic politics.He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama and served as an advisor during Joe Biden's campaign in 2020. However, he said Thursday that once \"you've become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the elections business.\"Goolsbee has called Powell a \"first-ballot Hall of Famer\" as a Fed chair for bringing down inflation without causing a recession.watch now",

    "body": "Amazon package and Saks Fifth Avenue bag.Getty ImagesAmazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store \"burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year\" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \"Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.\"As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. Amazon wrote that it \"hopes\" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may \"seek more drastic remedies\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in Grubhub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. Correction: An earlier headline on this article incorrectly quoted the Amazon filing. watch now",

    "body": "The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday it will pause issuing immigrant visas to citizens of 75 countries over concerns that they may rely on public assistance in the future.In a post on X, the U.S. government said immigrants from the list of countries \"take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.\" The list, which includes U.S. allies and adversaries, alongside several top destinations for American travelers, was later posted on U.S. State Department's website. The countries, divided by region, include: The Americas- Antigua and Barbuda- Bahamas - Barbados - Belize - Brazil - Colombia - Cuba - Dominica - Grenada - Guatemala - Haiti - Jamaica - Nicaragua - St. Kitts and Nevis - St. Lucia - St. Vincent and the Grenadines - UruguayEurope- Albania - Belarus - Bosnia and Herzegovina - Kosovo - Moldova - Montenegro - North MacedoniaAsia-Pacific- Afghanistan - Armenia - Azerbaijan - Bangladesh - Bhutan - Cambodia- Fiji - Georgia - Iran - Iraq - Jordan - Kazakhstan - Kuwait - Kyrgyzstan - Laos - Lebanon - Mongolia - Myanmar - Nepal - Pakistan - Russia - Syria - Thailand - Uzbekistan- YemenAfrica- Algeria - Cameroon - Cape Verde - Côte d'Ivoire - Democratic Republic of the Congo - Egypt - Eritrea - Ethiopia - Ghana - Guinea - Liberia - Libya - Morocco - Nigeria - Republic of the Congo - Rwanda - Senegal - Sierra Leone - Somalia - South Sudan - Sudan - Tanzania - The Gambia - Togo - Tunisia - UgandaThe freeze, which is set to begin Jan. 21, does not affect tourist visas. It will remain in effect \"until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,\" according to the U.S. State Department's website.  This latest announcement follows a string of immigration and travel visa restrictions from the Trump Administration, including the pausing of diversity visas in late December. Diversity visas allowed a maximum of 55,000 immigrants from countries with low U.S. immigration rates to enter the United States each year. Current immigration visas The policy does not affect current immigration visas. However, the U.S. government has previously signaled it's reviewing immigration visas granted under the Biden Administration. Joseph Edlow, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a post on X in November, said he's \"directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\" at the direction of President Donald Trump.He added that \"the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration's reckless resettlement policies.\"Read moreImmigrant visa holders who are granted permanent resident cards, commonly known as \"Green Cards,\" are eligible for certain types of public assistance, but there is a five-year waiting period after obtaining the status to receive several benefits, including Medicaid, Medicare and the SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program, according to the non-partisan, not-for-profit organization USAFacts.The State Department on Monday announced it revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, including tourists who overstayed their visa periods, as well as some 8,000 student and 2,500 specialized worker visa holders for criminal offenses ranging from driving under the influence to theft.",

    "body": "watch nowOil prices fell more than 4% on Thursday, after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump eased market speculation that an American strike on Iran could be imminent. Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, lost 4.15%, or $2.76, to close at $63.76 a barrel. Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.83, or 4.56%, to settle at $59.19 a barrel.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had been informed by \"very important sources\" in Iran that \"the killing has stopped.\"\"There's no plans for executions, I've been told that on good authority,\" he said, adding that the White House would watch how the situation unfolds. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed after mass unrest in Iran was met with a violent crackdown by the Islamic Republic's security forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if civilians are killed or executed by the state. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude priceOil prices jumped on Tuesday after Trump canceled meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that \"help is on its way,\" and extended gains on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a U.S. strike on the country was looming. Those fears were fueled by a report from news agency Reuters that some personnel had been directed to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening. The BBC also reported that some British personnel were being moved out of the base. On Tuesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory to American citizens to leave Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey. \"Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help,\" the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran said. \"If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items.\"In a note on Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said Trump's comments about the killing in Iran stopping had been taken by markets as \"a signal that the U.S. might hold off on a potential military response.\"\"[But] there's clearly lingering caution, not least given the unexpected timing of U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025,\" he noted. \"Brent crude is still clearly above its lows below $60/bbl last week, but Trump's comments had a clear impact.\"\"Bear in mind as well that Iran is a more significant oil producer than Venezuela, producing 4% of the world's total in 2023, so developments there have the potential for wider spillovers in the oil market,\" Reid added.",

Trump, however, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\" The U.S., Denmark and Greenland agreed to establish a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island, although, as had been widely expected, the three countries were unable to find a diplomatic resolution to defuse tensions.(L/R) Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak during a news conference at the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2026.Oliver Contreras | Afp | Getty ImagesBefore the meeting, Denmark announced plans on Wednesday to beef up its military presence in and around Greenland, saying the exercise activities could include guarding national infrastructure, deploying fighter aircraft and conducting naval operations.

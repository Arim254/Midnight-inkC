    "body": "Former White House national security adviser John Bolton arrives at U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, to surrender and face an initial appearance on charges of mishandled classified information, in Greenbelt, Maryland, U.S., October 17, 2025.Leah Millis | ReutersJohn Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security advisor, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of mishandling classified information, multiple news outlets reported.Bolton, 76, made his initial appearance in federal court in Maryland one day after being indicted by a grand jury, becoming the latest Trump foe to face criminal charges.Bolton is charged with 18 counts of possession and retention of materials related to national defense.He faces up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted, though federal sentencing guidelines would likely recommend a much less severe punishment.The 26-page indictment alleges Bolton shared classified information with two relatives while he was Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019. Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said that the former national security advisor did not share or store any information unlawfully.\"The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday.Bolton in his own statement said he was being targeted because of his opposition to Trump.The charges, he said, are about Trump's \"intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "Michelle Bowman, vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve, during the Federal Reserve Board Community Bank Conference in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. Eric Lee | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRegulators are doing away with controversial rules that required banks to plan for losses in the event of climate-related events, according to an announcement Thursday.A joint release from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve said they no longer believe the requirements are necessary as they are redundant with other provisions banks make to plan for emergencies and unusual events.\"The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities,\" a joint release from the three regulators said.Fed Governor Michael Barr, the former vice chair for supervision, issued a statement disagreeing with the move.\"Rescinding the principles is shortsighted and will make the financial system riskier even as climate-related financial risks grow,\" Barr said in a statement.Mission creepTrump administration officials have criticized the Fed for falling prey to mission creep, or exceeding the scope of its mandates for monetary policy and bank supervision. The climate change provisions, established in October 2023, were one point of criticism.Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that climate is not a direct Fed issue. The rules required banks, as part of routine testing, to list potential losses they might suffer from climate-related issues.Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee who succeeded Barr as the Fed banking supervisor, praised the move rescinding the rules as part of an attempt at \"refocusing the supervisory process on material financial risk.\"\"Rescission of the climate principles is an important step in this process,\" Bowman said. She criticized the climate rules, saying \"the effect of this guidance was to create confusion about supervisory expectations and increase compliance cost and burden without a commensurate improvement to the safety and soundness of financial institutions or to the financial stability of the United States.\"While acknowledging the risks that climate change poses, Bowman said the Fed's mission does \"not extend to climate policymaking.\"",

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) (L) brief members of the press during a news conference on the government shutdown at the U.S. Capitol on October 16, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesCapitol Hill remains locked in a stalemate as the government shutdown trudges into its third week — and Democrats say their lack of trust in President Donald Trump is a major obstacle to negotiations.In past legislative disputes, bipartisan coalitions known as \"gangs\" have formed to break the logjams. The groups have helped lay the early framework for major deals before getting buy-in from leadership and other lawmakers.In the current funding lapse — which is already longer than most previous government shutdowns — those gangs are nowhere to be found.\"What good is an agreement by a gang of four or eight or 12, when the president of the United States regards himself as his own law and disregards the norms and rules?\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told CNBC.There have been some bipartisan talks around Democrats' key demand: an extension of enhanced premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, which are set to expire at year's end.But no specific group has convened to hash out those details, or more broadly negotiate an end to the shutdown.Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who supports extending the tax credits, said he's had conversations with multiple Democratic senators, but no set group has formed.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., holds up the continuing resolution to fund the government during a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., on the shutdown in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\"What's different about this is I don't sense any coalescing,\" Hawley said. \"There doesn't seem to be any sort of momentum around people saying, like, 'OK, really, we need to make a deal.'\"Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have maintained that no negotiations can happen until the government has reopened. They need support from around eight Senate Democrats to pass a stopgap bill that will temporarily resume federal funding at current levels.Thune told MSNBC on Wednesday that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for opening the government.But Democrats have expressed strong doubts about any handshake deal with Republicans.\"We need an ironclad path forward that decisively addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\"They can't be trusted on a wing and a prayer,\" Jeffries said.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

A bipartisan immigration reform proposal introduced last year, for instance, collapsed after Trump publicly opposed it.Some Democrats are now calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.\"They seem to follow his lead on everything,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said of his GOP colleagues on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday.\"That's the way this ends,\" Kelly said.Further eroding trust is the Trump administration's willingness to cancel billions of dollars in funding approved by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters.\"There's been a loss of trust between Senate Democrats and the Administration and the House because of what's happened over the last six to nine months in terms of respecting bipartisan spending bills that were signed into law last year,\" Coons said.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of avoiding negotiations in order to appease progressives in his party, who excoriated him after he previously voted to fund the government in March.\"I think he's afraid to reach some sort of deal like we typically do in these circumstances, because he'll be attacked by his progressive, radical base,\" Cornyn said of Schumer.Schumer was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" that helped pass a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate in 2013.Hawley said that Democrats were comfortable keeping the standoff going.\"I just think that folks seem to be pretty content, particularly Democrats, with leaving the government shut down,\" he said.Democrats have a reason to feel secure, at least for now: Multiple polls show more Americans are blaming Republicans for the shutdown.The latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that 53% of respondents would blame Trump, congressional Republicans or both if the shutdown caused significant economic harm, versus 37% who would blame Democrats.The survey, which polled 1,000 adults nationwide from Oct. 8-12, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1%.",

The shutdown started Oct. 1 as Congress failed to pass a funding bill.Speaking on an earnings call on Thursday, Kirby said the shutdown so far hasn't impacted the carrier's business.\"I think that at least for the first couple of weeks, people thought it was going to get resolved, so they just kind of continued business as usual,\" he said. \"But as time goes on, as people read headlines and say, 'it's not going to get resolved soon.'

    "body": "Some of Europe's major private markets firms sold off on Friday as concerns over lending standards in U.S. markets swept across the Atlantic.London-listed ICG fell about 6%, while CVC Capital Partners, which is headquartered in Jersey, had lost about 5.4% by the afternoon. Swiss private markets firm Partners Group fell 4%, as Sweden's EQT was down 4%.The moves follow a widespread sell-off among U.S. regional banks this week, as fears grow over risky lending practices potentially spilling over from the private credit market into the broader banking space.ICG manages more than $30 billion in private debt assets, about 25% of its total asstes under management as of late June. Partners Group manages $38 billion in private credit and CVC's private credit business, which focuses on direct lending opportunities, manages about 17 billion euros ($19.9 billion).Credit quality has come into sharper focus in recent weeks following U.S. car parts maker First Brands' implosion and the subprime auto lender Tricolor's bankruptcy. Investment bank Jefferies, which had exposure to First Brands, closed down 11% on Thursday before rebounding Friday.While First Brands' collapse stemmed mainly from its complex borrowing arrangements within the supply-chain financing and invoice receivables space, the debacle has spotlighted broader concerns over increased leverage and potentially lax credit standards.J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said more potential stress could lay hidden within the credit system. \"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" said Dimon during J.P. Morgan's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. \"Everybody should be forewarned on this.\"watch nowIn an exclusive interview with CNBC, Joachim Nagel, president of Germany's Bundesbank and ECB governing council member, warned this week of \"spillovers\" from the private credit market, calling it a \"regulatory risk.\"\"I'm concerned when it comes to private credit, private lending,\" Nagel told CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington on Wednesday.\"This market is really big now — as far as I know it's more than $1 trillion, and we know there are some spillovers from the less-regulated market participants to the more regulated market participants. We as regulators, we have to take a close look at it.\"Meanwhile, Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said the group is now keeping closer tabs on non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly in the private credit space.\"This leverage is probably resilient, but of course, we are watching underwriting standards very closely,\" Adrian told CNBC's Tso.watch now",

    "body": "A shopper walks past shelves of cooking oil for sale at a supermarket in Beijing on October 15, 2025. Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs will cost global businesses upward of $1.2 trillion in 2025, with most of the cost being passed onto consumers, according to a new analysis from S&P Global.In a white paper released Thursday, the firm said its estimate of additional expenses for companies is probably conservative. The price tag comes from information provided by some 15,000 sell-side analysts across 9,000 companies who contribute to S&P and its proprietary research indexes.\"The sources of this trillion-dollar squeeze are broad. Tariffs and trade barriers act as taxes on supply chains and divert cash to governments; logistics delays and freight costs compound the effect,\" author Daniel Sandberg said in the report. \"Collectively, these forces represent a systemic transfer of wealth from corporate profits to workers, suppliers, governments, and infrastructure investors.\"Trump in April slapped 10% tariffs on all goods entering the U.S. and listed individual \"reciprocal\" tariffs for dozens of other countries. Since then, the White House has entered a series of negotiations and agreements while also adding duties on a variety of individual items such as kitchen cabinets, autos and timber.While administration officials have insisted that exporters will be forced to bear the greater share of the levies, the S&P analysis suggests that is only partly true.In fact, the firm says that just one-third will be borne by companies, with the rest falling on the shoulders of consumers, under conservative estimates. The figures incorporated a $907 billion hit to covered companies with the remainder to uncovered firms as well as private equity and venture capital.\"With real output declining, consumers are paying more for less, suggesting that this two-thirds share represents a lower bound on their true burden,\" said Sandberg, who wrote the report along with Drew Bowers, a senior quantitative analyst at S&P Global.Political and policy stakesThe size of the tariff hit and the burden of the costs are critical both for the White House looking to sell the duties as essential to restoring a fair trade balance, and to policymakers at the Federal Reserve looking to calibrate the proper balance for monetary policy.\"The President and Administration's position has always been clear: while Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America Last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.\"Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States,\" he added.Fed officials have been inclined to look through the duties as a one-time hit to prices and not a source of underlying inflationary pressures. The S&P researchers found similar sentiment among analysts.The consensus looks for a 64 basis point contraction in profit margins this year, fading to 28 basis points for 2026 and then 8 to 10 basis points in 2027-28. A basis point equals 0.01%.\"In effect, 2025 locked in the hit; 2026 and 2027 will test whether the market's optimism about re-equilibration is warranted,\" the authors wrote. \"For now, consensus envisions a world where margins eventually recover to pre-tariff trajectories. Whether that faith proves justified will depend on how firms adapt through technology, cost discipline and reshaped global value chains that have defined this cycle.\"The impact also likely will depend on how Trump's tariff strategy evolves. The White House currently is back in heightened tensions with China over a rare earth dispute and Trump's intentions to retaliate.The S&P paper found that Trump's removal in May of the \"de minimis\" exception for goods under $800 was \"the real inflection point\" for how hard tariffs would bite. The exception had allowed low-priced goods to sail under previous tariff barriers, but \"had become politically untenable.\"\"When the exemption closed, the shock rippled through shipping data, earnings reports, and executive commentary,\" Sandberg said.\"In the optimistic scenario that this turbulence is temporary, the Trump administration's tariff agenda and the resulting supply chain realignments are viewed as transitory frictions, not permanent structural taxes on profitability,\" he added.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump listens during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesViresh Varma can't sleep. The CEO of AV Universal Corp., a small footwear company that sells through retailers like Macy's, Nordstrom and DSW, said he needed to take out a $250,000 loan to pay his tariff bill on a container of shoes he imported from India for the holiday shopping season. Varma didn't have the cash on hand to pay the duties, which he said used to be around $7,500 for a similar-sized container before President Donald Trump's new tariffs. But without the financing, he wouldn't have anything to sell during the holidays.So the 64-year-old said he was faced with a choice: take on the line of credit— which came with onerous terms like weekly payments and a 32% interest rate — and raise prices to pay it back, or close the business he's spent the last nine years building. He decided to take out the loan.\"Everybody believes that I'm a fighter, so I'm fighting it,\" Varma told CNBC in an interview. \"We've reduced some salaries. We had planned to hire some people we're not going to hire anymore. … If things don't look good, especially after increasing the prices, and we don't get the sales, then obviously we may lay off some people, as well.\" AV Universal is just one of the many small businesses that are buckling under Trump's global trade war, struggling to pay the sudden increase in duties and forecast what's ahead as policy evolves. Businesses of all sizes have raised prices and negotiated with vendors to weather the tariff storm and many larger retailers have so far proven resilient, with minimal impact to their profitability and future growth outlooks. Better-than-expected quarterly reports have led investors to largely shrug off the tariff threat, as the S&P 500 hovers near record highs.But the higher costs have hit smaller companies harder because they have fewer levers to pull than their larger competitors. Their margins are slimmer, their supply chains less diverse and their negotiating power with vendors dampened by the smaller sizes of their orders.Small businesses owners interviewed by CNBC said they largely expect to be able to manage higher costs from tariffs by raising prices, but only if it doesn't cause shoppers to buy less — which most are already starting to see.Often called the backbone of the U.S. economy, small businesses routinely represent more than 40% of the nation's GDP and employ nearly half of the American workforce, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Trump says his tariffs allow the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits with other nations and encourage domestic manufacturing, but some of the small business owners who spoke to CNBC said that's happening partially at their expense.The struggles they're facing could be a warning sign for the rest of the economy and bigger businesses in 2026, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\"The small businesses … they're kind of like the canary in the coal mine here,\" said Smetters, the faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model. \"They're going to get hit first, and then I think you're going to see more of an impact with some delay on larger businesses.\" Larger retailers have been able to manage higher tariff costs in part because they had the foresight and ability to order extra inventory before the new duties went into effect, said Smetters. At a certain point, that stock will run out and push costs higher, and those companies only have so many low-tariff countries where they can produce goods.The fate of many of Trump's tariffs is unclear after a federal court ruled them illegal, prompting an appeal from the White House that the Supreme Court is now reviewing. The nation's highest court, which includes three Trump appointees and has a 6-3 conservative majority, agreed to hear the appeal on a faster-than-normal timeline with arguments scheduled for the first week of November. It's unclear how fast the justices will issue a ruling, and the tariffs remain in effect during the appeal.CNBC spoke with around a dozen business owners to better understand how tariffs are affecting them. Here's how much the duties are costing some of those companies — and what the businesses are doing to offset them.AV Universal Corp.Total tariffs paid in 2024: $45,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $353,125Employees: 10Supply chain: India 80%, Vietnam 15%, Europe 5% Varma, AV's CEO, spent much of his career in corporate America before deciding to get into the footwear business about a decade ago. He built three brands from scratch that are now sold online by Amazon, Macy's, DSW, Nordstrom and other retailers. Varma was in the process of sending orders for the 2025 holiday season — which typically accounts for about 40% of AV's annual revenue — when Trump announced tariffs on dozens of trading partners on April 2. Thinking the president was bluffing, Varma placed an order for 20,000 pairs of shoes from his manufacturer in India, but ultimately only shipped half because he couldn't line up the financing necessary to pay the expected tariff bill on the entire order. Varma expects holiday sales to drop about 30% because he'll have less inventory to sell, but that decline could get worse if consumers balk at the higher prices he implemented. Since he increased prices earlier this year, sales fell about 30% in August and September. Varma has searched across the globe to escape the Trump administration's 50% tariff on Indian goods and is now considering moving his manufacturing to China, as long as Trump walks back his latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 100%.Talus ProductsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: ~$223,000*Total tariffs expected in 2025: ~$499,000*Employees: 9Supply chain: primarily China  *The figures are adjusted for order volumeTalus Products co-founder and CEO David McClees (middle left) pictured with his team during the holidays. HandoutDavid McClees, co-founder and CEO of Talus Products, opened his business 38 years ago with a single product: an inflatable travel pillow. The company has since expanded into a range of items, including car organizers and other travel accessories, that it distributes through retailers like The Container Store, Amazon and airport gift shops. McClees said he's not worried about having to shut down operations, but said he expects tariffs to put a \"severe crimp\" in his annual profitability. The company raised prices on certain products to offset tariffs, but is waiting until January to hike again, partially over concerns it could dampen consumer demand during the holiday shopping season. Sales on Amazon, which account for more than half of Talus' revenue, have already been \"soft\" in recent weeks, he said. \"We're nervous,\" said McClees. \"We don't typically offer huge discounts on Prime Day, but we do see a bump from their increased traffic, and that was smaller than what we would normally see. It seems like buyers are being very cautious.\" McClees attempted to move some of Talus' production to Mexico and Vietnam, but said he ultimately decided it was too expensive.Village LightingTotal tariffs paid in 2024: less than $50,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: at least $1 million Employees: between 11 and 17, depending on seasonSupply chain: 50% spread across Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand, the other 50% in China  Village Lighting CEO Jared Hendricks (center, pictured in white) with his wife, children and son-in-law. HandoutJared Hendricks, founder and CEO of Village Lighting, started his business 20 years ago making Christmas lighting and decorations before expanding into holiday storage, selling directly to consumers via his website and through big-box stores like Walmart and Target. Since his business is centered around the holidays, his buying and cash flow needs are unique compared with others in the retail industry. Every year, just before Christmas, he said he uses a $2 million line of credit he took out against his home to buy the inventory he needs for the following year's holiday and then uses that eventual revenue to pay back the debt. This year, he had to use that line of credit to pay his tariff bill. \"Hopefully I can turn around and mark things up enough for people to buy them from me so I can pay back my tariff debt,\" said Hendricks. \"It's to the point now where it could kill us, it could take us down, and I could lose everything. I can't afford to not bring stuff in because I'll have nothing to sell. So that's a game over scenario.\" Because of Village Lighting's unique buying schedule, the company had to take a loss on about 40% of its annual sales because the orders and pricing were already contractually agreed upon when many of the new duties went into effect. Hendricks said he hopes to make it up by raising prices on his website and wholesale customers. Sales so far this season have been down between 8% and 10% and he owes millions of dollars to his suppliers, who have agreed to accept late payments. Hendricks said the situation has created massive stress for him and his wife, adding that the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic posed to his business feel like \"a piece of cake\" compared with now. \"I call them my demons. They're my two or three o'clock in the morning demons, where they just wake me up in a panic, like, 'how am I going to pay for this? Or how am I going to make this work? What have I done? Should I have quit last April and just cashed in?'\" said Hendricks. \"Being a small business owner isn't worth it when your country turns on you.\" Picnic TimeTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $950,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: $2.25 millionEmployees: 75Supply chain: 85%-90% in China, the remainder in India Picnic Time CEO Paul Cosaro, shown in a gray shirt, with his family outside of the company's headquarters. HandoutPaul Cosaro's family business, Picnic Time, was started 43 years ago by his father, an Italian immigrant on a mission to sell high-quality picnic baskets. The company now sells a wide range of products, from coolers to beach chairs, to major retailers like Kohl's, Target and Macy's. Since Trump's new tariffs went into effect, Picnic Time had to freeze hiring and capital expenditures, limiting its ability to produce and release new products, Cosaro said. \"It absolutely has stifled innovation,\" he said. \"You don't want to take risks anymore ... there's no room for error.\" Cosaro said he attempted to move his supply chain to other countries during Trump's first term, hiring additional staff and conducting sourcing missions in India and Mexico. But years later, he was only able to move about 10% of production. He said he raised his prices earlier this year to account for the new tariffs and the third quarter has so far been \"very, very, very soft.\" Sales are down about 20% and key retailers have pulled back on orders. The holiday season is always important to Picnic Time, as it accounts for about 35% of annual revenue, but this year it feels like the company is putting \"all of our eggs in one basket,\" said Cosaro. \"For us, it's critically important,\" he said. \"We're literally going to be waiting until the last day of the year to find out if this is going to be a profitable year or not.\" For now, Cosaro said he will keep his supply chain primarily in China. He's considered moving some of it to the U.S., but said he doesn't have the budget available to take the risk. CitibinTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $67,883Total tariffs expected in 2025: $380,000Employees: 8Supply chain: 90% Vietnam, 5% China, 5% U.S. Frank Picarazzi, the chief operating officer of Citibin (left) with his wife Liz Picarazzi, the company's founder and CEO (right).Courtesy: Frank PicarazziWhen Liz Picarazzi first started Citibin, which makes rat-proof trash enclosures for cities, parks and homes, the company manufactured in the U.S. After a few years, she said she found U.S. producers couldn't meet her expectations on price, quality or lead time. She moved production to China and for several years, the business enjoyed manageable tariffs and reliable partners. However, in the lead-up to the 2024 election, she and her husband Frank Picarazzi, Citibin's COO, started looking for other options over concerns that either candidate would raise tariff rates. \"I told Frank two days after the election, 'we're going to Vietnam, like, as soon as we can,'\" Liz Picarazzi said. The couple spent the next few months moving most of their production to Vietnam, only to learn of Trump's decision to raise tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports to 50%. That raised costs for just about every product Citibin sells. Though her supply chain is now more diversified, Liz Picarazzi said that moving to Vietnam was \"somewhat pointless\" as a result. Meanwhile, she said higher costs are affecting talent retention, research and development, and revenue. The company has added a 15% tariff surcharge to products to offset the cost of tariffs. Frank Picarazzi said it has contributed to a 25% decline in sales to homeowners, which the company expects will account for about 50% of overall revenue this year. Reekon ToolsTotal tariffs paid in 2024: $65,000Total tariffs expected in 2025: more than $400,000Employees: 20Supply chain: Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and China Christian Reed, founder and CEO of Reekon Tools, on a job site holding the T1R Hybrid Laser Tape MeasureHandoutResearch and development is critical for Christian Reed's tool startup Reekon. He said the company had to cut back R&D spending by 20% because of tariffs. \"This certainly put a thorn in the side of our hiring plan for the rest of the year around engineers for R&D activities,\" said Reed. \"That's something that will continue to have to either be paused or completely canceled if nothing changes.\" The hundreds of thousands of dollars Reed planned to use to hire between three and five designers and engineers is now going to tariffs instead, he said. The company, which makes innovative products like digital tape measures for tradespeople, needs to ensure every tool it produces is effective and able to withstand tough conditions on worksites. \"There's a unique combination of making a product that you can feed up, throw on the concrete, you know, slam around and not break, and at the same time add this digital aspect,\" said Reed. \"So that puts a very high burden on the testing, the research we have to do … it's a very costly product as most of the products we're making are new to [the] world.\" Reed said he's avoided raising prices on most items, choosing to take the hit to profit margins, but recently increased the price of a new tool – a smaller version of its digital tape measure. Initially, Reekon wanted to price it at $99 and while the margins would've been slim, the company expected to be able to make it up in volume, Reed said. However, after tariff rates rose, the company priced it at $119 when it launched in September to help it offset losses in other parts of the business. While the product has been well received, sales so far have fallen short of the company's projections. ",

Conway is a longtime Democratic donor who was a member of VCs for Kamala, and donated around $500,000 to at least two funds tied to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 election campaign.The New York Times was first to report on Conway's departure from the Salesforce Foundation. A Salesforce spokesperson confirmed his exit in an emailed statement.\"We have deep gratitude for Ron Conway and his incredible contributions to the Salesforce Foundation Board for over a decade,\" the spokesperson said, noting that the group has donated, \"$250 million to public schools and education nonprofits to advance opportunity and access for young people, including $30 million announced this week.\"The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits and resulting in citizens and immigrants being detained without legal representation.In a story published late last week in The New York Times, Benioff indicated that he would welcome troops to San Francisco, home to Salesforce. The company's annual Dreamforce conference began in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff later appeared to walk back his comments, writing on X that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" However, by that point, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other right-wing figures had seized on his original comments, amplifying them to their audiences.Musk, who has drawn criticism for his personal drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\" And on Wednesday, Trump called San Francisco \"a mess,\" and suggested possibly sending in the National Guard.According to the Times, Conway told Benioff in an email that their \"values were no longer aligned.\" While Benioff has donated to members of both parties, he has supported Democrats for president, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Conway is founder and managing partner of SV Angel, an early-stage venture firm. He has long been an advocate for tech in San Francisco, having founded trade organization sf.citi and helping start FWD.us, which focused on immigration reform.The Salesforce Foundation isn't his only connection to Benioff's philanthropic efforts. Conway is also a large donor to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.Conway didn't respond to a request for comment.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders on Wednesday issued statements and held press conferences to deliver the message that federal troops are not welcome in the city, and that crime is coming down.Conway has supported Newsom, including in 2021, when he opposed a recall effort against the Democratic governor.WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff sits down with Jim Cramer at Dreamforce 2025watch now",

    "body": "watch nowElectricity companies across the U.S. are struggling to figure out how much demand will actually materialize from the artificial intelligence boom, as the stock market speculates that vast sums of money will be spent on infrastructure to support a big data center buildout.\"There is a question about whether or not all of the projections, if they're real,\" Willie Phillips, who served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from 2023 until April 2025, told CNBC. \"There are some regions who have projected huge increases, and they have readjusted those back.\"The AI companies are rolling out ambitious plans to build server farms that in some cases would consume as much electricity as entire cities. But the tech industry is shopping the same big projects around to multiple utilities as they look for the quickest access to power.\"We're starting to see similar projects that look exactly to have the same footprint being requested in different regions across the country,\" GridUnity CEO Brian Fitzsimons told CNBC. GridUnity uses software to give utilities and transmission operators a clearer picture of where power projects are requesting connections across the patchwork U.S. electric grid.This data center shopping is making it difficult for utilities to determine how much power generation they will need to ensure the reliability of the electric grid. Electricity prices, meanwhile, are rising for consumers because power supply is already struggling to keep pace with demand.FERC Chairman David Rosner warned in September that the difference of a few percentage points in electricity load forecasts \"can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills.\"\"Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don't forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,\" Rosner said.Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez warned of the problem on the nuclear power operator's May earnings call: \"I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here.\"AI bubble fearsThe stock market, however, is not really pumping the breaks. The steady pace of big data center announcements is fueling one of the biggest rallies in power company stocks in two decades.The utility sector has gained about 21% this year after rallying more than 19% in 2024. The companies that supply the U.S. with electricity have gained nearly $500 billion in value over that two-year period. The last time utilities advanced more than 40% in consecutive years was in 2003 and 2004.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in August that the stock market is facing an AI bubble, cautioning investors that they were getting \"overexcited.\"While the exact magnitude of the coming demand is uncertain, experts generally agree that the U.S. is facing a historic increase in electricity consumption after a long period of flat growth. Existing data centers point to what is coming, Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, said.watch now\"We can see it. Data centers exist,\" he said. \"They're operating day in and day out, using a lot of electricity. It used to be the case a 50 megawatt data center was pretty big. Now, it's very common to have data centers that are 20 times that size — that are a gigawatt.\"Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm, estimates 120 gigawatts of additional electricity demand by 2030. This includes 60 gigawatts from data centers based on forecasts from the utilities. To put that in perspective, 60 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the 2024 peak hourly power demand of Italy, the world's eighth largest economy.\"This is not a bubble,\" Fitzsimons said. \"It's going to transform our nation completely. It's going to continue to grow. We need a 50-year energy policy.\"But the utilities need to get firm financial commitments from the data centers, Gramlich said.\"That is going to help us rationalize all these requests and get a better handle on the total estimate,\" he said. \"But the industry's got to plan based on the best information we have at the moment.\"The uncertainty about demand forecasts has raised concerns that utilities could spend billions of dollars on infrastructure that is not needed in the end. The utilities spent $178 billion on grid upgrades last year and are forecasting $1.1 trillion in capital investments through 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute.Fitzsimons said the risk of the utilities overbuilding is lower than it was two decades ago due to constraints in the market.\"They're in a very different environment where we have massive supply chain problems,\" Fitzsimons said. \"We have inflation running off the hook for quite a long time now. They can't afford overbuild. It's going to come down to better planning.\"Infrastructure constraintsA month after warning of a bubble, Altman struck a deal with Nvidia in which OpenAI would build 10 gigawatts of data centers with the chipmaker's graphic processing units. The plan requires as as much electricity as New York City during the energy intensive summer days, raising questions about whether they can actually secure the power needed.It may be possible to secure that much electricity but the AI industry is facing contraints as their plans grow larger, Gramlich said. The companies are competing for scarce infrastructure, he said, which is increasing prices for essential electrical equipment like transformers, switches and breakers.\"We really don't have the electrical infrastructure to meet the aggressive targets,\" the analyst said. \"We don't have enough generation or transmission infrastructure to meet even the modest midpoint targets.\"The question is how fast new generation can be built, he said. Natural gas turbines are largely sold out through the end of the decade. The tech industry is investing in advanced nuclear power, but these technologies are not expected to reach commercial scale until the 2030s at the earliest.Renewable energy, meanwhile, can be deployed at the quickiest speed, particularly solar and battery storage. More than 90% of the power projects waiting for a grid connection right now are solar, battery storage or wind, according to August data from energy consulting firm Enverus.\"For the past 10 years, our interconnection cues have been filled with a massive percentage of renewables,\" Fitzsimons said. \"The renewables are the fastest way to build out new capacity. There's no doubt in that because of the supply chain issues we have around natural gas turbines.\"But President Donald Trump opposes solar and wind while promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear power, raising uncertainty about whether enough new generation can be built. Utilities will turn data centers away if they do not have enough power available, Gramlich said.\"If they literally do not have the power to serve a customer, they're not going to sacrifice reliability,\" Gramlich said. \"That's their core job.\"Some AI companies believe they have found a solution — just build the power at the data center off the grid, called \"behind the meter\" in industry lingo.\"We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview on Oct. 8. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" he said.",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin watches with binoculars the Tsentr-2019 military exercise at the Donguz range near Orenburg city on September 20, 2019.Alexey Nikolsky | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia was an indirect beneficiary of the war in Gaza in that it distracted the U.S. and other Western countries from its ongoing war in Ukraine.But now that there's a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and a fledgling peace process has begun, U.S. President Donald Trump is turning his sights on ending the war in Ukraine.The president said Thursday that he and other \"high-level advisors\" will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss how to end the war. It comes following a call with the two leaders in which Trump said Putin had congratulated him on the \"great accomplishment of peace in the Middle East.\"\"President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. ... I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The meeting will be the second time the leaders have come face-to-face during Trump's second term, and could happen within the next two weeks, according to the U.S. leader.Tomahawk missilesOne way the White House is turning the screws on Moscow is by mooting the possibility of supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Trump is due to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, with the leaders expected to discuss the matter.Earlier in the week, Trump told reporters that he might use the Tomahawk missiles as leverage with Russia, saying he could tell Putin, \"Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.\"In another sign that the administration could be ready to deepen its military support for Kyiv, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promised Wednesday that \"firepower\" was coming for Ukraine, although he did not mention Tomahawks by name.Read moreRenewed push for peaceTrump made no secret this week of the fact that he and envoys were planning to immediately renew efforts to bring the war in Ukraine to an end as it approaches its fourth anniversary.Addressing Israeli lawmakers on Monday as he celebrated a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, Trump told the Knesset, Israel's parliament, \"We have to get Russia done.\"\"Steve, let's focus on Russia first, alright? We'll get it [done],\" Trump said, addressing U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.watch nowHaving boasted ahead of his second term in office that he could get the Ukraine war to end in just \"one day,\" he conceded that it had proved trickier than he anticipated, noting: \"I thought it would be easily settled. I thought it was a hell of a lot easier than doing what we just did [in Gaza].\"Victoria Coates, vice president at the Heritage Foundation's Davis Institute, told CNBC this week that the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas would likely have an impact on the Russia-Ukraine war.\"The momentum behind resolving the Gaza conflict can help get to a resolution of the Ukraine war,\" Coates, a deputy national security advisor in Trump's first administration, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\"All these other countries that the president was meeting with [this week], and getting them behind conflict resolution, [can lead to] maybe putting some pressure on Putin to come to the table. So this can have a positive effect on Ukraine,\" she said.watch nowOf course, the big question now is whether Russia is ready to play ball with Trump and his team.Will Moscow play ball?The Kremlin appears to be keen to show willingness in working toward ending the conflict, although critics (not least Ukraine) say that Russia is skillful at employing delay tactics so it can prolong the war to make territorial gains.On Tuesday, the Kremlin reiterated Russia's position, vehemently disputed by Kyiv and its Western allies, that it was Ukrainian intransigence that was preventing an end to the war which Russia launched in February 2022.\"Certainly, we welcome such intentions, we welcome the confirmation of the political will to assist the search for peaceful solutions in every possible way,\" Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday, in comments reported by Interfax.Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a summit of leaders of nations, which are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in Moscow, Russia October 8, 2024. Sergei Ilnitsky | Via ReutersRussia \"remains open to and ready for a peace dialogue,\" Peskov said, adding that \"we hope that the influence of the United States and the diplomatic prowess of President Trump's envoys will certainly help prompt the Ukrainian side toward a greater readiness for a peace process.\"CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment on its expectations for renewed talks with the U.S., and is awaiting a response.Calling Putin's bluffRussia's ability to wage war in Ukraine with relative impunity could be nearing an end, with Trump showing increasing frustration with Putin in a clear change from the rapport on show at their Alaska summit in August.U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before a joint news conference following their meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Gavriil Grigorov | Via ReutersAside from touting the prospect of giving Ukraine Tomahawks — which the Kremlin admitted last Sunday was of \"extreme concern\" — Trump has been putting pressure on Russia's allies, slapping tariffs on India for buying Russian oil.Trump, who recently disparaged Russia as a \"paper tiger,\" has also repeatedly threatened to put further sanctions on Russia itself but has so far held off, disappointing Kyiv and other Western partners.Tomahawk talks could be a turning point for Russia, according to Peter Dickinson, editor of the Atlantic Council think tank's UkraineAlert publication. Dickinson on Tuesday said that this will be the case if Trump is willing to call Putin's bluff by pledging to supply Tomahawks, regardless of whether he does end up doing so.Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

There are mounting indications that he may be inclined to do so,\" Dickinson said. \"Trump now has an opportunity to convince his Russian counterpart that he is not as easily intimidated as other Western leaders and is more than ready to increase the pressure on Moscow until Putin agrees to pursue peace,\" he said in an online analysis.\"Many of Trump's detractors will no doubt scoff at the idea of the U.S. president adopting such a uncompromising stance toward Putin, but few objective observers would question that this approach is the only way to end the war,\" he said.",

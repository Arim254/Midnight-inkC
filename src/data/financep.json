    "body": "A few weeks ago, I tweaked my back putting weights on the rack at the gym. When things didn't get any better after a week of rest, ice and ibuprofen, I decided to go to the orthopedist. After sharing my medical history and the details of my injury with the nurse, I sat in the exam room goofing around on my phone waiting for the doctor. The next knock at the door wasn't a physician, however, but a technician. \"Come across the hall for an X-ray,\" she said.  \"Oh good,\" I should have thought. \"They can get to the bottom of what's wrong.\"Instead, I felt a pang of dread. Earlier this year I was trying to sort out a skin condition and went to see an allergist. They told me they'd run the standard test where they prick you with 50 or so different allergens and see which ones you react to. It went well enough — it turns out I'm not allergic to much of anything. A few months later, the bill for the test came in the mail. It was close to $500. Because I hadn't hit my annual deductible yet, I was on the hook for the whole thing. I was pretty shook. Not once had any of the doctors I'd seen discussed that this procedure might be costly for me. They just ran the tests and scheduled me for a follow-up. So when I returned to the orthopedist's exam room having gotten my X-ray, still having not hit my deductible, all I could think was, \"What did that just cost me?\" In hindsight, I shouldn't have just quietly followed her. But refusing to go with the X-ray technician until she quoted me a price felt rude. Plus, how would she even know the cost? What you pay for any given procedure depends on your insurance coverage as well as rates your insurer has negotiated with the health-care provider's billing office.I'm not the only one recovering from health-care sticker shock. A 2024 study from private health-care foundation the Commonwealth Fund found that 45% of insured, working-age adults had received an unexpected bill in the previous year. Your first step to avoid unexpected bills is to talk with your health-care provider. That may mean speaking up during a medical consultation, or having more involved conversations with your insurance company and your doctor's billing department, says Carolyn McClanahan, a medical doctor, certified financial planner and founder of financial planning firm Life Planning Partners. That can feel intimidating, especially if you're on the spot, says McClanahan. You want to speak up for yourself and avoid surprise bills, but, if you're like me, you don't want to ruffle any feathers when you need care. How to avoid surprise medical billsI still haven't gotten the bill for my X-ray. But the discomfort I felt bringing up cost with the technician is a common phenomenon, says McClanahan. Nevertheless, it's worth it to speak up and advocate for yourself both before and after your treatment, she says. Talking with your provider beforehand can help you understand the costs of procedures and put you on a path toward treatment you can afford. And even if you need high-priced treatment, doing some research and putting in legwork around costs can help you avoid sticker shock down the line. Here are three steps McClanahan recommends to avoid surprise bills. Step 1: Communicate with your doctorIf you, like me, are put on the spot with a procedure of indeterminate cost, the first thing to do is ask your provider whether it's really necessary, says McClanahan. You may find that there's wiggle room on timing or cheaper alternatives to procedures or drugs the doctor recommends. McClanahan suggests a possible script: \"I have this really, really high deductible, and I'm trying to manage my bills. Can you please let me know what it's going to cost or verify that I really need this now?\"Discussing your concerns with your doctor up front may help you get a treatment plan that's more in line with your budget, she says. Step 2: Do the best you can to shop aroundEven if you have concerns about price, you may absolutely need a certain procedure. And if you haven't yet hit your deductible in a given year, you're likely going to have to pay up. If you need to schedule a treatment at a later date, you can potentially save yourself some money by comparing costs at different providers, says McClanahan. That means calling around to different medical providers in your area and asking their billing department what they charge for the treatment you want. Getting answers won't always be straightforward, however, McClanahan says.\"The challenge is that every insurance company negotiates different rates,\" she says. \"The person sitting at the billing desk isn't going to know off the top of their head what that rate is going to be.\"What's more, what starts out as one treatment, like a colonoscopy, can turn into a pricier procedure if your surgeon discovers something concerning and has to perform biopsies, McClanahan says. In other words, it may not be easy to pin down your medical provider's billing department on an exact price. But do your best to explain to them that budget is an important factor when it comes to whether or not you'll be able to receive treatment at their facility, McClanahan says. Step 3: Investigate your billI still haven't gotten the bill for my visit to the orthopedist. But when I do, I'd be smart to ask for an itemized list of charges, McClanahan says. \"You need to see what they've actually charged you for,\" she says. \"Then go on the internet and compare it with what's actually a reasonable charge.\"McClanahan likes the search tool at FAIR Health, which shows estimated in-network and out-of-network costs for treatment based on what providers charge in your area.If a bill you received is much higher than the average cost, or if your doctor's office has tacked on charges that don't seem to be in line with the care you received, call the billing department and plead your case, McClanahan says. In the case of my allergy test, a medical provider would be unlikely to negotiate with me, McClanahan says. The price tag was in line with what providers in my area charge, and I was billed correctly. In more extreme cases — say, ones in which a patient with a high deductible is facing down thousands of dollars in bills — medical providers may be willing to come down on costs, McClanahan previously told CNBC Make It.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "A Dick's Sporting Goods store in Pleasant Hill, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 24, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDick's Sporting Goods is planning to close a slew of Foot Locker stores now that its acquisition of the sneaker company is complete, the company said Tuesday when announcing fiscal third-quarter earnings.  It's unclear how many stores Dick's plans to shutter, but the closures are part of a larger restructuring it's implementing so Foot Locker isn't a drag on its profits come fiscal 2026, Dick's executive chairman Ed Stack told CNBC's Courtney Reagan. \"We need to clean out the garage,\" said Stack. \"We've taken pretty aggressive markdowns to clean out old merchandise. We're impairing some store assets. We'll close some stores… everything we're doing is there to protect 2026 and just kind of do this one time.\" The company declined to say how many stores would be impacted and whether the restructuring will include layoffs. As a result, Foot Locker's comparable sales are expected to be down in the mid- to high-single digits in the current quarter with margins expected to fall between 10 and 15 percentage points.Beyond the Foot Locker business, Dick's stores saw comparable sales rise 5.7% during the quarter, well ahead of the 3.6% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. For its namesake banner, the company is now expecting comparable sales to rise between 3.5% and 4%, up from its prior range of 2% to 3.5%. That's ahead of expectations for 3.6% growth, according to StreetAccount. Dick's is also now expecting full-year earnings per share to be between $14.25 and $14.55, up from a previous forecast of $13.90 to $14.50 and in line with expectations of $14.44 per share, according to LSEG. Here's how the big-box sporting goods store performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.71 expectedRevenue: $4.17 billion vs. $3.59 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 was $75.2 million, or 86 cents per share, compared with $227.8 million, or $2.75 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items including the impact of the Foot Locker acquisition, Dick's posted earnings per share of $2.78.Dick's has been a standout performer across the retail industry and now has the challenge of fixing Foot Locker's business so it doesn't weigh on its typically pristine results. Dick's $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker gave it a massive competitive edge in the wholesale sneaker market, most importantly for Nike products, and access to both an international and urban consumer. It's also super-charging the company's growth. Thanks to Foot Locker's revenue, almost $931 million during the quarter, Dick's sales rose a staggering 36% to $4.17 billion from $3.06 billion a year earlier.However, it also acquired some risks. Foot Locker has about 2,400 stores globally and has underperformed for years. Its consumer tends to skew lower-income than Dick's' and hasn't held up as well in a softening economy. Under CEO Mary Dillon, Foot Locker had worked to refresh its stores and change the way it merchandises sneakers. Since its acquisition, it began testing changes in 11 stores in North America to see if the fixes improve sales, including cutting products by over 20%, bringing back apparel and changing Foot Locker's \"footwear wall.\" \"If you'd walked into a Foot Locker store before and you looked at the footwear wall … it was nothing but a run on sentence,\" said Stack. \"It was just a whole bunch of shoes thrown up on the wall, and we took all of that down, we re-merchandised it, focused on shoes we really wanted to sell. ... It's early on, but we're pretty enthusiastic about what we've done.\" — CNBC's Courtney Reagan contributed to this report. ",

Shares of Nvidia were 3.6% lower in premarket trade. Google-parent Alphabet was trading 3% higher after a more than 6% rally on Monday.On Monday, The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. TPUs are a customized chip and experts say this gives Google an advantage over rivals as it can offer customers a highly efficient product for AI.If Meta uses the TPUs, it would be big win for Google and potential validation of the technology.Shares of Broadcom, which helps Google design its TPUs, were up more than 2% in premarket trade on Tuesday after an 11% rise the day before.watch nowNvidia remains the market leader with its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the main piece of hardware underpinning the huge AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia's dominance is unlikely to be dislodged in the near term, Google's TPUs add further competition into the AI semiconductor market.Companies building AI infrastructure have been searching for a more diversified supply of chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia. Meta is among the biggest spenders on AI infrastructure, with the company projecting its capital expenditure to stand between $70 billion to $72 billion this year. The share price moves come amid continued debate around whether there is an \"AI bubble\" and stretched tech company valuations. Nvidia has been central to the debate and the company last week reported a stronger-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter but technology stocks fell after. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump walks as workers react at U.S. Steel Corporation–Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, U.S., May 30, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has appointed two Department of Commerce officials to oversee U.S. Steel under the golden share agreement reached with Japan's Nippon, according to a letter posted Monday in the Federal Register. Trump approved U.S. Steel's controversial acquisition by Nippon in June after securing veto rights over key business decisions under a golden share arrangement. U.S. Steel stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange that same month after the acquisition was completed. Trump holds the veto powers covered by the golden share as U.S. president, but he can also designate someone else to wield those authorities as his representative if he wants. The president appointed William Kimmitt, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as his designee in a letter to U.S. Steel.\"I, President Donald J. Trump, hold the Class G Preferred Stock (Golden Share) in U.S. Steel, pursuant to the National Security Agreement (Agreement) between the United States Government, Nippon Steel Corporation, and U.S. Steel,\" Trump said in a Nov. 20 letter to U.S. Steel executive Scot Duncan.\"The Golden Share provides the President with the ability to oversee U.S. Steel's activities and to ensure the company continues operating its United States-based production facilities,\" Trump said. The golden share allows Trump or his designee to veto decisions that include changing U.S. Steel's name, moving its headquarters from Pittsburgh, relocating the company outside the U.S., or closing production facilities.  Trump also appointed David Shapiro, a chief counsel at Commerce, as a director on U.S. Steel's board representing the U.S. government, according to the letter. The golden share goes to future U.S. presidents or their designee after Trump leaves office. ",

Jim Justice holds up his dog Babydog as he comes to the end of his State of the State speech in the House chambers, at the West Virginia State Capitol in Charleston, W.Va., Thursday, Jan. 27, 2022.Chris Dorst | Charleston Gazette | APThe U.S. government on Monday sued Sen. Jim Justice, a West Virginia Republican, and his wife for more than $5 million in unpaid federal income taxes, penalties, and interest dating to the 2009 tax filing year.\"Despite notice and demand for payment of the assessments ...James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States,\" the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Beckley, West Virginia, alleged.The lawsuit, filed by the Tax Division of the Department of Justice, asks a judge to enter a judgment in favor of the U.S. against the couple in the amount of $5,164,739.75, the amount owed to the Internal Revenue Service as of Aug. 4, according to the filing.Hours after the suit was docketed, a lawyer for the Justices and the DOJ filed a joint motion asking a judge to enter a consent judgment in favor of the U.S. for the amount requested.The motion, which still requires a judge's approval, indicates that the couple agreed to resolve their case by being ordered to pay the amount requested. But it does not say when they would or could pay that money.The suit was filed nearly two months after the IRS filed notices of tax liens for more than $8 million against Justice, who is the former governor of West Virginia, in Greenbrier County.One of the notices referenced a federal income tax assessment of more than $3 million for the tax year 2009, which was assessed on Nov. 25, 2015 — the same date as the assessment referenced in the lawsuit filed Monday.The second federal income tax assessment, for nearly $5 million, was for the tax filing year 2017. A third such assessment, for the 2024 tax year, was for nearly $11,000./ Politico, which first broke the news of the tax lien on Oct. 10, noted then that the IRS website says \"generally the IRS can pursue collection of a tax liability up to 10 years from the date it was assessed. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien may be filed any time within that 10-year period.\"Tuesday is the end of a 10-year period that would have begun on Nov. 25, 2015.Justice was elected to the Senate in November 2024, replacing Sen.

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., talks with reporters in Dirksen building on Tuesday, October 28, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon on Monday said that it was reviewing what it called \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona for making a video with five other Democratic lawmakers that urged members of the military to refuse to follow illegal orders.The Pentagon said Kelly, who is a retired U.S. Navy captain, might be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial on the allegations.President Donald Trump last week called Kelly and the other Democrats \"traitors,\" and said their statements on the video were \"seditious behavior at the highest level.\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a statement on X on Monday, said, \"The video made by the 'Seditious Six' was despicable, reckless, and false.\"\"Encouraging our warriors to ignore the orders of their Commanders undermines every aspect of 'good order and discipline,'\" said Hegseth.\"Five of the six individuals in that video do not fall under @DeptofWar jurisdiction,\" Hegseth wrote. \"However, Mark Kelly (retired Navy Commander) is still subject to UCMJ — and he knows that.\" UCMJ is the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The Pentagon, in its own social media statement, said that a \"thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"\"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality,\" the Pentagon said.Kelly, in a response on X, said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death.\"\"If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly wrote.\"I've given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen. Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly had said, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democrats who underscored that same message on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Dekluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer, but all three of them separated from those service branches rather than retired from them. Because they did not retire from those branches, they are not subject to the UCMJ, as Kelly is.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Thursday, said, \"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\"\"Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country  anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET.\"The Pentagon, in its statement Monday, said, \"The Department of War reminds all individuals that military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces.\"\"All servicemembers are reminded that they have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful,\" the statement said.\"A servicemember's personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.\"Greg Lukianoff, CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, an advocacy group, in a statement said, \"The Pentagon's actions are clear retaliation for something Sen. Kelly is entirely within his rights to say.\"\"America's servicemembers already take an oath to uphold the Constitution, which includes not following illegal orders,\" Lukianoff said. \"The argument that the video's message is sedition, or otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment, is flatly wrong.\"",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor who shot to fame for calling the housing crash before 2008, has launched a Substack newsletter after deregistering his hedge fund, aiming to lay out in detail his increasingly bearish thesis on artificial intelligence.\"The Big Short\" investor is capitalizing on the massive audience he's built on X, where 1.6 million followers have long parsed his cryptic posts. His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late 1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. 'I doubted if I ever should come back. I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he contends history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms.\"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

Here's how the company did in its fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 versus LSEG estimates:Revenue rose 5% to 247.8 billion Chinese yuan ($34.8 billion) versus 242.65 billion yuan the previous year. Investors are focused on Alibaba's cloud computing division which books its revenue related to artificial intelligence. Over the past few quarters, Alibaba's cloud revenue growth has accelerated. Alibaba reported a 34% year-on-year rise in cloud computing revenue to 39.8 billion yuan versus expectations of 37.9 billion yuan. That growth rate was faster than the 26% notched in the June quarter.The Chinese tech giant said its investments in AI were helping its cloud unit. \"Robust AI demand further accelerated our Cloud Intelligence Group business, with revenue up 34% and AI-related product revenue achieving triple-digit year-over-year growth for the ninth consecutive quarter,\" CEO Eddie Wu said in an earnings statement on Tuesday.watch nowIn September, the company said it plans to increase spending on AI models and infrastructure development, on top of the 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) over three years it announced in February. Alibaba said on Tuesday it has spent around 120 billion yuan in capital expenditure toward AI and cloud infrastructure over the past four quarters.Earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA), a measure of profitability, increased by 35% to 3.6 billion yuan for its cloud division.Alibaba has emerged as one of China's leading AI players. On Monday, Alibaba said its Qwen app, the Chinese giant's rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT, surpassed 10 million downloads within the first week of its public launch. The app is powered by Alibaba's Qwen artificial intelligence models. Investors look past profit dropMeanwhile, the company has been investing heavily in the cut-throat instant commerce market. This a product offering from Alibaba and some of its Chinese e-commerce rivals that promises super-fast delivery on certain items.Investment in this new segment has weighed on the profitability of Alibaba's overall business even as cloud computing remains strong. Overall adjusted EBITA, a profitability measure closely-watched by analysts, fell 78% year-on-year to 9.1 billion yuan, with Alibaba attributing this partly to its investments in quick commerce. But investors appear to be looking past this because of the growth acceleration at the cloud computing business and Alibaba's core China e-commerce division which houses revenue from its online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall as well as the quick commerce initiative. China e-commerce revenue rose 16% year-on-year to 132.6 billion yuan, with growth coming in faster than the previous quarter.Revenue from quick commerce surged 60% year-on-year in the quarter versus 12% in the quarter before. \"In our consumption business, quick commerce continued to scale with significant improvement in unit economics and drove rapid growth in monthly active consumers on the Taobao app,\" Wu said.

Shares of the other company, then known as E-Waste, were worth even more on paper at one point despite owning no appreciable assets. Judge Christine O'Hearn, in a scathing order about the Cokers on Monday, said, \"It appears ... that, despite having substantial liquid assets at the time the sentence was imposed, neither Defendant has complied with the restitution deadlines set by the Court.\"\"It appears to the Court that Defendants have purposefully failed to make payment, perhaps in an effort to avoid doing so and/or dissipating or transferring assets,\" O'Hearn wrote in U.S. District Court in New Jersey.Peter Coker Sr. and his wife Susan Coker at U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, March 15, 2023.Dan Mangan | CNBCPeter Coker Sr., who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, owed his first installment of $2.5 million in restitution within 30 days of Aug. 11, according to an order by O'Hearn in August. Coker Jr., a businessman who previously lived in Hong Kong, owed his first installment of $1.5 million within 30 days of the same date.The Cokers and a third defendant who pleaded guilty in the case, James Patten, are jointly liable for the $5.56 million in total restitution. Patten has yet to be sentenced; because of that, he is not currently required to start paying restitution.Retail investors are owed $178,849 in total restitution. And investment arms of Duke and Vanderbilt universities are owed $3.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in restitution.In her Monday order, O'Hearn demanded answers from prosecutors and the Cokers' lawyers within two weeks on questions related to the failure to pay restitution so far.The judge told them \"to take all necessary steps forthwith to secure payment of the restitution amounts previously ordered.\"One potential hurdle to getting money from Peter Coker Jr. is the fact that the 57-year-old is no longer in prison — or even the United States. Coker Jr. renounced his U.S. citizenship years ago.On Oct. 16, a day after his release from prison, he was deported to the Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, where he has citizenship, according to a letter to O'Hearn from his lawyer.Peter Coker Jr., left, is issued search warrants from police at his villa on the southern resort island of Phuket, Thailand, Jan. 11, 2023.Crime Suppression Division, Royal Thai Police | APHis father, Peter Coker Sr., 83, is slated to be released on Dec. 8 from a residential reentry facility in North Carolina maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, having been released from a prison in Butner, North Carolina, on Tuesday.Coker Sr.'s lawyer, Zach Intrater, in a letter last week to O'Hearn, disputed the idea that he owed any payments toward restitution while he was still locked up in prison.Intrater, who did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC, in that letter said that \"Mr. Coker, Sr., is not looking to avoid his responsibilities under the amended judgment,\" and that he \"will begin making the required payments toward restitution.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

In May, O'Hearn sentenced the elder Coker to six months in jail, and Coker Jr. to 40 months in prison. The younger Coker was released last month because he received credit for the more than two years he spent locked up in a New Jersey jail before his sentencing.John Azzarello, a lawyer for Coker Jr., in a letter to the judge on Thursday, said his representation of Coker Jr. ended with his sentencing, that he has no contact with the fraudster since his sentencing, and \"we do not know Mr. Coker Jr.'s current whereabouts.\"\"Mr. Coker Jr. also has an outstanding invoice for legal services rendered which remains unpaid to date,\" Azzarello wrote. Azzarello did not respond to requests for comment.CNBC has also requested comment from the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey, which prosecuted the Cokers and Patten.",

The guides include top products, key differences between the products and the latest information from retailers, according to a blog. Users will be able to tailor their guides based on their budget, what features they care about and who they are shopping for. OpenAI said it will take a couple of minutes to generate answers with shopping research, so users who are looking for simple answers like a price check can still rely on a regular ChatGPT response.When users submit prompts to ChatGPT that say things like, \"Find the quietest cordless stick vacuum for a small apartment,\" or \"I need a gift for my four year old niece who loves art,\" they will see the shopping research tool pop up automatically, OpenAI said. The tool can also be accessed from the menu. OpenAI has been pushing deeper into e-commerce in recent months. The company introduced a feature called Instant Checkout in September that allows users to make purchases directly from eligible merchants through ChatGPT. Shopping research users will be able to make purchases with Instant Checkout in the future, OpenAI said on Monday. OpenAI said its shopping research results are organic and based on publicly available retail websites, and that it will not share users' chats with retailers. It's possible that shopping research will make mistakes around product availability and pricing, the company said.Shopping research is rolling out to OpenAI's Free, Go, Plus and Pro users who are logged in to ChatGPT.WATCH: OpenAI taps Foxconn to build AI hardware in the U.S.watch now",

Santiago | Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that Lindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney who brought both indictments, was invalidly appointed.Halligan, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, had been installed as prosecutor in violation of the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, senior U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie ruled in both cases in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Ms. James's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie ruled. An identical line appears in a separate order scrapping Comey's case. The cases were both dismissed \"without prejudice,\" potentially allowing charges to be filed again at a later date.The rulings are a major blow to Trump, who had openly pushed Attorney General Pam Bondi to take legal action against Comey, James and other perceived political foes.\"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CNBC in a statement.Bondi said later, \"We'll be taking all available legal action, including an immediate appeal to hold Letitia James and James Comey accountable for their unlawful conduct.\"Halligan is the fourth U.S. attorney of the second Trump administration to have been deemed wrongfully appointed by a judge.Comey, in an Instagram post celebrating the dismissal, said his prosecution was \"based on malevolence and incompetence, and a reflection of what the Department of Justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.\"\"I know that Donald Trump will probably come after me again,\" Comey said, \"and my attitude is going to be the same: I'm innocent, I am not afraid, and I believe in an independent federal judiciary, the gift from our founders that protects us from a would-be tyrant.\"Halligan's office declined to comment on Currie's rulings. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\"I am heartened by today's victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" James said in a statement following the dismissal. \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"Comey was charged in late September on counts of making a false statement and obstruction stemming from his testimony to Congress years earlier.James was charged in mid-October with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a mortgage she obtained to buy a home in 2020.Both had asked the judges in their respective cases to throw out the charges on the grounds that they were being vindictively prosecuted.   The indictment against Comey, a longtime target of Trump's ire, came days before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire on Sept. 30.Currie's ruling suggested that Comey's statute of limitations remained in effect. In a footnote, the judge quoted a ruling from a separate case, which held, \"An invalid indictment ... cannot serve to block the door of limitations as it swings closed.\"The charges against Comey also came less than a week after Bondi, at Trump's behest, had appointed Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.The prior U.S. attorney for the district, Erik Siebert, had resigned after reportedly expressing concern about pursuing charges against Comey — and after Trump said publicly that he wanted Siebert out.In addition to the constitutional violation, Currie determined that Halligan's installation ran afoul of a statutory mechanism for appointing interim U.S. attorneys. The law, which gives the attorney general 120 days to make interim appointments, had been triggered by the appointment of Siebert on Jan. 21, the judge wrote.When that clock ran out on May 21, \"so too did the Attorney General's appointment authority,\" Currie ruled.Halligan has therefore \"been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her appointment on Sept. 22, Currie wrote.The judge noted that in both cases, Halligan was the only prosecutor who presented information to the grand juries that ultimately returned the indictments.James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, said he would challenge \"any further politically motivated charges\" from the Trump administration.\"The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"This case was not about justice or the law; it was about targeting Attorney General James for what she stood for and who she challenged.\"",

    "body": "A Tesla logo outside the company's Tilburg Factory and Delivery Center.Karol Serewis | Getty ImagesTesla is trying to get its \"FSD Supervised\" technology approved for use in the Netherlands. But Dutch regulators are telling Tesla fans to stop pressuring safety authority RDW on the matter, and that their efforts will have \"no influence\" on the ultimate decision. The RDW issued a statement on Monday directed at those who have been sending messages to try and get the  agency to clear Tesla's premium partially automated driving system, marketed in the U.S. as the Full Self-Driving (Supervised) option. It's not yet available for use in the Netherlands or Europe broadly. \"We thank everyone who has already done so and would like to ask everyone not to contact us about this,\" the agency said. \"It takes up unnecessary time for our customer service. Moreover, this will have no influence on whether or not the planning is met. Road safety is the RDW's top priority: admission is only possible once the safety of the system has been convincingly demonstrated.\"The regulator said it will make a decision only after Elon Musk's company shows that the technology meets the country's stringent vehicle safety standards. The RDW has booked a schedule allowing Tesla to demonstrate its systems, and said it could decide on authorization as early as February. Last week, Tesla posted on X encouraging its followers to contact RDW to express their wishes to have the systems approved. The post claimed, \"RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026,\" adding a message to \"please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible.\" Tesla said other EU countries could then follow suit. The RDW corrected Tesla on Monday, saying in a statement on its official website, that such approval is not guaranteed and had not been promised. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Tesla's FSD-equipped vehicles in October following reports of widespread traffic violations tied to use of the systems.The cars Tesla sells today, even with FSD Supervised engaged, require a human driver ready to brake or steer at any time.For years, Musk has promised that Tesla customers would soon be able to turn their existing electric vehicles into robotaxis, capable of generating income for owners while they sleep or go on vacation, with a simple software update.That hasn't happened yet, and Tesla has since informed owners that future upgrades will require new hardware as well as software releases.Tesla is testing a Robotaxi-brand ride-hailing service in Texas and elsewhere, but it includes human safety drivers or supervisors on board who either conduct the drives or manually intervene as needed. Musk has said the company aims to remove human driers in Austin, Texas, by the end of 2025. WATCH: Tesla bear on company's EV businesswatch now",

    "body": "An Obamacare sign is displayed outside an insurance agency on Nov. 12, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWith enhanced Obamacare tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, Republicans are proposing new alternatives aimed at lowering the cost of health care. Their window for doing so is rapidly closing — and leaving middle-class Americans uncertain in the balance. The White House is expected to make an announcement this week addressing efforts to either renew or replace the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, MS Now on Monday reported an announcement has been delayed in part due to congressional backlash, according to two White House officials.The news could not come soon enough for Shana Verstegen and her husband. The couple buys insurance through the ACA exchange and is facing a 50% premium increase for their family plan in 2026 if the enhanced tax credits are not renewed by Congress. \"We have been looking at our expenses, and it's tough now because everything's really expensive already,\" with little room to cut costs,\" said Verstegen, a fitness instructor from Madison, Wisconsin. \"We're looking at a few activities our kids do and things like that.\" Verstegen traveled to Washington during the government shutdown to advocate for extending financial support for middle-class ACA enrollees like her family. Since the government reopened, she's been watching the discussions on Capitol Hill around so-called Obamacare tax credits warily. \"I'm thrilled that lawmakers are finally at the table and talking about ways to make health care more affordable. What I'm frustrated about is there is less than a month to do something,\" she said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., promised Democrats the chamber would vote on extending the enhanced tax credits in mid-December as part of a deal to end a record-long government shutdown.Dec. 15 is the deadline for the majority of Americans to sign up for 2026 ACA coverage, and as Congress headed home for the Thanksgiving recess, there was no consensus on Obamacare credit funding or what those subsidies would look like.   GOP proposes cash payments Some Republicans in the House signed a bipartisan letter urging Senate leadership to have negotiations that include members from both chambers to find a way to extend the enhanced tax credits for a year.  The subsidies, enacted during the Covid pandemic, provide aid for middle-class enrollees by capping their portion of premium payments at 8.5% of income.  The cost of extending the tax credits is more than $30 billion per year, according to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.   President Donald Trump has opposed an extension of the Obamacare tax credits that he says fund the \"money sucking\" insurance industry, stating in a post on his Truth Social platform, \"The only healthcare I will support or approve is sending the money directly back to the people.\" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., has introduced a bill that would give ACA enrollees cash through a Health Savings Account called a Trump Health Freedom Account, which they could use to pay for both premiums and health expenses. According to the bill, the payments would be effective starting Jan. 1. The current ACA subsidies are based on mid-tier Silver plans as the benchmark coverage option. Those plans have an average deductible of just over $5,000, according to health policy organization KFF.watch nowSen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., has proposed making the lower-tier Bronze plan the benchmark for enhanced subsidies, while providing cash to offset the higher Bronze plan deductible. According to KFF, Bronze plan deductibles average more than $7,000.   Cassidy told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday his proposal would provide subsidies for the lower-tier plan, limiting out-of-pocket premium costs at levels similar to those under a Biden-era proposal. \"But we're using a cheaper policy so it's easier to do,\" he explained. \"That gives us savings to put into a Health Savings Account.\"Trading down from a benchmark Silver plan to a Bronze plan without the enhanced tax credits would not save enrollees much money. A 60-year-old couple in Florida earning $86,000, for example, would qualify for a $0 premium on a 2026 Bronze plan with an enhanced tax credit, according to a premium calculator from KFF. Without the credit, the same plan would cost $2,169 per month, or more than $26,000 per year.  Racing the clockWith Congress out for the Thanksgiving recess, there is less than a month left of the legislative calendar. Getting an HSA funding measure not only passed but implemented for the start of coverage next year may not be possible, according to Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. \"Conceptually, what they're talking about is a radical restructuring of how the ACA marketplaces and tax credits work, and we literally are days away from when people have to pay their January premiums in order to effectuate their coverage,\" Corlette said.Oscar Health CEO Mark Bertolini said a national plan in which the government or employers give consumers cash to buy their own coverage in the marketplace is something he supports in the long run, but extending the enhanced tax credits makes the most sense now. \"I think that's how they're going to solve this problem, so they get past the midterms, and they have time to put together a fulsome plan,\" Bertolini said. Enrollees face Dec. 15 deadline Regardless of whether the tax credits are extended, the deadline to sign up for 2026 coverage remains firm for now. For those enrolling on the healthcare.gov exchange, it is just three weeks away. On some state-run exchanges such as those for California and Massachusetts, the deadline is Jan. 31. Obamacare premiums for 2026 have spiked as insurers expect some enrollees to drop of out of the market, in part because of the uncertainty over the extension of the enhanced premium tax credits. Oscar Health has been working with insurance brokers to reach out to its members about more affordable plans. \"We believed, out of the people affected by enhanced subsidies, that we could sell to 85% of them. And right now, what we're seeing says maybe more,\" said Bertolini. KFF's executive vice president for health policy, Larry Levitt, said enrollees should consider signing up by the Dec. 15 deadline even if Congress does not manage to pass a premium relief measure before the end of the year, because the Trump administration has tightened rules for signing up outside of open enrollment. \"The premiums are still month-to-month, so you're committing to one month's premium. If it's unaffordable, you can always drop out, but you can't come back in if you don't sign up,\" Levitt said. ",

Sandisk will replace marketing company Interpublic, which is being acquired by Omnicom, S&P Global said in a statement. It's the latest tech company to join the S&P 500, which gets an increasing amount of its value from internet, software and semiconductor businesses. AppLovin, Datadog, DoorDash and Robinhood became members of the index earlier this year.Stocks tend to rally when they're added to the benchmark as fund managers who track the S&P 500 need to buy shares to reflect the changes. Western Digital bought Sandisk in 2016 for $15.6 billion. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of about $33 billion.Sandisk sells fast storage drives for gaming PCs, digital cameras and security cameras, and is also trying to land deals with large-scale data center builders. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 23% to $2.31 billion. The company reported a 31% increase in exabytes sold. Omnicom announced plans to acquire Interpublic in December, and on Monday said the deal received antitrust approval from the European Commission.WATCH: WDC CEO: SanDisk deal great for shareholderswatch now",

    "body": "Every job, when you boil it down, is simply people talking to other people. As a career coach, I've advised professionals at all career stages. From what I've seen, the people who get ahead the fastest know how to communicate in a way that truly gets people to listen. You may not realize it, but the language you use could be standing between you and what you want. Here are five simple language swaps that can help you succeed, forge meaningful relationships, and demand more respect at work.1. Swap closed asks for open asks You're always going to face moments where you have a question you're not quite sure how to ask. Maybe you want to work from home, take a sabbatical, or get an extra week of vacation for your honeymoon. Because these are high-stakes situations, most people walk into the conversation radiating anxiety, cornering their opponent, or blurting out a closed-ended, yes-or-no question.But making an open-ended ask can take the pressure off both parties and invite a dialogue about a process, priority or norm. It makes you look thoughtful, rather than entitled. Instead of \"Can you write me a recommendation?\" try \"What does your typical process for writing recommendations look like?\"Instead of \"Can I leave early Friday?\" try \"How does the team typically handle flexibility on Fridays?\"Instead of \"Can I get a promotion?\" try \"What would you say should be my priorities if I want to get promoted this year?\"2. Swap apologies for gratitudeWhether it's a typo in a Slack message or you're running 15 minutes late to an important meeting, missteps happen. Genuine apologies are necessary at times, but over-apologizing often backfires. Research has found that habitual, unnecessary apologizing can erode how others perceive your competence and confidence. But it can also feel awkward not to acknowledge small mistakes, so I recommend replacing unnecessary apologies with gratitude. Instead of \"Sorry I'm a minute late!\" try \"Thank you so much for waiting. Let's get started.\"Instead of \"Sorry for all the questions,\" try \"I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through this.\"Instead of \"Sorry, I know this is last-minute,\" try \"Thanks for being flexible with the timeline. I know this is last-minute.\"3. Swap your 'buts' for 'ands' The word \"but\" often negates everything that comes before it. Whenever you're stating two things that are equally valid, I encourage you to replace \"but\" with \"and.\" Instead of \"I love my job, but I need a raise,\" try \"I love my job, and I need a raise.\"Instead of \"This was a great quarter, but we need to improve retention,\" try \"This was a great quarter, and we need to improve retention.\"Instead of \"I appreciate the feedback, but I disagree,\" try \"I appreciate the feedback, and I see it a bit differently.\"The \"and\" version of these examples doesn't minimize either statement. It allows two things to be true at once, promoting greater nuance and clarity. 4. Swap 'I feel like…' for 'I noticed that'\"I feel like\" can come across as gentle, soft, and humble, which are all wonderful things to be. But in a professional setting, it can soften your message to the point where it can be easily dismissed. It frames your professional observations as personal emotions. In a work environment where data and clarity carry weight, that framing can work against you. Here's what you can say instead:Instead of \"I feel like we're behind schedule,\" try \"I've noticed we're falling behind schedule.\"Instead of \"I feel like we should go with option two,\" try \"My recommendation is to move forward with option two.\"Instead of \"I feel like we aren't on the same page,\" try \"It seems like we're not aligned on this.\"5. Swap 'why' with 'how' or 'what'Questions that begin with \"why\" can put people on the defensive. Even if unintended, \"why\" often implies judgment, asking someone to justify their choices or thinking.When someone feels like they need to defend themselves, the conversation stops being collaborative and starts being adversarial. Instead, invite your conversation partner to walk you through their thought process, rather than demanding they explain themselves.Instead of \"Why do you think launching a week earlier would be smart?\" try \"How do you think launching a week earlier would benefit the campaign?\"Instead of \"Why are you doing it like that?\" try \"What technique are you using?\"Instead of \"Why did you move the meeting?\" try \"What was the reason for moving the meeting?\"Instead of \"Why did you assume it wouldn't work?\" try \"How did you come to that conclusion?\"Ultimately, when you make these shifts, the person you're talking to will feel more heard and respected — and will be more willing to have an honest conversation with you as a result. Erin McGoff is the founder of AdviceWithErin and author of \"The Secret Language of Work.\" Follow her @AdviceWithErin.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

    "body": "ByteDance's new AI video model Seedance 2.0 is displayed on a smartphone screen. Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant ByteDance has said it will strengthen safeguards on a new artificial intelligence video-making tool, following complaints of copyright theft from entertainment giants. The tool, Seedance 2.0, enables users to create realistic videos based on text prompts. However, viral videos shared online appear to show copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, raising intellectual property concerns in the U.S. \"ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the spokesperson added. ByteDance's response comes after receiving backlash and stern warnings from Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing major Hollywood studios including Netflix, Paramount Skydance, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney. The group issued a forceful public statement at the end of last week demanding that ByteDance immediately cease what it called \"infringing activity.\" \"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,\" said MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin in the statement. \"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.\"According to a report from Axios, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance, accusing the company of distributing and reproducing its intellectual property through the new AI tool without permission. The legal notice alleged that ByteDance had effectively pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art,\" the report added. Disney has also sent cease-and-desist letters to AI companies in the past. In September, the company warned the AI startup Character.AI to stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.While trying to protect its intellectual property, Disney has signed a licensing deal with and invested in OpenAI. The agreement allows the AI company to use Disney characters from the Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, making similar accusations, Variety reported over the weekend.",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesAn annual cigar festival in Cuba's capital city of Havana, which had been due to take place over five days in late February, has been suspended until further notice due to a worsening economic crisis.The postponement comes as the island nation's communist-run government endures its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Habanos S.A., the cigar fair's organizer, said on Saturday that it had suspended the festival \"with the aim of preserving the highest standards of quality, excellence and experience that characterize this international event.\" The organizing committee said it was working on setting a new date for the fair, without providing further details. The festival has previously welcomed more than 1,000 guests from around 80 countries, with attendees participating in auctions and touring tobacco plantations. Premium Cuban cigars are globally renowned and considered of high economic importance, serving as one of the island's main exports and a major source of foreign currency. They are illegal in the U.S., however, due to a decades-old trade embargo. Last year, Habanos. S.A., a state-run entity that holds a monopoly on global sales of Cuban cigars, reported record sales of $827 million in 2024, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the year prior.

Cuba's government, which has condemned U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors. Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" earlier in the month. \"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.",

    "body": "Tequila Turner collected her last regular paycheck in October 2024. Since then she's traded her steady career in corporate IT for freelance projects and gig work, like delivering for DoorDash. Her income plummeted from six figures to a fraction of that last year, she tells me over the phone between making deliveries. She moved in with friends to save money. And she's been hard at work looking for a new job — but so far, no real luck. Turner, 47, says she lost her job over a year ago when her contract role with a bank ended. The Kansas City, Missouri, resident is part of the growing share of Americans who are not only unemployed but have been looking for work for six months or more, making them what the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as \"long-term unemployed.\" Official numbers about the job market show a relatively stable labor economy with stronger than expected job growth in January — more than half of jobs added were in health care — and a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, or 7.4 million people.But the share of people who've been out of work for six-plus months has been rising for the last three years. Typically, long-term unemployment has gone down after the job market recovers following recessionary shocks like the pandemic or Great Recession.Today, 1 in 4 unemployed people, or 1.8 million Americans, have been job searching for over half a year, which in most cases means they've also exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits. Benefits vary by state but on average replace less than 40% of a person's previous income.In today's challenging hiring environment, stories like Turner's are becoming more common.Why long-term unemployment is on the riseThe pool of job opportunities has been shrinking for a while: Job openings, hiring and voluntary quits (which signal workers' confidence in being able to get a new job) have been sliding since the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2022. Meanwhile, U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in all of 2025 (compared to 1.46 million in 2024), and businesses announced 108,435 layoffs in January.These compounding factors mean those looking for a job are having a harder time landing one.Businesses are no longer adding jobs and are slowly trimming their workforce to correct for over-hiring directly after the pandemic recession, says Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter.\"The moment we're in right now in labor is stagnation across the board for workers and for employers,\" she says. While workers moved jobs (and even quit on their own) after other recessions like the 2008 financial crisis or Covid-19 pandemic, today they're staying put.\"Unemployment is becoming more of a status quo versus a temporary position for workers who find themselves out of their job,\" Bachaud says.People who've been out of work long-term tell CNBC Make It the experience has chipped away at their confidence and made them question their career decisions. Some have taken on part-time work to pay for bills, while others have moved in with family. They say they're doing everything by the job-searching playbook, and even trying new methods, but still nothing seems to be working.Big challenges for young workersThe tough hiring market is hitting certain demographics hard, including young professionals.Chris Fong, 25, says he thought it wouldn't be too hard to find a job when he was laid off from a startup in March 2025. He went to a top-tier university, did well at his previous jobs and lives in the Bay Area, a major job market.But in the months since, Fong says he's noticed a drop in entry-level jobs, and he's often competing with candidates with more years of experience or higher graduate degrees than him.Fong's observations reflect a larger trend: Entry-level job postings were down by about 35% in mid-2025 compared to January 2023, according to research from Revelio Labs.Chris Fong is an early-career job seeker in the San Francisco Bay Area.Courtesy of subjectHe's also noticed the interview process getting longer as companies get \"more picky,\" he says. One recent company required eight rounds, and he still didn't get the role.Fong says he's been living on savings and recently took up a part-time job working at a friend's film rental gear company. It's minimum wage but helps pay the bills. In January, he started documenting his unemployment journey on Instagram as a creative outlet and to regain control of his life and career story. \"I was tired of letting these recruiters and companies judge me based off my previous experience\" on a resume, he says. \"I was like, 'I'm going to start something myself.'\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue.Sakshi PatelJob seeker in BostonSome recent grads say changing immigration policies add stress to their search.Sakshi Patel, 22, earned her master's degree in financial management in May 2025. She's currently volunteering at a nonprofit as a business analyst, but as an international student from India needs to find employment by the spring in order to stay in the U.S. Now, she's worried new policies, like the Trump administration's revamping the H1-B visa program and adding a $100,000 application fee, will mean companies won't be looking to hire international students who need visa sponsorship like her.Sakshi Patel graduated with her master's degree in May 2025 and hopes to secure a full-time job in finance.Courtesy of subjectPatel says she's trying everything to get hired: She lives in Boston but will relocate anywhere and is open to jobs not related to her major. She estimates she sends 30 to 40 tailored applications per week but rarely hears back.\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue,\" she adds. \"A lot of people are doing everything they're supposed to be doing and still not getting work.\"From feeling in-demand to 'completely ignored'Myriam Samake laments the lack of transparency in hiring today. When she landed her job as a multimedia news journalist in 2023, she'd contacted the news director on LinkedIn, set up two phone interviews, and had a gig lined up after grad school. The contract role ended in June 2025.The 27-year-old in Sterling, Virginia, keeps an Excel spreadsheet with all of her applications in the last seven months, which is 150 roles and counting, including getting to final interviews for two roles but no offers. One company completely ghosted her, she says.Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?Myriam SamakeJob seeker in Sterling, Virginia\"It's at that point where if I did get an offer, I would take it 100%,\" she says. \"It's sad in a way, where I don't know if we can be as picky anymore.\"In another sign of the challenging job-seeker market, more workers are making a lateral move or taking a pay cut for a new job, and the share of new hires who say they landed their \"dream job\" is down, according to ZipRecruiter data from the final months of 2025.Samake says she doesn't have high hopes to land hers. \"I'm trying to look for places that have diversity. I am a Black woman, and that's important to me,\" she says. \"Do I have to lower my expectations on that or the salary I want? Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?\"Like many job seekers, Samake is frustrated with the state of applying to jobs online and never really knowing if the materials she pours over make it to a human reviewer. In mid-2025, the average job opening received 242 applications, or three times the average in 2017, according to Greenhouse data reported by Business Insider.\"It's such a mental war,\" Samake says.Even experienced workers are having a hard time. Greg Roth, 52, remembers back in 2022 getting to final interviews with four companies and securing two competing offers. The D.C.-based executive communications professional joined Thumbtack, the home repair marketplace, in June 2022, but by December was laid off along with 14% of the company. Greg Roth is an executive communications professional in the Washington, D.C. area.Courtesy of subjectHe resumed looking for a full-time job in 2024 but says interviews are hard to come by. \"In a short amount of time I've gone from feeling very in-demand to feeling completely ignored,\" Roth says. \"My skills haven't changed, so either the market has changed, or there's just less hiring.\"Both are likely, says Bachaud, the ZipRecruiter economist. Businesses have been scaling back on hiring due to a number of economic factors (like high interest rates and stubborn inflation), political challenges (like new tariff policies) and shifting business objectives (like investments in AI), Bachaud says.And now, the supply of job seekers it outpacing demand in hiring: As of December, there were roughly 1 million more people looking for work than there were available jobs, according to BLS data analyzed by Indeed.What job seekers wish others knew about long-term unemploymentAndrew Bohan says one of the hardest parts of dealing with long-term unemployment isn't just the constant rejection, but also not have a satisfying answer when people ask how the search is going.Bohan lost his paralegal job in August 2024, exhausted his unemployment insurance benefits in March 2025, and in January 2026 moved from Chicago to Baltimore to live with family and keep bills low.\"I like to tell people being unemployed isn't the problem; it's keeping your head screwed on that's the real problem,\" he says. He says he can feel pressure to \"prove\" he's being proactive about his circumstances among friends and family, though that's hard to show without the results of interviews or offers.Losing a job can have long-term impacts: Research has shown that losing a job is associated with declines in psychological and physical wellbeing, social withdrawal and long-term earning losses. Other studies have shown people who experience unemployment tend to get new jobs earning about 5% to 15% less than similar workers who did not lose their jobs.Bohan, who's recently applied to hourly service jobs to no avail, tries not to be too pessimistic about his situation. Otherwise it shows up in his interactions, from recruiters to friends and family. \"You just have to focus on what's in front of you and what you can do about it,\" he says.That can be as simple as getting a good night's rest in order to be ready to apply to new jobs the next day, Bohan says: \"I don't like being idle. I want to get back into the game.\"These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives. We want to do the work.Tequila TurnerJob seeker in Kansas City, MissouriTurner, the risk management worker in Kansas City, hopes long-term job seekers recognize that it takes a lot of self care and encouragement to not internalize the challenges of unemployment. To those who do have jobs or know others struggling with the search, \"I wish people knew this is not a choice,\" Turner says. \"It's new to us. These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives.\"Many job seekers, like Turner, have years of work experience and valuable skills they've earned over their careers, she says. Now they just need the opportunity to showcase that to an employer, she says: \"We want to do the work.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "Skynesher | E+ | Getty ImagesNew laws enacted in 2025 may have a big impact on how much Social Security beneficiaries pay in taxes this season.On Jan. 5, 2025, President Joe Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act, a law that ended provisions that reduced or eliminated Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million individuals who have pension income from work that did not require payment of Social Security payroll taxes. Later that year, on July 4, President Donald Trump signed the \"big beautiful\" tax package, which includes a new tax deduction of up to $6,000 per eligible senior to help offset taxes on Social Security benefits. Up to 85% of Social Security benefits may still be subject to federal tax, depending on the beneficiary's income.Together, those changes will influence the tax liabilities that Fairness Act beneficiaries face this tax season. \"If you're getting higher benefits because of the Social Security Fairness Act, some percentage of those are going to be taxable,\" said Alex Durante, senior economist at the Tax Foundation.watch nowThe monthly benefit increases for affected beneficiaries range from \"very little\" to more than $1,000, according to the Social Security Administration. In addition, affected individuals received retroactive lump-sum payments representing benefit increases to monthly checks from January 2024 onward.The tax liabilities associated with that extra benefit income may be reduced with the new senior \"bonus\" deduction, if the recipient qualifies, Durante said.To qualify for the full $6,000 deduction — or $12,000 if married filing jointly — individuals need to have a modified adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, while couples may have up to $150,000. \"They're better off because their Social Security benefit went up, and they're better off because they're basically getting a bigger deduction,\" said Karen E. Smith, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.How the Social Security Fairness Act worksPresident Joe Biden after he signed the Social Security Fairness Act at the White House on Jan. 5 in Washington, D.C. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Social Security Fairness Act eliminated two provisions: the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, that reduced Social Security benefits for people with pensions from jobs not covered by Social Security, and the Government Pension Offset, or GPO, that adjusted Social Security spousal or widower benefits for individuals who also receive pension income from jobs where Social Security taxes were not withheld.Among the more than 2.8 million people affected by those provisions are some state teachers, firefighters and police officers; federal employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System; and workers covered by a foreign social security system, according to the Social Security Administration.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThis change applies only to people who receive pension income based on work that did not include the payment of Social Security payroll taxes, according to the agency. Those individuals also qualify for Social Security benefits based on payroll taxes paid into the program through other work.Around 72% of state and local public employees were not affected by the law, as they pay Social Security taxes — and therefore will not see a benefit increase, according to SSA. What beneficiaries should know this tax seasonThis is the first tax-filing season that Social Security Fairness Act beneficiaries will see those payments in their SSA-1099s, a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CNBC via email. Those tax forms show their Social Security benefit income.The Social Security Administration has said that as of July, it completed more than 3.1 million payments totaling $17 billion to eligible Fairness Act beneficiaries. The adjustments included higher monthly benefit payments and one-time lump-sum payments.The lump-sum payments sent under the Social Security Fairness Act are generally taxed as Social Security benefits received during the tax year, and are included in the SSA-1099 statement, the SSA spokesperson said. The SSA-1099 is also sent to the IRS. Recipients of those retroactive payments may want to consider selecting a box for a \"lump-sum election\" on this year's Form 1040 or 1040-SR for seniors, according to Lawrence Pon, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant at Pon & Associates in Redwood City, Calif. Pon is also an enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS.watch nowBeneficiaries who received benefits that were taxable in 2025, including a lump-sum benefit payment for an earlier year, can \"reduce the taxable amount\" with the lump-sum election, according to the IRS.The lump-sum election allows beneficiaries to recalculate their taxable benefits for a prior year by subtracting the taxable benefits they previously reported, according to the IRS. The remaining amount is the taxable part of the lump-sum payment to report for 2025.Using the lump-sum election does not require a taxpayer to adjust an earlier return, nor does it require filing an amended return, according to the IRS.\"If it results in a lower tax, take advantage of it,\" Pon said. \"If it doesn't, ignore it. Don't waste your time.\"Pon's said his father, who receives a state pension from California, now receives Social Security survivor benefits because the GPO was eliminated. However, the benefit change was not automatically processed. To access the benefits, Pon's father visited a Social Security office with proof of his marriage, including past joint tax returns and their wedding album.If you think you may be eligible for higher benefits under the new law, it's worthwhile to check, he said.\"There's probably people who qualify for it and don't know about it,\" Pon said.",

Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

    "body": "It's a sunny, 70-degree February afternoon in Los Angeles, and crowds have been pouring into Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters' home nonstop.A stereo system filters music into their kitchen, dining area and through the open doors to their backyard, where dozens of people sip coffees, chat in groups or type away on their laptops.The couple isn't just entertaining friends and family. Wayser, 39, and Watters, 42, are the creators behind LA's hottest new coffee shop, Granada, which the married couple runs out of their own home in Echo Park's Angelino Heights.Just over a month into their venture, they say they're having their busiest day yet.Like usual, they opened their doors at 9 a.m. Within hours they sold out of their pastry selection, had to DoorDash additional milk and called on a neighbor to go for an ice run. It's 2:30 p.m. by the time I arrive, 30 minutes to close, and there's still a line to order.The fact that the home-based cafe has been such a hit in a town with \"so many phenomenal coffee shops\" is still a shock to Wayser, who says they \"didn't expect this at all.\"\"I think that people really want community,\" she says. \"My guess is the part that feels so special is just the private intimacy of being in a house.\"Granada is one of the latest small businesses to open through California's Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation, or MEHKO, program, which allows residents to make and sell food from their home. Given the cafe's instant success, more Angelenos could be opening their own micro-restaurants soon, meaning the new hottest place to hang out could literally be in your own backyard.A home-based coffee shop takes shapeWayser and Watters first heard about the MEHKO program last summer thanks to reporting from KCRW and The New York Times. The program was introduced in California in 2019 and authorized in LA County in 2024.Wayser says she didn't think much of it at first. Then, she became fixated.The couple had regularly attended a neighbor's family-style dinner hosted from their garage during the pandemic, which Wayser says felt like a home-based pop-up restaurant. They'd also specifically designed their own home, which they bought in 2019, for entertaining.Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters opened Granada, a coffee shop they run from their home, in January.Talitha BullockAs a new mom, Wayser says she was figuring out how to spend her days with her 3-year-old daughter heading to preschool. As a musician, artist and designer, she was eager to find a new way to put her skills to use, especially with her work in film and TV up in the air as the industry struggles.Wayser says she's spent her career producing shows, planning events, managing business finances and running an LLC for her creative work. When she thinks about it, \"I have been an entrepreneur my whole life,\" she says. \"I just didn't really put it together, because it's always been my art.\"She and her husband, a fellow musician and visual artist, have collaborated on design projects throughout their relationship, including their home. Running a coffee shop together sounded like a fun new experiment.The couple spent months going through the process of getting a MEHKO permit, which includes food safety certification, business licensing and inspection from LA County's Department of Public Health. They say the $597 application review fee was waived because they were among the first 1,000 businesses in the program. The annual health permit for MEHKO businesses, which covers annual inspections and enforcement, costs $347.The MEHKO program sets a cap on gross annual sales of $100,000; businesses are limited to 30 meals per day or 90 per week. MEHKO operators can also be approved to serve as a commissary for up to two food carts, which would expand the amount of meals they can serve per week and also bump their gross annual sales max to $150,000 per year.I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works.Sydney Wayserco-founder of GranadaThroughout the fall, Wayser and Watters got to work outfitting their home kitchen with espresso machines, additional dining and seating areas, custom ceramics from local artist Amy Louise Johnson and new artwork fit for a modern cafe. They asked a friend to refer them to a \"coffee wizard\" and teamed up Chad Aaron to create their coffee menu; they also tapped local baker Sasha Piligian for their pastry selection.Granada officially opened its doors in January 2026.An emerging neighborhood hot spotBecause of the limitations around MEHKO, skyrocketing sales isn't the goal for Granada. Wayser says they'll consider shortening their hours or limiting days of service in order to stay in operation for a longer stretch throughout the year.Other than potentially launching a coffee cart or two to raise their MEHKO sales cap, Wayser says they don't expect to open a commercial coffee shop. \"As soon as you're in a commercial space and your rent is so high, it's not about community anymore,\" she says. \"The reason this works is that you can buy something or not. You can hang out in the yard as long as you want. We will be paying our mortgage no matter what.\"Granada offers a menu of classic espresso drinks, teas, and pastries sourced from local baker Sasha Piligian.Oscar Mendoza, Talitha Bullock, Amber CanterburyWayser says Granada's visibility could bring new business opportunities, like courting clients to host private events, concerts and art shows from their home.She also hopes the coffee shop's success inspires other people to strike out on their own. There are currently about 265 MEHKO-permitted operations throughout LA County.Wayser says that while the program wasn't necessarily designed to encourage new parents, specifically new moms, to start a business, it's had that effect on her. \"There aren't very many things where you're able to start a new business in such short time period\" or around a condensed schedule, like the typical school day, she says.\"I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works,\" she says, adding that the stakes are lower without having to rent out commercial space.She's already heard from one inspired friend.\"Our neighbor just today said that maybe he'll apply for MEHKO and start making sandwiches and serve [them] out his window, which would be really fun,\" Wayser says. \"This would become MEHKO Alley.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "The TikTok Inc. sign in front of the building on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026 in Culver City, CA.Kayla Bartkowski | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesTikTok's U.S. joint venture seems to have survived a turbulent rollout with minimal change in usership, as early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.Survey data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show that, despite a surge in deletions following the announcement of TikTok's U.S. joint venture on Jan. 23, the average number of TikTok's daily active users in the U.S. remains around 95% of its usership compared to the week of Jan. 19-25.The joint venture — officially the TikTok USDS Joint Venture  — was established in compliance with U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the divestiture of TikTok in the U.S. from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.While ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations after the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX each own a 15% share, with the remaining shares divvied among several other firms.Following the announcement, users were quick to express discontent over TikTok's new ownership.The deal drew scrutiny, with prominent figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raising concerns about cronyism over Oracle co-founder and Chief Technical Officer Larry Ellison's involvement.Following the joint venture's announcement that Ellison's Oracle would \"retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data\", online speculation mounted that TikTok would begin mining user data or promoting content supportive of Trump's policy positions.Such concerns spiked on Jan. 25, with users claiming that TikTok was suppressing content critical of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, and censoring buzzwords like 'Epstein' on the platform.Last month, CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word \"Epstein\" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC in January that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it was investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.CNBC reached out to the White House and TikTok for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Engagement metrics unchangedAlthough TikTok attributed last month's disruptions to power outages, the glitches \"no doubt impact[ed] how and what content was being served, even without any intent or motive,\" according to Jim Johnston, partner at law firm Davis+Gilbert LLP.Yet despite various user pledges to boycott the platform over apparent political suppression, engagement metrics among U.S. users suggest there has been little sign of a mass exodus.The average daily time spent by American users on the platform has since returned to around 80 minutes, after dipping to an average of 77 minutes during the week of the reported disruptions, according to Sensor Tower data.Additionally, while deletions spiked after the reported disruptions, they tapered off the following week, suggesting a temporary surge rather than a sustained boycott of the app.\"It is plausible that the short-lived rise in observed uninstalls was due to an attempt to troubleshoot the app,\" Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC, as the number of uninstalls followed by re-installations on the same day surged more than 70% on Jan. 25 from the day before.While Yousef grants that the data suggests a \"slight impact to overall usage\" in the weeks after the Joint Venture was announced, there is no clear indication of a structural shift in user trends, as many sites touted as alternatives to TikTok have also struggled to sustain interest.According to Sensor Tower, the number of new installs for UpScrolled - a social media platform that offers an algorithm free of automated systems that filter out content from some users known as shadow banning - surged by about 770% from the previous week, with more than 955,000 new U.S. downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1.New UpScrolled downloads, however, fell sharply by about 80% the following week, bringing in only around 191,000 new users. In comparison, TikTok registered 870,000 downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, and around 800,000 the following week.Similarly, new downloads of other alternative platforms such as Skylight Social and Red Note respectively declined by 96% and 33% week-on-week from the week of Jan. 26.Tenuous evidence of mass exodusSensor Tower's user data more fundamentally seems to suggest that beyond anecdotal claims, users have largely been unable to identify tangible changes in TikTok's American operations, or at least, not enough to meaningfully shift user sentiment.\"The idea of a mass exodus from TikTok now looks overblown,\" Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst from Forrester, told CNBC. \"Anecdotally, most users say the app feels largely the same - the algorithm hasn't meaningfully changed, and the experience is still strong,\" While some American users may have perceived changes in the operation of their TikTok algorithms, \"some changes to content suggestions are bound to occur simply due to the changed data set,\" according to Johnston, referring to the Joint Venture's announcement to retrain the algorithm on U.S. data.But while analysts have been unable to find evidence that TikTok's new American owners have engineered the platform in their favor, this is not a foregone conclusion.According to Johnston, there are at least three notable changes to TikTok's new terms of use, including the platform's ability to collect precise location data from enabled devices, its collection of data on interactions with artificial intelligence tools on the app and its explicit integration with ad networks.Although there has been no hard evidence of its occurrence, it remains technically possible to adjust TikTok's algorithm to enhance or diminish the impact of certain types of content on recommendations, Johnston said.Chickering adds that under its new owners, TikTok has more control over what shows up on American feeds, but this control, according to Chickering, is where TikTok's opportunity - and risk - lies. \"If moderation starts to feel politically slanted or misinformation isn't adequately addressed, the platform could face backlash from users and advertisers alike,\" Chickering said, \"We've seen this play out before: Twitter's shift to X is a recent reminder of how quickly trust can erode.\"For now, however, the discontent from TikTok's American users that marred its first few weeks under new ownership seems to have largely subsided.As Chickering notes, \"we've seen time and time again, if the product works, users tend to stick around regardless of who owns it.\"— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

It reflects the strength of the business today and the strong growth prospects Qube enjoys,\" said Qube Chairman John Bevan.Qube is a major Australian logistics and infrastructure group with operations spanning Australia, Southeast Asia and New Zealand. Its network handles a range of freight services, including bulk commodity exports. The company employs around 10,000 people.The transaction is expected to be put to shareholders around June 2026, and will be subject to regulatory approvals, including from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, New Zealand's Overseas Investment Office and Papua New Guinea's competition regulator.If the deal is delayed beyond Dec. 15, 2026, the consortium would pay an extra 2 Australian cents per share per month until completion.Macquarie Asset Management currently manages around AU$720 billion in assets globally across public and private markets with portfolio companies spanning across the infrastructure, real estate and green investments sectors.",

    "body": "Pedestrians stand in front of an electronic quotation board displaying the numbers of the Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo on Feb. 3, 2026.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.While it was a reversal of the 0.7% contraction in the third quarter, the gross domestic product missed expectations of a 0.4% expansion by economists polled by Reuters.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. On an annualized basis, output rose 0.2%, compared with forecasts of 1.6%, following a 2.3% decline in the previous quarter.Compared with a year earlier, fourth-quarter GDP expanded 0.1%, slowing from 0.6% in the third quarter. Private consumption drove the modest expansion, offsetting weakness in exports and public spending, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office.Following the data release, the Nikkei 225 opened up 0.12%, but the yen weakened 0.25% to 153.06 against the dollar.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Bank of Japan in January raised its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7%. It also lifted its fiscal 2026 outlook to 1% from 0.7%.The central bank said it expects moderate expansion as other countries return to growth. The BOJ also said it sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.The data also comes as Japan works with the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, on a $550 billion investment pledge under its trade deal with Washington.Public broadcaster NHK reported last Friday that Tokyo and Washington have yet to agree on the first projects tied to the pledge. Japan Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi meets U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.After her victory, Takaichi said last Monday that she would support economic growth by boosting investment through \"proactive\" fiscal policy, although she did not elaborate. She had earlier pledged to suspend food taxes for two years and boost defence spending to 2% of the country's GDP.Defense will be the next major catalyst driving Japanese equities higher, said Bruce Kirk, Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director at Goldman Sachs. Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" Kirk pointed to Takaichi's upcoming meeting with Trump, saying he expects a \"flurry of announcements\" involving Japanese and U.S. companies across areas such as industrialization, factory automation, and shipbuilding. Kirk also highlighted a document released by the Trump administration over the weekend that called for the restoration of U.S. maritime dominance and touted cooperation with Japan and South Korea in revitalizing shipbuilding.Before the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending and vowing to support households with cost-of-living pressures. Japan's inflation had slowed sharply to 2.1% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. Still, prices have remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 45 consecutive months.— CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesApple on Monday announced that it will bring a new integrated video podcast experience to Apple Podcasts this spring.The move comes as video viewership continues to reshape podcasting. About 37% of people over age 12 watch video podcasts monthly, according to Edison Research.The update brings Apple Podcasts more in-line with its competitors Spotify, YouTube and now Netflix, which have increasingly leaned into video podcasting.\"Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services, in a statement. \"By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.\"Within the Apple Podcasts app, users will be able to switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows from the same feed. They can also use picture-in-picture mode and download video episodes for offline viewing.While Apple Podcasts has supported video through RSS since 2005, those feeds were kept separate from audio versions of the same show. The new update introduces support for HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, a streaming protocol developed by Apple that enables adaptive video playback and greater controls within the app.The new HLS format also introduces dynamic video ad insertion. Creators who distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks will be able to insert video ads, including host-read spots, into episodes.Apple said it will not charge creators or hosting providers to distribute content. However, it will charge participating ad networks an impression-based fee for delivering dynamic video ads through HLS.These launch podcast hosting partners include Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio and SiriusXM who will all be supporting HLS video.The announcement comes as competitors continue investing in podcast video. YouTube said last year it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content on its platform. Spotify has also expanded its video podcast offerings and said it paid more than $100 million to podcasters in the first quarter of last year.Netflix has also entered the video podcast space. The streaming platform inked a deal with Spotify last year to bring video podcasts to Netflix and has begun investing in original video podcast programming, including \"The Pete Davidson Show,\" which launched in January.Apple does not break out revenue specifically for Apple Podcasts, but its Services segment, which includes digital content and subscription businesses, generated $30 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.In January, the company acquired Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an undisclosed amount. The company has not released details of the acquisition, though Q.ai's website indicated it was working on audio-focused AI tools.",

The conference brings together leaders in business, government, technology, philanthropy, academia, and the media to discuss actionable and collaborative solutions to some of the most important questions of our time. Photographer: Dania Maxwell/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHyatt Hotels Chairman Thomas Pritzker said Monday that he would retire and renounced his relationship with sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Pritzker will leave his post as the hotel chain's executive chairman — a role he's held for more than two decades — immediately, he said in a statement released by the Pritzker Organization. The 75-year-old billionaire Hyatt heir said he would not seek reelection to the board at the annual stockholder meeting.\"My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship. That is important to me,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"Good stewardship includes ensuring a proper transition at Hyatt.\"Pritzker said he has \"regret\" over his connection to Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein plead guilty to state criminal charges related to soliciting prostitution, including one charge involving a minor, in Florida in 2008. He killed himself in 2019 after being arrested for federal child sex trafficking charges.Recently released files show Pritzker and Epstein exchanged friendly emails after the disgraced financier's 2008 plea deal. Being part of the release of thousands of documents and photos does not imply any wrongdoing.\"I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"I condemn the actions and the harm caused by Epstein and Maxwell and I feel deep sorrow for the pain they inflicted on their victims.\"Following his retirement, Pritzker said he would focus attention on a science foundation he began.Pritzker's announcement marks the latest in a series of high-profile resignations as more details about Epstein's dealings become public. Former Goldman Sachs Legal Chief Kathryn Ruemmler and Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp were both among the latest business leaders to step down from their positions. Both Ruemmler and Karp and have said they regret their connections to Epstein and that coverage of their ties were creating distractions for the companies they represented.Hyatt said its board appointed CEO Mark Hoplamazian to succeed Pritzker as chair starting immediately. Board member Richard Tuttle thanked Pritzker for his work and called him \"instrumental\" in determining the Chicago-based company's strategy in a press release.",

    "body": "Andrew Paterson | Photographer's Choice RF | Getty ImagesCryptocurrency payments to suspected human trafficking syndicates surged 85% in 2025, with hundreds of millions of transactions traced on public blockchains, according to a new report by Chainalysis.The U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm said most of the activity was linked to an expanding criminal ecosystem in Southeast Asia, where scam compounds, illegal online gambling operations and Chinese-language money laundering networks operate in unison. Chainalysis said in its report that crypto activity by human traffickers largely fell into three categories: International escort and prostitution services; labor placement agents and scam compounds; and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors. While data on the blockchain shows most services were concentrated in Southeast Asia, customers sent payments from across North and South America, Europe and Australia, highlighting the global reach of the operations.The report also found that cybercriminals are increasingly relying on messaging platforms such as Telegram to advertise their services, recruit victims, and coordinate payments. \"There's a broader migration from older darknet forums into messaging apps and semi‑open Telegram ecosystems, which, combined with crypto, let these networks scale faster, run 'customer services,' and move money globally with much less friction,\" Chainalysis intelligence analyst Tom McLouth told CNBC. However, Chainalysis adds that the transparency of public blockchains also provides \"unprecedented visibility\" into criminal financial flows, which watchdogs and authorities rely on to disrupt activities. \"The key takeaway is that the true financial scale is large, at least hundreds of millions of USD worth of crypto transactions, and the physical harm is orders of magnitude greater than any dollar figure,\" said McLouth. Escort and prostitution networks Blockchain activity suggests that highly organized networks were behind many transactions. While some escort services and sex work operate legally, the report said potential trafficking operations can be identified through distinct financial behaviors.In particular, suspected networks are increasingly relying on stablecoins and Chinese‑language money laundering groups to cash out quickly, McLouth said. These laundering networks operate primarily through Chinese-language Telegram channels, which can help cybercriminals \"clean\" illicit funds by moving them through cryptocurrency. Chainalysis estimates that those services funneled at least $16.1 billion in illicit funds in 2025. Data showed that crypto-linked international escort services also accounted for a significant share of higher-value transfers tracked by Chainalysis, with nearly half of transactions exceeding $10,000.Listings reviewed by researchers advertised cross-border travel packages, multi-day \"companionship\" services and tiered pricing structures, with VIP packages priced above $30,000. Chainalysis said the size and consistency of these transfers, along with repeated payment patterns between wallet clusters, suggest professionalized operations rather than isolated individuals.Crypto payments to suspected prostitution networks showed a distinct cluster of smaller transactions than those of escort services, mostly between $1,000 and $10,000. Still, Chainalysis said this data suggested operations consistent with agency-level activity.Labor recruiters and scam compoundsAnother major category involved so-called \"labor placement agents\" who recruit individuals into scam compounds, usually in Southeast Asia, known for carrying out crypto-based schemes. Recruitment fees typically range from $1,000 to $10,000 in cryptocurrency, matching the prices advertised on Telegram channels, the report said.Examples cited in the report include posts seeking \"customer service\" or \"data entry\" workers for jobs in Cambodia or Myanmar, promising high monthly salaries and covering travel costs. Once recruited, victims were allegedly forced to conduct romance scams, fake cryptocurrency investment schemes and other online frauds targeting victims abroad.In some Telegram conversations analyzed by Chainalysis, recruiters discussed transporting workers across borders, arranging forged documents and coordinating payments to intermediaries. The firm also identified links between recruitment channels and wallets previously associated with illegal gambling platforms and money laundering services, suggesting that the trafficking activity was linked to broader criminal enterprises.The scale of these compounds was highlighted last year when the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of bitcoin worth about $15 billion at the time from a massive Cambodian scam center that was running romance scams.\"Since late 2025 we've seen more enforcement around parts of this ecosystem, especially scam compounds, but the underlying sexual exploitation and trafficking networks can often keep operating via alternative infrastructure, both physical and digital,\" said McLouth.CSAM vendorsChainalysis also tracked networks involved in child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which operated under different crypto payment structures but also reflected growing levels of organization and \"sophisticated financial and distribution strategies.\"While about half of CSAM-related crypto transactions were below $100, that price point reflected individual payments within subscription-based models in private chat groups and encrypted file-sharing channels, the report said.The blockchain tracker also observed these funds moving from mainstream cryptocurrencies into privacy-focused assets such as Monero, as well as instant exchange services that require no identity verification.The report also documented overlaps between CSAM subscription services and \"sadistic online extremism\" communities.\"These [sadistic online extremism] groups specifically target and manipulate minors through sophisticated sextortion schemes, with the resulting content being monetized through cryptocurrency payments, perpetuating cycles of abuse,\" the report said.In July 2025, Chainalysis said it helped identify one of the largest CSAM websites operating on the dark web following a UK law enforcement lead. That single operation utilized over 5,800 cryptocurrency addresses and generated more than $530,000 in revenue since July 2022. \"In general, as crypto adoption grows, its use for both illicit and legitimate purposes will increase,\" said McLouth. \"In the near term, I don't expect crypto use in trafficking‑linked activity to go away, if anything, I expect it to keep growing even as enforcement gets better.\"",

    "body": "China is focusing on large language models in the artificial intelligence space.Blackdovfx | Istock | Getty ImagesChina's rapid advancement in AI is threatening to shake up U.S. dominance in the market, with one analyst warning of a tech shock that is just getting started. Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist and head of Asia research, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that America's \"perceived monopoly\" on tech and AI has been broken by China. \"I think the China tech shock is just getting started. It's not just AI, DeepSeek, and electric vehicles. China is moving up the value chain very rapidly... It's the first time in history that an emerging market economy is at the forefront of science and technology,\" Green said in a conversation with CNBC's Steve Sedgewick and Ben Boulos. China is pairing dominant-market level tech with emerging-market production costs, backed by its massive supply chain, Green said. He added that with Xi Jinping being like a \"tech bro\" that is chucking money into these sectors, it makes for a powerful mix that  is really rapidly accelerating the China tech story.Indeed, Beijing quietly launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.69 billion) national AI fund last year, and has an initiative called \"AI+\" which will see the tech integrated across its economy, industries, and society.watch nowChina is quickly catching up to the U.S. in the AI arms race, developing highly advanced models powered by homegrown chips, particularly through massive Huawei chip clusters and abundant low-cost energy. While U.S. chip giant Nvidia is viewed as the gold standard for semiconductors used to train AI models, Huawei is narrowing the gap by deploying larger volumes of chips and leveraging cheaper power to scale compute.TS Lombard's Green explained that a \"China tech sphere\" could easily form, as the world's second-largest economy's low-cost tech offerings may be more attractive to developing economies. \"China is a top trade partner for most of the world, particularly in emerging and frontier economies. What happens if that repeats on tech?\" Green said.  Developing economies that don't have a national security issue with China have a choice between \"low-cost China tech, Huawei, 5G batteries, solar panels, AI, probably some cheap RMB financing,\" or \"high-cost American and European alternative,\" he said. \"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years time,\" he added. Additionally, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, one of the world's leading AI labs, told CNBC in January that China's AI models might be just \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western rivals and are closer to those capabilities than \"maybe we thought one or two years ago.\"U.S. hyperscaler spending U.S. hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet recently announced capital expenditure of up to $700 billion on AI this year, which raised alarms about returns and caused $1 trillion to be wiped from the market caps of tech giants. Some stocks have since pared their losses.Karim Moussalem, Selwood Asset Management's chief investment officer, told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that there's a lot of \"nervousness around U.S. exceptionalism,\" especially after the sell-off in the U.S. software sector earlier this month. \"When I think of the hyperscalers' capex, we're seeing a race that's on and a lot of money being spent, and more and more question marks around whether you know all that investment, all that capex, is going to result in meaningful return on investments,\" Moussalem said. \"I think that's really what's driving this big question mark about the U.S. versus China, and whether the U.S. will be the winner in that race. But for the time being, there's a lot of capital being spent, actually a lot more than even what was expected a few months ago, with more and more question marks about the ROI,\" he added. — CNBC's Steve Sedgwick and Ben Boulos contributed to this report ",

The Parent PLUS federal loan program allows parents to borrow on behalf of dependent undergraduate students. Due to the passage of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, Parent PLUS borrowers will no longer qualify for IDR plans starting in July. IDR plans cap eligible borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income and culminate in student loan forgiveness.\"Our concern is that thousands of Parent PLUS borrowers who would otherwise be eligible for IDR plans and forgiveness post-July 2026 will not take the required action and be stuck with paying loans back in a plan they cannot afford,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

The typical parent balance is around $32,000. Here's what parent borrowers need to know about preserving their relief options. How parent repayment options are changingStarting July 1, Parent PLUS borrowers will have only one option to repay their debt: the new Standard Repayment Plan. Under Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the Standard Plan will spread a borrower's debt into fixed payments over one of four time frames, depending on what they owe. In its current form, the plan comes with a 10-year term for all borrowers.Under the revised plan, only borrowers with balances up to $24,999 will retain a 10-year repayment term. Those who owe between $25,000 and $49,999 will repay over 15 years; balances ranging from $50,000 to $99,999 will be repaid over 20 years; and debts of $100,000 or more will have a 25-year repayment term. Due to longer repayment timelines, borrowers stand to pay significantly more in interest under the new program. Often, parents risk jeopardizing their own financial futures by borrowing for their children's education, Boyd said. Having only a single repayment option could worsen the problem. \"A Standard amortizing payment can be very hard to absorb, especially if they're nearing retirement,\" she said. Consolidate before April to ensure IDR accessMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesIf borrowers consolidate their Parent PLUS loans into a so-called Direct Consolidation Loan now, they can maintain access to IDR options, Nierman said.  The consolidation process, which involves packaging your federal loans into a new one, usually takes between four and six weeks, so Nierman recommends borrowers submit their request at Studentaid.gov no later than March 31. If you've already consolidated your Parent PLUS loans, you now have a Direct Consolidation Loan and therefore more repayment flexibility, \"so you are generally not in a group with any deadline pressure,\" Boyd said. During the consolidation application process, parents must select the Income-Contingent Repayment plan and make at least one payment under that program, she added. After that, you should be able to move into the Income-Based Repayment plan, which will likely result in the lowest monthly payment, Nierman said. This is the process the Department of Education requires from its interpretation of the new law.If you're in default on a Parent PLUS loan, requesting a consolidation should bring you back into a current status and preserve your IDR plan and loan forgiveness options, she said. Current parent borrowers should plan ahead Parent borrowers with a student currently in college will need to think ahead. If you take out any new Parent PLUS loans on or after July 1, 2026, you forfeit IDR access and must repay your student debt in the new Standard program. Consolidating will not help you after that date. Parent PLUS borrowers will also face a new annual loan limit of $20,000 starting in July, with a $65,000 lifetime cap. Currently, parents can borrow up to the cost of attendance for their children, minus any other aid, and there is no aggregate limit.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff \"on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"That new tariff on imports from Iran's trading partners is \"effective immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\"This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote.Further details about the tariff announcement were not immediately clear. A White House official declined to answer CNBC's questions about the president's social media post.The apparent effort by Trump to economically isolate Iran comes as the oil-rich Middle Eastern country struggles to suppress an ongoing swell of massive anti-government protests.Dozens of those protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks; Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The president has also explicitly encouraged the demonstrations against the Iranian regime. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" he wrote on social media on Saturday.The announcement of new tariffs on Iran's business partners also comes ahead of a much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling on whether many of Trump's most expansive tariffs are legal.Those tariffs — including his controversial \"reciprocal\" duties from early April and others related to purported fentanyl trafficking — were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It was unclear if Trump's newly unveiled Iran-related tariffs also rest on that law. This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "watch nowJersey Mike's Subs is taking its signature sandwiches overseas with its first European expansion set for this year, the company said Monday. Leading the push is the brand's founder and board chair, Peter Cancro, via his company, JM Submarines UK Ltd.The deal between Jersey Mike's and Cancro's entity calls for 400 stores to be opened in the U.K. and Ireland, and it will be the first in a series of plans for international growth. The privately owned Jersey Mike's was acquired for a reported $8 billion by Blackstone in late 2024. \"All consumers, not only here in the U.S. but around the world, are looking for a great value, but they want quality. They want authenticity,\" Jersey Mike's CEO Charlie Morrison told CNBC in an interview. \"Everything about the brand screams quality and freshness, and I think that's what consumers want anywhere in the world. They're going to be picky and careful about what they choose, but we believe strongly they're going to choose Jersey Mike's over anybody else.\"Morrison noted that deli-style subs are becoming a staple internationally, and he plans to stay true to the brand's roots in this expansion. He said Jersey Mike's 20 consecutive years of positive same-store sales growth in the U.S. will help inform the international move. A Jersey Mike's restaurant in Walnut Creek, California, Nov. 21, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAt Wingstop, where Morrison served as CEO until 2022, the brand pushed heavily into international markets and was a pandemic winner in both stock performance and sales.\"I've learned that in my past, that consumers around the world really prefer that you bring them ... that which got the brand to where it is today,\" Morrison said.Cancro founded Jersey Mike's in 1975 after purchasing the first Mike's Subs store in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. He led the brand as CEO for nearly 50 years, until Morrison took over in April 2025. He said diners might see different toppings or sauces overseas than they do in the U.S., but the product will ring true to what is served in the sates.\"We see it as a great sandwich market,\" Cancro said of Europe. \"[There are] a lot of players in the marketplace, and we see a tremendous opportunity.\"The U.S. consumer is increasingly value-conscious, but Jersey Mike's believes it can still win over diners in that environment, Morrison said.\"Certainly, we've seen some challenges at the lower end across the industry, but again, at Jersey Mike's, it's a craveable product. It's one that's going to be a staple for consumers for a long time to come,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Monday condemned an investigation into her successor, Jerome Powell, saying it compromises the central bank's independence.Yellen, who served as Treasury secretary after leaving the Fed, added that she thinks financial markets should be more concerned about a situation that she called \"extremely chilling.\"\"I'm surprised the market isn't more concerned. It seems to me that the market should be concerned,\" Yellen said, according to CNBC's Sara Eisen.The comments come the day after Powell confirmed he'd been made aware that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., is looking into whether the central bank leader lied during testimony he provided to Congress last June about an expensive renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. The office is led by Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidante and former Fox News host. The Justice Department has not officially confirmed the investigation into what would be perjury charges.Yellen bristled at the notion that Powell might have lied.\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" she said.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen speaks with CNBC from the New York Federal Reserve on Sept. 26th, 2024.David A. Grogan | CNBCYellen served during the first year of Trump's initial term as president but was replaced the following year by Powell after her term ended. She went on to serve under former President Joe Biden as the head of the Treasury, the first woman to hold either position.During her time at the Treasury, critics charged Yellen used the levers of debt issuance to underwrite a ballooning national debt. Trump has badgered the Fed to lower rates, in part to ease financing costs for a debt burden currently at $38.4 trillion.Yellen said using the Fed's key overnight borrowing rate to manage the debt is irresponsible.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt,\" Yellen said, adding she \"completely [disagrees] with that. It is the road to a banana republic.\"Other former Fed and Treasury officials joined the chorus against the Powell investigation.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the officials said in a statement. Signatories included former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson, and a number of prominent economists.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly. It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement said.",

    "body": "Some retailers provided early holiday results on Monday that showed the crucial shopping season was solid, but didn't blow away expectations. Lululemon, which is preparing for a new CEO and staring down a proxy battle with its founder, said in a release it expects its holiday quarter to be \"toward the high end\" of its previously released guidance. Shoe maker Birkenstock and thrift store Savers Value Village also released lackluster early holiday results, while Abercrombie & Fitch cut the high end of its guidance. Meanwhile, American Eagle and Five Below bucked the trend and raised their guidance after better-than-expected holiday results. Lululemon said it expects fiscal fourth quarter revenue to be close to $3.60 billion and earnings to be close to $4.76 per share. Both figures are at the high end of the guidance the company released in December when it announced fiscal third quarter earnings. It made no changes to its previous guidance for gross margin, effective tax rate and selling, general and administrative expenses. Shares were about 1% higher in morning trading.\"We remain focused on executing our action plan to drive improvement in our U.S. business and look forward to the opportunities in front of us,\" finance chief Meghan Frank said in a statement. When announcing last quarter's earnings on Dec. 11, outgoing CEO Calvin McDonald said the company was \"encouraged\" by its early holiday performance but acknowledged wide discounting had driven demand during the Thanksgiving holiday period. When the shopping stretch ended, trends slowed, he said at the time. Like other higher-end brands, Lululemon has historically been very selective with discounts, but it has used them more liberally in recent quarters to offload old merchandise and styles that weren't resonating with shoppers. During its fiscal third quarter, margins fell by 2.9 percentage points, due primarily to higher tariffs and the bigger markdowns, it said at the time. Abercrombie & Fitch shares dropped more than 18% in morning trading after the retailer cut the high end of its guidance despite posting what it called \"record\" quarter-to-date sales. It's now expecting full-year sales to grow \"at least 6%,\" down from a prior range of between 6% and 7%. It anticipates its operating margin, a closely watched metric on Wall Street, will be around 13%, compared to a previously expected range of between 13% and 13.5%. The company expects earnings per share to be between $10.30 and $10.40, trimmed from prior guidance of between $10.20 and $10.50. \"Our team remained on offense across product, voice, and experience, resulting in record quarter-to-date net sales through fiscal December, aligned with our expectations,\" CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. \"Importantly, we delivered balanced growth across our regions, brands, and channels.\"Birkenstock, which didn't provide specific holiday-quarter guidance last year, said it expects sales in the quarter ended Dec. 31 to grow 11% to €402 million ($470 million). Shares rose about 2% in early trading.Savers Value Village saw sales grow 8.4% during its holiday quarter, with comparable sales up 5.4%, excluding the impact of an extra week the company had in its calendar. Despite relatively strong growth, the company only reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 adjusted net income and EBITDA outlooks. Shares were slightly higher in premarket trading. On the other side of the aisle, American Eagle said its holiday quarter was far better than expected, with quarter-to-date comparable sales through Jan. 3 \"up in the high single digits\" and sales trends positive across brands and channels. Comparable sales at its namesake banner grew by a low single digit percentage, while comps at its intimates line Aerie were up \"in the low twenties.\" American Eagle said the \"record\" season led it to raise its fourth quarter operating income to a range of $167 million to $170 million, up from $155 million to $160 million. \"Momentum continued in the fourth quarter with record December sales fueled by the power of our brands, with particularly strong growth at Aerie and Offline and sequential growth at American Eagle,\" CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. \"Our customers embraced new product collections and responded to our latest marketing initiatives, with strength continuing in the post-holiday period.\" Even so, the company's stock dropped 9% on Monday.Five Below said quarter-to-date sales as of Jan. 3 rose 23.2%, while comparable sales climbed 14.5%. \"We are incredibly pleased with our holiday performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategies we have been executing this year. With our maniacal focus on the customer: the kid and the kid in all of us, we offered amazing, trend-right products at exceptional value and began to create a better-connected customer journey,\" CEO Winnie Park said in a news release. \"In combination with tight-knit collaboration and alignment throughout the company, we drove strong, broad-based results.\" The company is now expecting fiscal fourth quarter sales to be around $1.71 billion, up from a previous range of between $1.58 billion and $1.61 billion, as it roughly doubled its comparable sales outlook to 14%, up from between 6% and 8%. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $3.93 to $3.98, up from previous guidance of between $3.34 to $3.52. Five Below expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.95 and $4, up from a prior range of between $3.36 to $3.54 per share. The company's shares slid about 1% in morning trading.The early results, which were announced ahead of the annual ICR conference in Orlando, Florida, show what many analysts had expected for the holiday shopping season. There will continue to be standouts with strong growth, but across the board, Wall Street largely anticipates results will be solid without massive, widespread gains in consumer spending. The National Retail Federation previously forecasted retail sales in November and December would rise between 3.7% and 4.2% compared to 2024. That's solid growth, but when higher prices from tariffs are taken into account, some analysts expect volume growth to be largely flat. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump will face an important obstacle — from within his own party — as he seeks to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Sunday he will block any Trump appointees to the central bank, including for the new chair, in light of revelations over the weekend that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential perjury charges.\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" he added.That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate.Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the \"one big beautiful bill\" spending package last year. Tillis is retiring from the Senate when his term ends.Powell's position isn't the only one at stake.Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed.\"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said.Tillis isn't the only banking panel member to criticize Trump over the move.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell \"a dangerous man\" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a \"sock puppet\" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" Warren said in a statement.While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he can stay on as governor until 2028. He has not indicated yet whether he will do so.The White House has been conducting an extensive search for the new chair, with the candidate field whittled down to five. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.",

Trump said there will be \"serious retaliation\" after two US Army soldiers and an interpreter were killed in Syria on Saturday, and three other Americans were wounded.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said in a social media post on Monday that Microsoft will announce changes to ensure that Americans won't see rising utility bills as the company builds more data centers to meet rising artificial intelligence demand.\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks.\"Ahead of this year's midterm elections, President Trump is trying to find ways to lower prices for consumers, as the effects of tariffs he imposed last year on goods imported to the U.S. ripple across the economy. In December, Trump announced a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for U.S soldiers. Earlier this month he demanded the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage bonds with the hope of reducing mortgage rates.Meanwhile, the biggest tech companies are rapidly constructing power-hungry data centers and telling Wall Street that they'll be bolstering their capital expenditures as the AI boom continues. Last week Meta announced agreements with three nuclear power companies for a data center in Ohio.Trump congratulated Microsoft on its efforts to keep prices in check, suggesting that other companies will make similar commitments.\"First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills,\" Trump wrote on Monday.Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Utilities charged U.S. consumers 6% more for electricity in August from a year earlier, including in states with many data centers, CNBC reported in November. Microsoft is paying close to attention to the impact of its data centers on local residents. \"I just want you to know we are doing everything we can, and I believe we're succeeding, in managing this issue well, so that you all don't have to pay more for electricity because of our presence,\" Brad Smith, the company's president and vice chair, said at a September town hall meeting in Wisconsin, where Microsoft is building an AI data center. While Microsoft is moving forward with some facilities, the company withdrew plans for a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, amid loud opposition to its efforts there. The project would would have been located 20 miles away from a data center in the village of Mount Pleasant.WATCH: Meta signs nuclear energy deals with Oklo, Vistra, and TerraPower to support its AI ambitionswatch now",

    "body": "Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke speaks after he was named among three U.S. economists awarded the 2022 Nobel Economics Prize, during a news conference at the Brookings Institution in Washington, October 10, 2022.Ken Cedeno | ReutersA chorus of previous Federal Reserve chairs, Treasury secretaries and prominent economists came together Monday to support Jerome Powell as the central bank leader faces potential perjury allegations from the Justice Department.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" a statement backed by more than a dozen signatories said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,\" it continued. \"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.\"watch nowAmong the signers of the statement were former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan among with former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner, Robert Rubin and Jacob Lew. Economists such as Glenn Hubbard, Kenneth Rogoff and Jared Bernstein also signed on.Powell on Sunday confirmed that he'd been notified from the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., that he is the subject of a probe into statements he made to Congress last June. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell answered questions regarding the massive renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in the nation's capital.At the time, President Donald Trump and other officials used cost overruns to intensify their criticism of Powell. Trump threatened to fire the Fed chair but backed off. It's not clear that the president would have the authority to remove Powell, with an unrelated case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook set for a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court next week that also addresses the president's power over the central bank.\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the statement said.Jonathan Kantner, former assistant U.S. attorney general, told CNBC on Monday that the bar for convicting someone in cases like these is \"very high\" particularly if there's a sense that the prosecution is politically motivated. Trump has been a longtime critic of Powell as he has pushed the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank approved three reductions in 2025.In a statement Sunday, Powell alleged that the accusations are a pretext to remove him from office. If that is established, it would \"set into motion a whole bunch of other legal disputes,\" Kantner said. \"This could get quite messy.\"CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.Correction: Jonathan Kantner is a former assistant U.S. attorney general. An earlier version misspelled his name.",

    "body": "ReutersSen. Mark Kelly on Monday sued the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alleging the Trump administration's efforts to punish the Arizona Democrat for his participation in a video to U.S. troops violate the Constitution.The federal civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was filed one week after Hegseth said his department would cut Kelly's military retirement pay in response to the video.The government's actions \"trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence,\" Kelly's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, which was also filed against the U.S. Navy Department and its secretary, John Phelan.\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" the lawyers wrote.The legal complaint alleges that the defendants violated Kelly's right to freedom of speech, as well as his protection under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause,\" which prevents executive action against members of Congress for their legislative conduct. The suit also alleges infringements of Kelly's due process rights and the separation of powers, among other violations.A Pentagon official told CNBC in a statement that the department is aware of the lawsuit, but that its policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation.The video at the center of the fight featured Kelly and five other congressional Democrats delivering a message addressed to U.S. troops and members of the intelligence community.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly said in the 90-second video, which was first posted on social media on Nov. 18.It was shared as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs.Members of Congress, including some Republicans, had questioned the legality of those deadly strikes, which were made without congressional authorization. The attacks have continued, killing 123 people since early September, according to The New York Times.The other lawmakers in the video, who all served in the military or in U.S. intelligence, each made a similar statement about troops being allowed to refuse unlawful orders.But Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, is the only one who formally retired from service, and therefore remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Days later, Hegseth slammed the video as \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" while labeling its participants the \"Seditious Six.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

OpenAI purchased Torch for roughly $60 million, according to a source familiar with the deal who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.Torch was building a \"unified medical memory\" for artificial intelligence that aimed to bring a patient's health data, which is typically siloed and stored across a number of different vendors and formats, into one place. Torch's employees will join OpenAI as part of the acquisition, the companies said.  \"I can't imagine a better next chapter than to now get to put our technology and ideas in the hands of the hundreds of millions of people who already use ChatGPT for health questions every week,\" Torch CEO Ilya Abyzov wrote in a post on X.

OpenAI's acquisition of Torch comes just days after it unveiled ChatGPT Health, a new experience that allows users connect their medical records and wellness apps to the AI chatbot. The company also announced several enterprise-grade products for health-care organizations. Some of its initial partners include large health systems like HCA Healthcare.  In December, OpenAI hired Google's Albert Lee to lead corporate development, a signal that the company will continue to hunt for M&A targets that can help it gain an edge over rivals like Google and Anthropic.

    "body": "Tech investors are sounding out how the U.S. taking Greenland would affect the viability of critical and rare earth minerals mining there, CNBC has learned, as Washington ramps up its pursuit of the Arctic island.Greenland has found itself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm over the past week as the U.S. has threatened to annex the self-governing Danish territory, citing national security concerns. Commercial opportunities have also come into the spotlight.In the past week, Critical Metals Corp, a company with a mining project in development on the Arctic island, has fielded questions from tech investors about how the U.S. acquiring Greenland would impact that asset and its development strategy, CEO Tony Sage told CNBC. The NASDAQ-listed company's stock is up 116% since the start of 2026.The project is in the early stages of building a plant to extract heavy rare earth elements (HREE), which can be used to provide heat resistance and magnetic stability in advanced technology ranging from EVs to AI data center infrastructure.Sage said U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Greenland had generated additional \"buzz\" for the project from investors. Without naming specific shareholders, he said Critical Metals Corp backers included those who invest in Magnificent Seven U.S. tech companies.Last week, the CEO of Amaroq, a mining company with projects in Greenland, told CNBC it was having discussions with U.S. government bodies about potential investment opportunities in the territory.The White House has said it's \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland, though it hasn't ruled out military action to acquire the territory, ahead of planned talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials. Mining in GreenlandInterest in critical minerals and rare earth mining in Greenland from tech investors has picked up in the past year. In January 2025, Trump reasserted his desire to acquire the territory — a massive, strategically-placed island with a population of just 57,000 — ahead of taking office.Amaroq chief Eldur Ólafsson said the company had seen an increase in attention from investors, including tech investors, over the last 12 months, in an interview with CNBC last week, as geopolitical tensions brought supply chains for critical minerals into focus.In November, the company said that \"commercial levels\" of germanium and gallium, critical minerals that are crucial for building advanced AI chips, were present in a mining project it owns in Greenland. \"When Trump put tariffs on China, the first two metals China stopped exporting were germanium and gallium,\" Ólafsson told CNBC. \"Why? Because you need it in AI, you need it in defense, you need it in tech, it's absolutely critical.\"watch nowChina's export ban on several rare earth minerals in 2025 highlighted to tech investors the challenge of the country's dominance in the space, said Critical Metals Corp's Sage. \"The heavy rare earths, which include Yttrium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium, and Gallium are the minerals that generate the most interest,\" he told CNBC. \"These are the materials that are essential for defence technologies, robotics, semiconductors and aerospace applications. We can't fly rockets into space, build nuclear submarines or next-generation fighter jets without these materials.\"Sage added that Critical Metals Corp had \"strong relationships\" with the governments of both Greenland and the U.S. and did not expect its plans to change.The company's stock surged 62% in a day in October after Reuters reported the U.S. Government was considering buying a stake. It shed the gains to finish 2025 up 2% for the year.Others are more skeptical about whether Greenland's critical and rare earth minerals can significantly reduce the West's dependence on China, which produced 70% of rare earths in 2024, according to Statista. \"Getting rare earths from exploration to the mighty magnet involves five to six distinct stages — and right now, what's in Greenland is still only in the exploration stage,\" Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director at industry group the Critical Minerals Institute, told CNBC.\"Rare earths in Greenland won't materially move markets in the next decade,\" she added.",

    "body": "watch nowApple is joining forces with Google to power its artificial intelligence features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. The multiyear partnership will lean on Google's Gemini and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models, according to a joint statement obtained by CNBC's Jim Cramer.\"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,\" Apple said in a statement Monday.The models will continue to run on Apple devices and the company's private cloud compute, the companies added. Apple declined to comment on the terms of the deal. Google referred CNBC to the joint statement. In August, Bloomberg reported that Apple was in early talks with Google to use a custom Gemini model to power a new iteration of Siri. The news outlet later reported that Apple was planning to pay about $1 billion a year to utilize Google AI.The deal is another major indicator of growing trust in Google's accelerating AI agenda and comeback against OpenAI. In 2025, the search giant logged its best year since 2009 and surpassed Apple in market capitalization last week for the first time since 2019. Google already pays Apple billions each year to be the default search engine on iPhones. But that lucrative partnership briefly came into question after Google was found to hold an illegal internet search monopoly. In September, a judge ruled against a worst-case scenario outcome that could have forced Google to divest its Chrome browser business. The decision also allowed Google to continue to make deals such as the one with Apple.Read more CNBC tech newsAlphabet hits $4 trillion market capitalizationMalaysia and Indonesia block Elon Musk's Grok due to nonconsensual sexual contentGoogle bolsters bet on AI-powered commerce with new platform for shopping agentsAre we in an AI bubble?

Google briefly touched above a $4 trillion market value.Apple has mostly stood on the sidelines of the AI frenzy that's swept up Wall Street since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Hyperscalers Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft have shelled out billions on AI products, tools and infrastructure for their customers.That's amped up the pressure on the iPhone maker to deliver an impressive Siri AI voice upgrade, which it delayed last year until 2026, despite running ads for the product.\"It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year,\" the company said in a statement at the time.Apple currently partners with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence, specifically for complicated queries that can tap into the AI model's world knowledge. It's unclear what the Google partnership means for the ChatGPT integration in the future.The iPhone maker told CNBC that it isn't making any changes to the agreement. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Google has made steady progress on its AI agenda, introducing its upgraded Gemini 3 model late last year. In October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company's cloud segment signed more deals worth over $1 billion through the third quarter of 2025 than the previous two years combined.

You know we have so many that want it. I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,\" Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday. \"They're playing too cute,\" he added. His comments come shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Exxon were down less than 1% in morning trading Monday.Speaking alongside several other American oil executives on Friday, Woods said Exxon would need to see \"some pretty significant changes\" if it was to reenter the country for a third time. Venezuela seized Exxon's and ConocoPhillips' assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell focused on the $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and his related testimony to Congress, he said on Sunday evening.Powell said the probe is the result of long-standing frustration by President Donald Trump over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as quickly and as much as the president has demanded. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.Powell warned that the outcome of the investigation will determine the future of the central bank's decisions.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. Stock futures fell on the heels of Powell's statement.Powell said the Department of Justice on Friday served the Fed \"with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\"That testimony concerned, in part, a multiyear project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" he said.The threat of indictment, Powell said, \"is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings.\"U.S. President Donald Trump looks at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holding a document during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Reuters\"It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project,\" he said. \"Those are pretexts.\"\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy,\" Powell said in his statement. \"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike,\" Powell said. \"In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment,\" he said. \"Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\" A DOJ spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC, without saying the comment was about Powell, said, \"The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

A person familiar with the investigation told CNBC that they would not dispute the idea that the probe of Powell is related to the building renovation and his testimony to Congress.The investigation is being overseen by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the newspaper. That office is led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a former New York state prosecutor and Fox News host, who was appointed to her post by Trump.Trump, in an interview with NBC News on Sunday evening, said, \"I don't know anything about it,\" referring to the criminal probe of Powell.\"But he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump told the news outlet.Trump has repeatedly blasted Powell for the Fed not cutting interest rates as much and as quickly as the president has demanded since entering the White House in January 2025.But the president told NBC on Sunday that the DOJ's subpoenas do not have anything to do with interest rates, according to the outlet.\"No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way,\" Trump said. \"What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's got.\"When asked Monday if the president directed the DOJ to open the investigation, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said no, and that Trump has a First Amendment right to criticize the Fed.Trump on Dec. 29 said, \"We're thinking about bringing a suit against Powell for incompetence\" in connection with the renovation of Fed buildings.\"It's going to end up costing more than $4 billion,\" the president said. \"Highest price of construction per square foot in the history of the world.\" Trump also said that day that \"I would love to fire him.\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersThe probe came to light nearly six months after Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., first said she had referred Powell to the DOJ for the potential crimes of perjury and false statements to federal officials in connection with his testimony about the renovation project for the Fed's headquarters.\"I laid out, in detail, how Jerome Powell lied under oath to Congress and misrepresented facts in official communications to senior administration officials, including OMB Director Russell Vought,\" Luna said in a tweet Sunday. \"Unelected bureaucrats do not get a free pass. This is exactly why oversight exists, and I am thankful the @DOJ  is taking this seriously. No one is above the law.Trump has made no secret of his intention to remove Powell as chair after his term expires in May. The two leading contenders are believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the current director of the National Economic Council.Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, blasted the investigation of Powell and said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, \"until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" the senator said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Trump's \"assault on the Fed's independence continues,\" adding the president is threatening the strength and stability of the U.S. economy.\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Jay Powell and the Fed aren't the reason Trump's economy and his poll numbers are in the toilet. If he's looking for the person who caused that he should look in the mirror.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, echoed Tillis.\"As Donald Trump prepares to nominate a new Fed Chair, he wants to push Jerome Powell off the Fed Board for good and install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank,\" Warren said in a statement.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,\" Warren said. \"This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.\"Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, in a note to clients Sunday, wrote, \"President Trump is trying to bring criminal charges against Powell related to his testimony before Congress about the Fed's headquarters renovation.\"\"Powell may protest by staging a sit-in. His term as Chair is up in May, but his term as a governor isn't up until January 2028,\" Jacobsen wrote.\"With the political pressure on the Fed, he may choose to stay on as a governor out of spite. It would deprive President Trump of the ability to stack the board with another appointee,\" Jacobsen wrote. \"Stephen Miran's term is up in January 2026 and that may be the only vacancy Trump gets to fill. It would be unconventional for Powell to stay on, but everything these days is unconventional.\"Trump nominated Powell to the Fed chair position in 2017; he was confirmed in 2018.But almost from the onset of Powell's term, Trump has repeatedly badgered the Fed chair about interest rates. At various times, Trump has called Fed officials \"boneheads\" and once referred to Powell as a golfer who cannot putt.Those criticisms intensified during Trump's second term, as he hectored the central bank to cut rates for months, even after it implemented three consecutive quarter percentage point reductions beginning in September.During that time, Trump installed his handpicked choice, Miran, as a Fed governor and has sought to remove another governor, Lisa Cook, from the board over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.Cook denies those claims, which were made in the form of criminal referrals to the DOJ by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has been an attack dog against perceived enemies of Trump, who appointed Pulte to his post.The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on a case challenging Cook's removal later in January.Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI and head of its global policy and central bank strategy team, in a note to clients on the probe of Powell, said, \"We are stunned by this deeply disturbing development which came out of the blue after a period in which tensions between Trump and the Fed seemed to be contained.\"\"We expect the dollar, bonds and stocks to all fall in Monday trading in a sell-America trade similar to that in April last year at the peak of the tariff shock and earlier threat to Powell's position as Fed chair, with global investors applying a higher risk premium to US assets,\" Guha said. \"Gold and other safe havens should rally.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Eamon Javers, and Garrett Downs contributed to this article",

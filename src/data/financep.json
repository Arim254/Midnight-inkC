    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party (GOP) member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he has canceled a fresh military attack on Venezuela, saying the two countries \"are working well together,\" on rebuilding the nation's oil and gas infrastructure.Writing on Truth Social on Friday, Trump noted Venezuela's release of \"large numbers of political prisoners\" which he called \"a very important and smart gesture.\"\"Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,\" Trump said.In a press conference on Jan. 3, Trump had suggested it was unlikely a second attack on Venezuela would be deemed necessary due to what he called the success of the first operation. \"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so,\" he told reporters at the time. \"So we were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so. We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week. On Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country. Since Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure. In his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday. Chevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems. Venezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.On Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article. ",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday his administration will take action on Greenland \"whether they like it or not,\" further escalating his rhetoric as he pushes to acquire the Danish territory for the U.S.\"I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.The comments came during a meeting with oil executives to discuss the prospect of doing business in Venezuela. Less than a week earlier, the U.S. military invaded the oil-rich South American nation and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro.Trump has long sought to take over Greenland, primarily citing the Arctic island's importance for U.S. national security. Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have pushed back, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. But the Trump administration nevertheless says it is currently weighing a range of options on Greenland, including utilizing the U.S. military or cutting a deal to purchase it from Denmark.Government officials have also mulled sending lump sums of cash to Greenlanders in order to sway them to join the U.S., Reuters reported Thursday.Asked on Friday how much those payments could be, Trump said, \"I'm not talking about money for Greenland, yet.\"\"I might talk about that, but right now we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" Trump said.\"Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\" he said.Trump said that while he is a \"big fan\" of Denmark, \"the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. [I'm] sure we had lots of boats go there also.\"\"So we're going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult,\" he said.The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, and it reportedly has the ability to expand its presence there if desired.But that isn't enough, Trump said.\"When we own it, we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way, you have to own it,\" he said.",

And we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired Thursday night.\"The cartels are running Mexico, it's very sad to watch and see what's happened to that country,\" Trump said.Trump's comment comes less than a week after U.S. forces struck Venezuela and captured its authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores. The Venezuelan government has said more than 100 people were killed in the military operation, which came after a monthslong pressure campaign against Maduro.The Trump administration has carried out 35 known strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, killing 115 individuals, according to The New York Times.A White House spokeswoman, when asked by CNBC about Trump's comment on Fox News, said, in an email, \"The administration is reasserting and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere, control migration, and stop drug trafficking.\"\"The President has many options at his disposal to continue to protect our homeland from illicit narcotics that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year,\"  the spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said.Trump previously floated the idea of executing attacks on Mexico.\"Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in November when asked if he would consider military action across the southern border.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum pushed back on Trump after that, saying there would be no U.S. military action in Mexico without her permission. This week, Sheinbaum condemned the U.S. capture of Maduro and reaffirmed her country's sovereignty.\"It is necessary to reaffirm that in Mexico the people rule, and that we are a free and sovereign country— cooperation, yes; subordination and intervention, no,\" Sheinbaum said, according to Reuters.Sheinbaum addressed Trump's latest remarks at a press conference on Friday, saying she would \"deepen coordination\" with the U.S.\" and that she asked her Secretary of Foreign Affairs Juan Ramón de la Fuente to meet with the U.S. Department of State if necessary.\"We are going to strengthen communication,\" Sheinbaum said, according to a translated version of her remarks provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"Two or three days ago, Secretary [Marco] Rubio himself spoke about the good coordination on security matters that exists with Mexico... we will further strengthen the relationship and the exchange of information,\" Sheinbaum said.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseThe Trump administration over the past week has also threatened military action in Cuba, Colombia, and Greenland, prompting backlash even from within the ranks of congressional Republicans.On Thursday, the Senate passed the first phase of a measure to block Trump from further military action in Venezuela.Five Senate Republicans voted in favor of the measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, indicating it has enough bipartisan support to clear a final vote.One of those Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said that she supported Trump's removal of Maduro. But she also said that further action would require congressional approval.\"When the president raises the issue, as he has with not only Venezuela, but Greenland, of military force being used, then it does implicate the War Powers Act and Congress's constitutional role,\" Collins said.Correction: Cilia Flores is Nicolás Maduro's wife.

    "body": "Nearly a million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2025, per the U.K. Office for National Statistics.Hiraman | E+ | Getty ImagesYoung people are struggling to score their first jobs, and it might be because they're just not ready to enter the workforce, after missing out on critical social development during the Covid-19 pandemic. Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people \"aren't work ready\" when they enter full-time jobs after school. \"Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work.\" Generation Lockdown U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. \"You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,\" Leonard said. Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are \"so core to being work-ready,\" and Gen Z \"missed out.\"Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in \"sharp decline.\" \"There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,\" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. \"Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were \"critical\" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. \"We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,\" she said. In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of \"human-skills\" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. Ask for jobs in-person Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. \"It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,\" Leonard said. Walk into your local shop and ask for a job, advises Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust. Timnewman | E+ | Getty Images\"Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'\" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. \"You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,\" Leonard added. ",

    "body": "An Imax private screening for the movie \"First Man\" at an AMC theater in New York on Oct. 10, 2018.Lars Niki | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe theatrical industry is in flux — and one stock is rising above the rest.Imax saw its shares jump more than 44% in 2025, even before the company announced that it had generated a record $1.28 billion at the global box office for the year. Those ticket sales marked a more than 40% increase over 2024 and were 13% higher than its previous record set in 2019.Meanwhile, shares of fellow theatrical stocks AMC, Cinemark and Marcus Theatres cratered in 2025. AMC was down more than 60%, Cinemark's stock fell 25% and Marcus Corp., which operates theaters and hotel chains, slumped around 28%.The sharp declines on Wall Street come as theater operators struggle to grapple with massive changes in the industry.Domestic ticket sales have rebounded from the record lows posted during the Covid pandemic, but remain about 25% below the the record-breaking $11.8 billion collected in 2018. The 2025 box office fell short of the $9 billion analysts had projected heading into the year, signaling to industry watchdogs that post-pandemic hurdles could be more permanent than anticipated.\"In an environment where consumer spending headwinds and economic concerns forced consumers to be choiceful with their entertainment spending, streaming services continue to represent an attractive option,\" Eric Wold, executive director of equity research at Texas Capital Securities, told CNBC.At the same time that consumer habits have shifted toward the home entertainment market, Hollywood is producing fewer films. A combination of Wall Street penny-pinching, studio mergers and lingering production shutdowns from the pandemic and dual labor strikes has led to a significant drop-off in the number of movies hitting theaters. \"I think investors are still struggling with, and frankly, what everyone within the industry is still trying to figure out is, what is the real new normal for box office?\" said Robert Fishman, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson.The winnowing of theatrical has left Imax ahead of the pack. Move toward premiumWhen the theatrical slate is thin, Imax benefits, because when moviegoers do decide to leave their couches they are opting more and more for premium large format experiences.In 2025, more than 16% of tickets sold for domestic showtimes were for these types of theaters, according to data from EntTelligence. That's up from 15% in 2024 and 13.8% in 2023. Often called PLFs, premium large format auditoriums are considered an elevated viewing experience, with bigger screens and higher-quality sound systems and seating options — and they come with higher ticket prices. In 2025, general movie tickets averaged $13.29 apiece, while PLF tickets went for around $17.65 each, EntTelligence data showed. For comparison, premium tickets in 2024 averaged around $16.88 apiece. As Hollywood shifts toward producing more big-budget blockbuster features — while medium-to-low-budget films are more often sent to streaming — PLF screens will become increasingly important.After all, the films that benefit the most from PLF ticket sales have been Hollywood's biggest releases, as audiences want to see explosive action movies and dazzling spectacles in the most state-of-the-art locations. ScreenX is the world's first multi-projection cinema with an immersive 270 degree field of view.CJ 4DPLEXOn the docket for 2026 is Disney's \"Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" Universal and Christopher Nolan's \"The Odyssey,\" Netflix and Greta Gerwig's \"Narnia\" and Warner Bros. and Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Three.\" All of these films were shot with Imax film cameras and will have theatrical releases on Imax screens. The company has forecast its 2026 global box office haul at a new record of $1.4 billion. \"We see no signs of slowing down given a very promising slate ahead and the consistency of our market share gains, as filmmakers, studios, and audiences worldwide continue to gravitate toward the Imax experience,\" said Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax, in a statement Wednesday.As of the end of September, Imax had more than 1,700 locations and a backlog of 478 contracts to build Imax screens. Notably, Imax screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.Putting up profitsAMC, Cinemark and Marcus all have premium large format movie screens as part of their suite of theaters as well and have invested in creating more of these spaces in their cinemas. But the chains are playing a game of catch-up. AMC, in addition to its existing partnership with Imax, has plans to add more Dolby Cinema theaters to its U.S.-based locations as well as Screen X and 4DX auditoriums globally. Cinemark, too, made investments in the last year to add more Screen X theaters to its portfolio.Of course, these upgrades can be expensive. In the case of AMC, renovations prior to the pandemic saddled the company with billions in debt, which was exacerbated during Covid-related shutdowns. The company is still dealing with this debt load.Working in Imax's favor is the fact that the company is notably asset-light, meaning it has minimized its ownership of physical assets like buildings by leveraging its technology and partnering with other companies. Instead of costly real estate leases, Imax makes deals with cinema chains to install its equipment into their auditoriums and then takes a share of the box office receipts for films screened in those theaters.AMC, Cinemark, Marcus and other theater operators, on the other hand, have the financial burden of rent and utility payments, which are only partially offset by ticket sales that they split with studios. Concessions — popcorn, soda and specialty food — have become the means for these businesses to drum up enough funds to cover expenses.But, if the production slate isn't strong and cinemas don't have enough content to draw in moviegoers, then profitability is at risk. In the first quarter of 2025, all three cinema stocks posted net losses. Marcus and Cinemark rebounded to profitability in the second and third quarter, as the calendar of films improved, while AMC posted two more periods in the red.Imax, on the other hand, was profitable in all three quarters. Through the first nine months of 2025, Imax reported net income of $43 million, up 67% from the same period in 2024. The theater stocks will all report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks as earnings reports roll out. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump in a social media post Thursday evening indirectly revealed data from Friday's market-moving nonfarm payrolls count, an apparent violation of long-standing federal policy on statistical releases.In a Truth Social post around 9 p.m. ET, the president indicated that private sector payrolls had expanded by 654,000 for the full year of 2025, a total that would have included Friday's jobs count for December. Office of Management and Budget policy prohibits executive branch officials from commenting on such releases early and in fact forbids public statements until 30 minutes after the release. Presidents can be briefed on official jobs figures ahead of the release.A White House official conceded, however, that \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information. The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.\"The official further chided the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy\" and instead urged a focus on how \"President Trump's policies are laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.\"The Trump post drew a distinction between private and government job growth, with the latter down 181,000 for 2025.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' December jobs report, posted by U.S. President Donald Trump on his Truth Social account, about 12 hours before the figures were publicly released, is seen in this screenshot obtained on January 9, 2026. @realdonaldtrump | Via ReutersFriday's jobs data release went on to show that nonfarm payrolls increased 50,000 for December, all but 2,000 of which came from the private sector. The figures, while slightly less than official economists' estimates, assuaged concerns about a steeper drop in employment. Stock futures trended higher following the data.While Trump's post would not allow traders to calculate the exact payrolls figure because of lack of data on revisions, they could have gleaned a rough estimation of the figure and possibly ruled out a December job-loss scenario that would have spooked markets.Trump once telegraphed somewhat a positive jobs figure in his first term, drawing criticism.",

    "body": "watch nowNew video that appears to show Renee Nicole Good in her car right before she was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis was posted Friday on social media by the site Alpha News.The 47-second-long video appears to have been taken by a phone held by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fired at the 37-year-old Good on Wednesday as she drove her SUV toward him on a residential street.The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familar with the investigation told MS Now.\"Ohhhh!\" the agent apparently moans, as the Honda Pilot lurches by him.\"F---ing bitch,\" the agent apparently mutters after firing at Good.Video still shows Renee Good moments before an ICE agent opened fire and killed her.Source: Alpha NewsVice President JD Vance reposted the video on his X account.\"Watch this, as hard as it is,\" Vance wrote. \"Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn't hit by a car, wasn't being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self defense.\"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and other Democrats have strongly disputed the claim by officials in the Trump administration that Good was trying to intentionally hit the ICE agent. Some observers have said Good, a mother of three, was trying to swerve around him after being approached by other ICE agents, who were directing her to get out of the SUV.Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin, whose department oversees ICE, said in a statement Friday, \"This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement.\"\"The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defense. The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,\" McLaughlin said.The new video begins with the ICE agent exiting his car and walking over to Good's SUV, which is behind his, and blocking the road, as sirens blare in the background.The agent then walks over to the driver's door, where the video clearly shows Good's face through the open window.\"That's fine, dude, I'm not mad,\" Good tells him on the video. \"I'm not mad at any of you.\"There is a dog in the back of the SUV.Another woman, who was standing next to Good's car, says to the agent, \"Show your face, big boy, show your face.\"As the agent moves to the rear of Good's SUV to take video of its license plate, the other woman says, \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning.\"\"Just so you know. It'll be the same plate when you come talk to us later,\" the woman says, holding up her own phone with its camera lenses pointed at the agent. \"That's fine. U.S. citizen, former f---ing veteran, disabled veteran, you want to come at us? You want to come at us?\" the woman says. \"I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead,\" she says.At that point, another ICE agent approaches the driver's side of Good's SUV, saying, \"Out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the f---ing car. Get out of the car.\"The second woman walks over to Good's car as if to get into the front passenger seat, the video reveals.\"Drive baby, drive!\" the woman says to Good as she grabs the door handle.But the SUV backs up slightly and then moves forward.The agent fires within a second or two of that movement toward him.This is breaking news.

    "body": "The Camp Jeep outdoor terrain at the New York International Auto Shown on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Stellantis is scrapping its plug-in hybrid electric Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivan amid slowing EV sales, quality issues and weakened federal fuel economy requirements. The automaker on Friday said the decision to end production of the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica was a result of waning customer demand and the need to focus on \"more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range‑extended vehicles.\"\"Stellantis continually evaluates its product strategy to meet evolving customer needs and regulatory requirements. With customer demand shifting, Stellantis will phase out plug‑in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year,\" the company said in an emailed statement.The decision is an about-face for the automaker, which has touted its U.S. sales leadership of the models for years. In 2024, then-Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa — who is now CEO of Stellantis — said the SUV brand planned to sell 160,000 to 170,000 PHEVs that year, and the company said it represented 41% of U.S. PHEV sales.watch nowAside from sales, Stellantis has been using PHEVs as a way to offset its production of gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs to attempt to meet federal fuel economy standards and avoid penalties. The goal has become less urgent as the Trump administration eliminates or weakens aspects of those rules. Chrysler first introduced its PHEV minivan in 2016. Jeep debuted the Wrangler PHEV, which it called a \"4xe,\" in 2020, followed by a Grand Cherokee version in 2021.PHEVs feature traditional internal combustion engines, but also have an all-electric range when charged like an EV. They have largely been viewed as a transitional technology from traditional vehicles to EVs; however, they are quite costly because of their two different propulsion systems. The cancellation also comes amid a recall of the Jeep SUVs due to fire risk — the latest in a string of issues for the vehicles. The company is also reevaluating its product portfolio as part of its U.S. turnaround strategy.A 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee.JeepThe company said the recall, which included a stop-sale of the vehicles, \"is in no way related\" to the cancellation of the vehicles. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf late last month told CNBC the brand was evaluating its electrification strategy since the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs and PHEVs in September.He said Jeep still had vehicles on the ground that it would continue to sell, but \"all of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out, and what becomes steady state for 4xe and [battery] EVs in general.\"A Jeep spokeswoman said the brand will continue to offer all-electric SUVs such as the Wagoneer S and Recon, which was officially revealed late last year.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump met Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolás Maduro.Exxon CEO Darren Woods, ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance and Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson attended. Executives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon were also present among others. Trump said oil companies will spend at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. The U.S. will provide security and protection so \"they get their money back and make a very nice return,\" he said. The U.S. will decide which oil companies enter Venezuela, the president said. The White House will \"cut a deal with the companies\" Friday or shortly thereafter, he said.   \"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said.The White House called the meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground, so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen,\" Exxon's Woods said. Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters — our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesThree Democratic senators are calling on Apple and Google to suspend the X and Grok apps from their stores, at least until owner Elon Musk disallows them from letting users create and share nonconsensual, explicit images and depictions of child sexual abuse.In an open letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Friday, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico said the tech giants should, \"immediately remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company's Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, addresses these disturbing and likely illegal activities.\"\"Turning a blind eye to X's egregious behavior would make a mockery of your moderation practices,\" they wrote, adding that a failure to take action would \"undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones.\"Musk's xAI, the developer of Grok and parent of social media platform X, responded to CNBC's request for comment with an automated reply. Google and Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Grok and X have been letting users easily generate and widely share \"deepfake\" explicit, sexualized content that includes people who never gave permission for their images to be used in such manner. Grok has also been used to generate images that denigrate people on the basis of their race or ethnicity.In one recent example, as The Times of London reported, \"A descendant of Holocaust survivors was 'digitally stripped'\" by Grok after users prompted the AI tool to generate an image of her in a bikini standing outside of Auschwitz. The issues have sparked widespread criticism and regulatory probes by foreign governments in Europe, Malaysia, Australia and India. However, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have yet to say whether they will investigate xAI.On Jan. 3, Musk and X issued statements saying that \"anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\" Apple and Google both have stringent guidelines for app developers that would require them to prevent the uploading and sharing of images depicting child sexual abuse, and other explicit or harmful content. Social media and messaging apps including Tumblr and Telegram have been previously suspended by the Apple app store for failures to filter a variety of inappropriate content. On Friday, X reportedly made Grok AI image generation features available for use by paying subscribers only. However, Grok's standalone app and website still allowed users to prompt Grok to digitally undress, sexualize or degrade people without first obtaining consent to use their photos or clips.CNN reported that Grok's recent feature updates, and relative lack of safeguards, were demanded by Musk. Three xAI staffers who worked on the company's safety team announced on X that they were leaving after Musk made the demands, the report said.In the midst of the backlash, xAI said this week that it raised a $20 billion funding round from investors including Nvidia and Cisco Investments, as well as longtime Musk company backers Valor Equity Partners, Stepstone Group, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi's MGX and Baron Capital Group.WATCH: XAI closes $20 billion funding roundwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowMortgage rates fell sharply on Friday, a day after President Donald Trump said on social media that he is instructing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds. \"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he said in the Truth Social post.The rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped 22 basis points to 5.99%, matching the low from Feb. 2, 2023, according to Mortgage News Daily. Fannie Mae and Freddie, which are in government conservatorship, do not originate home loans. They buy loans from lenders, bundle them into mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, and sell them to investors — thereby replenishing lender funds for new loans and keeping interest rates lower and more stable for homebuyers.Purchasing more mortgage-backed bonds or securities does move mortgage rates lower. In the first two months of the Covid pandemic, as markets reeled, the Federal Reserve purchased $580 billion in agency MBS. It then continued buying more throughout the year. From March 2020 through June 2021, the Federal Reserve increased its agency MBS holdings from $1.4 trillion to $2.3 trillion, according to the Dallas Fed. The Federal Reserve also lowered its own lending rate to zero. The combination brought the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage to record lows, hitting just 2.75% at the start of 2021, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"How big a deal is $200 billion? This depends on a few factors, but the reaction in the MBS market is enough to tell you that it matters,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily which tracks rates closely and is already seeing them fall just from the news of the announcement.While it is still not known how quickly this would start and how long it will take, analysts are predicting where mortgage rates could end up; most put the drop somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points, some even lower. \"We believe that $200bn of MBS purchases could drive a ~10-25bps reduction in mortgage rates, potentially reducing the current 30-year headline mortgage rate to roughly 6.0% (current 6.21%). While still elevated relative to the average outstanding mortgage rate of 4.4% and the 3.25% levels as recently as Jan 2022, this decline may provide a boost to both new construction demand and existing home turnover,\" analysts at UBS wrote.Put simply, if rates were to drop even to 5.9%, for someone buying the median-priced home — which is right around $425,000, according to the National Association of Realtors — using a 30-year fixed mortgage with a 20% down payment, the monthly payment would drop by $118. For some, that may not seem like a lot, but for first-time buyers on the edge of affordability, it could make a difference. They would still, however, need to save for the down payment, which is currently the biggest hurdle for most first-timers. Homebuilder stocks rallied on the news, but they were already buying down mortgage rates prior to this well into the 5% range. Their concerns lately have been more focused on increasing costs from tariffs and a continued labor shortage. That said, just the news of this could have an impact on buyer demand for the builders. \"I think psychologically it will help,\" said Ivy Zelman, executive vice president of research and securities at Zelman, a Walker & Dunlop company. \"I think that today, people that have been looking that didn't even know builders were offering mortgage rate buydowns might step into the market.\"But Zelman also points out that in the broader home market it's not just the mortgage rate, but overall affordability that is keeping buyers sidelined. Consumers are stretched, and home prices are close to 50% higher than they were pre-pandemic, ironically because of those record-low mortgage rates brought on by MBS purchases.\"This is not enough to really get the market going because we know people can't qualify even at 4.99%. They can say that the mortgage rates are going to go down to below 5, but we have people that still can't qualify at 4.99%, so I think there's more work to be done,\" Zelman said.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.This could also help builder margins, which have been shrinking lately because of higher costs.\"From a demand perspective, [it is] maybe a marginal benefit from the positive psychological impact on consumers,\" said John Lovallo, analyst at UBS. \"Bigger is the potential ability for builders to begin pulling back on incentives to some extent which would be very accretive to gross margins.\"The drop, however, could also help current homeowners to save on their monthly payments through a refinance. Rates have already been dropping steadily, with the 30-year fixed down from it's recent peak of 7.16% one year ago. Applications to refinance a home loan were already 133% higher year over year before this announcement, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The general rule of thumb is that a refinance is only worth the cost if you can save more than 75 basis points on a mortgage rate. This would add many more potential candidates to the refinance pool, especially those who took out their loans over the last two years. The vast majority of homeowners, however, still have rates below 4%. ",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. labor market ended 2025 on a soft note, with job creation in December less than expected, according to a report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nonfarm payrolls rose a seasonally adjusted 50,000 for the month, lower than the downwardly revised 56,000 in November and short of the Dow Jones estimate for 73,000. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, compared with the forecast for 4.5%. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons dropped to 8.4%, down 0.3 percentage point from November. The household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment figures, showed an increase of 232,000 while the labor force participation rate edged lower to 62.4%.The report presented a muddy view of the labor market, with companies reporting a low level of hiring but households showing employment gains. Stock market futures gained following the release while Treasury yields were stable.In addition, revisions brought totals down for the prior months. The November total saw a slight downward revision of 8,000 to the payrolls number, while October's loss was even more than originally reported, now at 173,000 compared with the prior estimate of 105,000.For the full year, payroll gains averaged 49,000 a month, compared with 168,000 in 2024, according to the BLS.\"The jobs report is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative aspects,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"We continue to see an environment where companies are slow to hire and slow to fire. The overarching takeaway in today's report is that there is more good news than bad in the first on-time jobs report in three months.\"watch nowPrior reports had been delayed due to the government shutdown, which saw data collection and reports suspended during the 43-day impasse.Restaurant and bar jobs led the month, rising 27,000, while health care added 21,000 and social assistance increased by 17,000. Retail reported a decline of 25,000. Government added just 2,000 jobs for the month.Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% for the month, in line with the forecast, although the annual increase of 3.8% was 0.2 percentage point higher than expected. The average workweek edged lower to 34.2 hours.Federal Reserve officials have been watching the jobs picture closely for guidance on the future path of interest rates.The annual payrolls gain of 584,000 for 2025 is the worst year outside of a recession since 2003, according to Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"It's fair to say that 2025 was a hiring recession in the United States,\" Long wrote. \"The United States is experiencing a jobless boom where growth is strong, but hiring is not. It's a great scenario for Wall Street, but an uneasy feeling on Main Street.\"Despite some clamoring for additional rate cuts on top of the three the Fed approved in the latter part of last year, the economy looked in fairly solid shape as a tumultuous year came to a close.The Atlanta Fed's rolling measure of incoming economic data is pointing to gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% annualized pace in the fourth quarter. That comes off a third quarter in which the broad growth measure rose at a 4.3% rate.In addition, consumers, who power two-thirds of the $31 trillion U.S. economy, spent heavily during the holiday season. Adobe estimates that online spending rose 6.8% from a year ago to a record-setting $257.8 billion.Markets expect the Fed to stay on hold for a period following the succession of cuts that began in September. The next reduction is not priced in until June, though that could change following the payrolls report.The report caps a tumultuous year for the BLS. President Donald Trump in August, angry over a weak payrolls report for July and large revisions to prior months, fired former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and replaced her with William J. Wiatrowski. In addition, the shutdown posed data collection challenges for the bureau. Markets expect the January report will present a cleaner view of the labor picture.watch now",

    "body": "Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Kermanshah, Iran on January 8, 2026. Kamran | Afp | Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader on Friday lashed out at anti-government protesters, saying they were \"vandals\" acting on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump by destroying public properties.In a broadcast on national television, reported by Reuters, Ali Khamenei warned Tehran would not tolerate \"mercenaries for foreigners.\"\"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,\" Khamenei said.  His comments came as the country of 92 million found itself largely cut off from the world on Friday, with authorities seeking to quell the sprawling protests by blacking out the internet.The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.The scale of the unrest makes it one of the most widespread demonstrations in recent years, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, with dozens reported killed and nearly 2,300 arrested or detained. HRANA, a U.S.-registered nonprofit, relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting. Iranian leader Ali Khamenei comments on the recent protests against economic conditions on Iranian State Television in the capital Tehran on January 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe protests have also revived concerns about possible American intervention. Trump said last week that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Jan 2.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani reportedly responded at the time by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region.Iran, which is a member of OPEC, is a major player in the global oil market.Oil prices were last seen trading higher as energy market participants continued to monitor concerns over the disruption in Iran. International benchmark Brent crude futures with March expiry traded up 0.9% at $62.52 a barrel on Friday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with February expiry stood at $58.29, up 0.9% for the session.— CNBC's April Roach and Anniek Bao contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Yuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty ImagesFor executives and founders who have gotten rich off one stock, sometimes it is possible to have too much of a good thing. While the tech stock boom has meant a windfall for employees at high-flying companies, it's risky to have too much of your net worth tied up in one stock. Some advisors ascribe to a 10% rule of thumb — meaning no one stock or asset should make up more than 10% of a portfolio.\"It represents both the biggest risk and biggest opportunity for that client,\" said Rob Romano, head of capital markets investor solutions at Merrill.Founders and long-time employees who want to diversify their portfolios can face steep capital gains taxes when they sell long-held stock in order to reinvest. Instead, they can contribute their shares to an exchange fund (not to be confused with ETFs). Exchange funds, also known as swap funds, pool shares from multiple investors, who receive a partnership interest or share of the fund. After a designated lock-up period — usually seven years — investors can redeem their shares for a diversified basket of stocks equal to their interest in the fund.While exchange funds became mainstream in the '70s, they've gained more popularity of late as the stock market puts up strong returns, boosted in particular by the rise of artificial intelligence. Eric Freedman, chief investment officer of Northern Trust's wealth management business, said the many publicly held tech companies are ramping up their equity compensation to compete with hot AI startups for talent.Exchange funds generally hold 80% of their assets in stocks and aim to mirror benchmark indexes like the S&P 500 or Russell 3000. The remaining 20% is required by the Internal Revenue Service to be held in non-security assets, with real estate being the most popular option.Steve Edwards, senior investment strategist for Morgan Stanley's wealth division, said he is seeing clients increasingly use exchange funds as a wealth transfer strategy.\"What exchange funds are helping us to do is to narrow the range of outcomes because a single stock will have a very wide range of outcomes,\" he said. \"Imagine you're 70 years old, and you have a stock that's been amazing, but then it becomes a dumpster fire and, essentially, you are not be able to pass to your heirs the legacy that you were hoping to.\" Still, getting clients to hedge their bets is often a hard proposition, Edwards said. \"People remember the blessing the stock has been to them and their family, and they're extrapolating forward that the blessing will continue,\" he said. \"What we found in our research and our work is that stocks that have outperformed actually tend to underperform more in the future.\"Clients usually contribute only a portion of their shares to an exchange fund to take some chips off the table, he said. Exchange funds only accept accredited investors worth more than $1 million or with more than $200,000 in earned income in the past two calendar years. And, the lock-up period comes with fine print: If an investor redeems before seven years, they lose the tax benefit and may incur steep fees. Instead of receiving a diversified basket of stocks, the investor typically gets back their original shares — up to the value of their interest in the fund.Scott Welch, chief investment officer at multi-family office Certuity, said he advises against exchange funds because of the lock-up period. There are more flexible ways to de-risk, such as collars, variable prepaid forwards, or tax-loss harvesting with long and short positions, he said. If liquidity is the client's primary goal, borrowing against the stock is another solid option.",

    "body": "watch nowVenture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has raised $15 billion to bolster bets across an array of areas including infrastructure, health and what the it calls \"American Dynamism,\" co-founder Ben Horowitz said in a blog post on Friday. The bulk of the capital, $6.75 billion, will go toward a growth fund and two $1.7 billion funds, with one focused on apps and the other on infrastructure. \"At this moment of profound technological opportunity, it is fundamentally important for humanity that America wins,\" Horowitz wrote. \"There is no other country that comes close to giving everyone a chance to grab that opportunity and build. If America fails to win technologically, it will lose economically, militarily, geopolitically, and culturally. And the entire world will lose as well.\"Andreessen Horowitz is dedicating $3 billion to support other venture strategies and about $1.2 billion to fund American interests such as aerospace and defense, the post said. Some $700 million is going toward biotech and health investments. The raise is equal to 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the U.S. last year, Horowitz said. It's more than doubled the amount the firm raised in 2024. Since its founding in 2009, Andreessen Horowitz has risen to become one of the most prominent venture capital firms, known for early investments in Facebook, Coinbase and Airbnb.In recent years, the Silicon Valley-based firm has been betting big on defense tech, with investments in Palmer Luckey's Anduril, Elon Musk's SpaceX and machine parts maker Hadrian.The sector has benefitted from President Donald Trump's ambitious plans to reindustrialize America's military and manufacturing base. This week, the president also called for a $1.5 trillion defense budget next year. Both Horowitz and co-founder Marc Andreessen supported President Trump in the 2024 election, though Horowitz later said he would be donating to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.",

    "body": "Fire and smoke mark where a UPS cargo plane crashed near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Nov. 4, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. Stephen Cohen | Getty ImagesA UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky at around 5:15 p.m. local time Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration said.At least nine people were killed, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said on X Wednesday morning, adding that the death toll could rise. \"Right now these families need prayers, love and support,\" he said. \"Let's wrap our arms around them during this unimaginable time.\"In an earlier press conference Tuesday, he also said 11 people were injured in the incident, some of them significantly. He said at the time that he expected those numbers to rise.UPS said in a statement that there were three crewmembers on the plane. It was unclear if the fatalities were from the plane or on the ground, and Beshear said the status of the crew was unknown. He added that there was an emergency response area set up for families.The reason for the crash was not immediately known. The plane was a MD-11F, a type of freight transport aircraft made by aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas, which merged with Boeing in 1997. The plane had about 38,000 gallons of fuel on board to travel all the way to Honolulu, officials said.The Louisville Metro Police Department said on X that it was implementing a shelter-in-place order near the crash site. Several businesses near the area were affected, officials said.There was no hazardous material on the plane that would create an environmental issue, but the place where it crashed \"could create those types of situations,\" Beshear said. He said a petroleum recycling business and an an auto parts business are in the area and called it an \"all-hands on deck response.\"A plume of smoke wafts over airport property after reports of a plane crash at Louisville International Airport, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Louisville, Ky.Jon Cherry | APA large plume of black smoke was visible near the airport, and footage from local TV showed fire and debris in a large radius around the crash site.The National Transportation Safety Board announced it is sending an investigation team to the incident site Wednesday.The airport was closed Tuesday following the incident, and all departing flights for the evening were canceled. It reopened one runway Wednesday morning, and the airport encouraged travelers to monitor their flight status for delays or cancellations.The airport is home to the UPS Worldport, which the company says is its largest package handling facility in the world.\"We are terribly saddened by the accident tonight in Louisville. Our heartfelt thoughts are with everyone involved. UPS is committed to the safety of our employees, our customers and the communities we serve,\" the company said in a statement. \"This is particularly true in Louisville, home to our airline and thousands of UPSers.\"Hundreds of UPS flights take off daily from Louisville, according to the company. UPS noted late Tuesday that it has halted package sorting operations at the facility.\"This is a UPS town,\" said Louisville city council member Betsy Ruhe.— CNBC's Dennis Green contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a breakfast with Republican Senators at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. November 5, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump conceded that the Democrats' electoral sweep up and down the ballot across the country on Tuesday night spelled bad news for his Republican Party.\"Last night, it was, you know, not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas, but I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" Trump said during a breakfast meeting with GOP senators at the White House on Wednesday morning.\"I'm not sure it was good for anybody,\" Trump said. \"But we had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot, and we're going to talk about that.\"Trump added: \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor.\"\"And they say that I wasn't on the ballot, was the, the biggest factor,\" he said.Trump's reference to the government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, suggests he believes that the stalemate in the Senate is a political liability for the GOP.Recent polls show more Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, which has caused mass furloughs of government workers and led threatened the funding for a slew of federal services.Trump stressed at the breakfast meeting, \"We must get the government back open soon, and really immediately.\"He went on to urge Republicans to terminate the Senate filibuster in order to end the shutdown and force through his policy agenda.The president's remarks came hours after Democratic candidates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill delivered resounding wins in their respective gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, with both projected to notch double-digit margins of victory.The Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, also trounced his main opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who had been endorsed by Trump.Jay Jones, the Democrat running for Virginia attorney general, also defeated his incumbent rival, overcoming a major scandal involving texts he sent in 2022 musing about violence against a Republican political foe.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsTrump's initial reaction to the electoral results, which came as the results were still trickling in Tuesday night, was to claim that his party underperformed because he wasn't on the ballot, and because of the shutdown.\"'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,' according to Pollsters,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. He did not provide a link to those polls.Trump, in follow-up posts, reiterated his recent demand that top Republicans move to eliminate the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, rather than a simple majority.\"REPUBLICANS, TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER! GET BACK TO PASSING LEGISLATION AND VOTER REFORM!\" he wrote.Republican leaders have long opposed taking that step, known as the \"nuclear option,\" for fear that a future Democratic congressional majority would wield that power aggressively.But Trump wants them to nuke the filibuster in order to quickly reopen the government and enact more of his policy agenda, including passing sweeping changes to federal voting laws.He emphasized that view at the breakfast Wednesday morning.\"If you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation,\" he said.After the breakfast meeting, Trump flew to Miami, Florida, where he is scheduled to deliver a speech about the economy. He did not answer reporters' questions about the elections, or the filibuster, as he departed Washington, D.C.This is developing news. Please check back for updates.",

    "body": "Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 4, 2022. Mike Blake | ReutersDigital assets and infrastructure company Ripple said Wednesday it has raised $500 million in funding, lifting its valuation to $40 billion.The fundraise comes after a slew of acquisitions and as the company expands its product base beyond just payments.Crypto and digital asset companies are trying to take advantage of what is seen by the industry as a more favorable environment in the U.S. after the election of President Donald Trump and the passing of a landmark stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act.Ripple, which is closely linked to the XRP cryptocurrency, said the funding round was led by funds managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group, affiliates of Citadel Securities, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace.'Record year of growth'\"The decision to accept $500 million in new common equity reflects the strategic value of deepening relationships with financial partners whose expertise complements Ripple's expanding global suite of products,\" Ripple said, adding that it is continuing its \"record year of growth.\"Monica Long, president of Ripple, told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that the company did not need to raise any money, but had seen demand from institutional investors who wanted to get a share of the company.\"We think it makes good sense to have them as strategic partners, as investors who will have a hand toward building the future\" Long said.Ripple has looked to position itself as a fintech firm bringing crypto and digital assets technology to institutional clients.When Ripple launched in 2012, the company initially focused on using blockchain technology to facilitate cross-border payments. The token XRP was used to move fiat currencies quickly.Since then, Ripple has bolstered its payments business and expanded into new areas through aggressive acquisitions. In just over two years, Ripple said it has completed six acquisitions.Last year, the company launched its own stablecoin, a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by real-world assets. Stablecoins are seen as a key way to move money quickly around the world as they can operate 24 hours a day. This year, Ripple acquired an enterprise-focused stablecoin platform called Rail.Beyond payments, Ripple has pushed into other lines of business, including custody of crypto assets, prime brokerage and corporate treasury management.Long said the company's acquisition strategy was focused on companies that will complement Ripple's core payments business, or allow it to push into new areas.\"We will continue to look at where new opportunities arise in those two things,\" Long said.While other crypto-focused companies such as Circle have gone public, Long said this is not on the radar for Ripple right now.\"We are really pleased to see crypto companies going public, that is great for our overall industry continuing to mature,\" Long said.\"We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships. We will continue to remain private.\"Ripple's funding comes as cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. This week, bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June, with billions of dollars being wiped off the overall market.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he arrives at Palm Beach International Airport on Oct. 31, 2025 in West Palm Beach, Florida.Samuel Corum | Getty ImagesSupreme Court justices on Wednesday morning expressed skepticism about the legality of aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump against most of the world's nations.Conservative and liberal justices sharply questioned Solicitor General D. John Sauer on the Trump administration's legal justification of the tariffs, which critics say infringes on the power of Congress to tax. Lower federal courts have ruled that Trump lacked the legal authority he cited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many U.S. trading partners, and fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China and Mexico.Sauer, who is defending the tariff policy as grounded in the power to regulate foreign commerce, said \"these are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue-raising tariffs.\"\"The fact that they raise revenue was only incidental,\" Sauer argued.Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court's three liberal members, told Sauer, \"You say tariffs are not taxes, but that's exactly what they are.\"\"They're generating money from American citizens, revenue,\" Sotomayor said.She later noted that no president other than Trump has every used the IEEPA to impose tariffs.Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of six conservatives on the court, pressed Sauer on the fact that Trump had unilaterally imposed the tariffs, citing an international emergency, without Congress authorizing them.\"What happens when the president simply vetoes legislation to take these powers back?\" Gorsuch asked.\"So Congress as a practical matter can't get this power back?\"Sauer has been questioned by the justices for more than one hour, without a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case making his argument.The tariffs start at a baseline of 10% on many nations, and spike to as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil.The tariffs, if allowed to stand, would result in $3 trillion in extra revenue for the United States by 2035, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That group last week said the federal government collected $151 billion from customs duties in the second half of fiscal year 2025, \"a nearly 300% increase over the same period in\" fiscal year 2024.Rick Woldenberg, CEO of educational toy company Learning Resources, which is involved in a case against U.S. President Donald Trump, stands outside the U.S. Supreme Court, as its justices are set to hear oral arguments on Trump's bid to preserve sweeping tariffs after lower courts ruled that he overstepped his authority, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 5, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who planned to attend Wednesday's oral arguments, said in a court filing in September that the U.S. might have to refund $750 billion or more if the Supreme Court ruled the tariffs are illegal and waited until next summer to issue that ruling.The Supreme Court will not issue a decision in the case on Wednesday. It is not clear when the court will release its ruling.The case is seen as a key legal test for Trump, who has won some favorable rulings from the Supreme Court for other policies during his second term in the White House.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsTrump insists the tariffs are crucial to protecting the American economy and citizens, and serve as a sharp prod to companies to make their products in the United States.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, \"Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country.\"\"With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security,\" Trump wrote in the Truth Social post.\"Without it, we are virtually defenseless against other Countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us. Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,\" he said. \"A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.\"Critics of tariffs say the financial hit is borne not by foreign manufacturers but by U.S. importers who pay them, and then largely pass on the added costs to American consumers.Trump previously said he was considering attending the oral arguments, which would have been an apparent first for a sitting president.On Sunday, he said on Truth SociaI, \"I will not be going to the Court on Wednesday in that I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.\"It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential Decisions ever made by the United States Supreme Court,\" he wrote.This is developing news.

    "body": "A jobseeker speaks with a recruiter during a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPayroll growth at private companies turned slightly stronger than expected in October, providing some hope that the labor market isn't in danger of sinking, ADP reported Wednesday.Companies added 42,000 jobs for the month, following a decline of 29,000 in September and topping the Dow Jones consensus estimate for a gain of 22,000. A revision for September showed 3,000 fewer jobs lost, the payrolls processing firm said.A gain of 47,000 in the trade, transportation and utilities grouping helped offset losses in multiple other categories. Education and health services also showed growth of 26,000, while financial activities added 11,000.Despite the artificial intelligence-fueled tech boom, information services saw a decline of 17,000 positions. Other sectors posting losses included professional and business services (-15,000), other services (-13,000), and manufacturing (-3,000), a sector that continues to struggle despite President Donald Trump's tariffs aimed at bringing factory jobs back to the U.S.All of the job creation came from companies employing at least 250 workers. That category added 76,000 jobs, while smaller businesses lost 34,000. The trend away from job growth at small businesses is significant, considering they are responsible for three of every four jobs, ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said.\"While big companies make headlines, small companies drive hiring,\" Richardson said on CNBC. \"So to see that weakness at the small company level is still a concern, and I think that's one of the reasons why the recovery has been so tepid.\"Despite the meager job growth, salaries continued to rise. Year-over-year pay for those staying in their jobs rose 4.5%, the same as in September, while job switchers saw a 6.7% increase, up slightly from a month ago.\"Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July, but hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year,\" Richardson said. \"Meanwhile, pay growth has been largely flat for more than a year, indicating that shifts in supply and demand are balanced.\"By ADP's count, job growth has averaged about 60,000 a month. However, that has tailed off significantly in the second half of the year.The ADP count comes out the first Wednesday of the month and usually takes a back seat to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official nonfarm payrolls report released two days later. However, because of the history-making government shutdown, the BLS, like all other government agencies, has suspended data collection and releases.Had the BLS report been released, Wall Street was looking for it to show a drop of 60,000 jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5%.Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern over the state of the labor market, saying it has overtaken for now the central bank's attention toward inflation running above the 2% target. The Fed at its meeting last week approved a quarter percentage point reduction in its key interest rate, which now is targeted between 3.75%-4%.Though the BLS has gone dark, officials will get a look at other data this week.Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday releases its monthly look at announced layoffs, while economists will watch state-level jobless claims for a look at whether companies are shrinking payrolls. The University of Michigan on Friday also will release its monthly sentiment index which provides snapshots of how consumers feel about broader economic conditions. Recent data from jobs site indeed show employment postings at their lowest since February 2021.",

    "body": "watch nowMcDonald's on Wednesday fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations, but the company's U.S. restaurants reported better-than-expected same-store sales growth.CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement that the third-quarter results are \"a testament to our ability to deliver sustainable growth even in a challenging environment.\"For more than a year, McDonald's, long considered a bellwether for the financial health of consumers, has been sounding the alarm about a pullback in restaurant spending, particularly from low-income diners. That downturn continued during the third quarter.\"We continue to see a bifurcated consumer base with [quick-service restaurant] traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years,\" Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. \"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double digits in the quarter.\"He added that McDonald's is projecting that the pressure on consumers' financial health will continue well into 2026.Shares of the company rose more than 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.22 adjusted vs. $3.33 expectedRevenue: $7.08 billion vs. $7.1 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported third-quarter net income of $2.28 billion, or $3.18 per share, up from $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, a year earlier. McDonald's saw a higher effective tax rate during the quarter, which weighed on its earnings.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, the burger chain earned $3.22 per share.Revenue rose 3% to $7.08 billion.A McDonald's restaurant is viewed on July 22, 2024 in Burbank, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe company's same-store sales increased 3.6%, a reversal from the year-ago period's decline of 1.5% and roughly in line with Wall Street's expectations, according to StreetAccount.In the United States, McDonald's same-store sales rose 2.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 1.9%. The company credited growth in average check, suggesting that diners are paying more for their meals despite the ongoing \"value wars\" between fast-food chains.In an appeal to budget-conscious consumers, McDonald's brought back its Snack Wraps for the first time in nine years and priced them at $2.99. CFO Ian Borden said it was one of the most popular chicken launches in recent history in the U.S., with nearly 1 in 5 customers purchasing a Snack Wrap in the first four weeks.And in September, the chain reintroduced Extra Value Meals, which it last promoted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Executives said that McDonald's value offerings have helped the chain gain market share with high-income diners.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" Kempczinski said. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Outside of the U.S., McDonald's saw even stronger same-store sales growth. Its international operated markets division, which includes Australia and Canada, reported a 4.3% increase in same-store sales.\"The value platforms we've had in place for several quarters in our IOM markets are resonating with our customers and continuing to improve value and affordability scores,\" Kempczinski said.And McDonald's international developmental licensed markets segment saw its same-store sales grow 4.7%, lifted by demand in Japan.Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company is projecting stronger U.S. same-store sales growth, fueled by the return of McDonald's Monopoly and the Extra Value Meals. The chain is also facing easy comparisons to last year's fourth quarter, when an E. coli outbreak weighed on its domestic sales.However, the company's international divisions may see same-store sales growth slow next quarter as the two segments face tougher comparisons, Borden said.Correction: McDonald's priced its new Snack Wraps at $2.99. A previous version of this story misstated the price.",

Extra Comfort, Lyft Black, Black SUV and regular airport rides will earn three miles per dollar. Pre-scheduled rides to and from the airport will rake in four miles per dollar.The company said rewards do not stack. Riders get the highest value multiplier on a booking.Lyft marketing chief Brian Irving told CNBC that the partnership builds on both Lyft and United's commitment to building better customer experiences.\"We have this simple, yet really customer-obsessed way of approaching things,\" he said.Earlier this year, Delta dissolved its eight-year partnership with Lyft and brought its loyalty program to ride-hailing competitor Uber.Read more CNBC tech newsMicrosoft plans to hire more but with 'a lot more leverage' thanks to AI, CEO Satya Nadella saysWhile AI spending is top of mind, online ads are driving a lot of Big Tech's growthMicrosoft AI chief says only biological beings can be consciousMusk teases Tesla Roadster demo by year-end.

The company also earns revenues through reward and co-branded credit cards.United said the agreement builds on its commitment to broadening its partnership ecosystem for customers. Other United partners include Ticketmaster and Avis, and the airline brought music streamer Spotify to seatback screens this summer.Both companies hope to expand the partnership through more tech innovation and data integration, said Richard Nunn, CEO of United's MileagePlus program.\"This is very much the start of a very deep and meaningful technology integration,\" he said.Riders will be able to redeem miles for rides directly through the Lyft app and get alerts and reminders for United flights. The capability should be available starting early next year.United is also offering 1,000 bonus miles to new Lyft riders who link their loyalty accounts and complete two rides in 30 days.",

The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.Orsted flagged third-quarter impairment costs of nearly 1.8 billion Danish kroner.The company, however, reiterated its full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) guidance of 24-27 billion Danish kroner, excluding earnings from new partnerships and cancellation fees.It comes shortly after the company announced it had reached a deal to sell a 50% stake in its Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm in the U.K. to Apollo Global Management in a deal worth $6 billion.\"I'm satisfied with the good progress across our entire construction portfolio and our solid operational performance,\" Orsted CEO Rasmus Errboe said in a statement.\"Our key focus is to continue delivering on our business plan, which will enable Ørsted to remain a global leader of offshore wind with a strong foothold in Europe,\" he added.Shares of Orsted were 1.2% higher on Wednesday morning. The stock price has fallen sharply this year amid concerted efforts from the White House to halt several ongoing developments and suspend new licensing.Vestas shares popDanish wind turbine firm Vestas, meanwhile, reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.The firm on Wednesday said that operating profit came in at 416 million euros ($477.8 million) for the July-September period, above expectations of 305 million euros estimated by analysts in a company-compiled consensus.Shares of Vestas jumped more than 14% on the news, soaring to the top of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index, as investors welcomed signs of a successful turnaround following years of losses.Asked about some of the headwinds facing the wind industry, notably from the Trump administration, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a \"well-established\" supply chain in the U.S.\"For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with,\" Andersen told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday.\"Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making,\" he added.",

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Tuesday, March 25, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLast week saw a big swing in mortgage interest rates, and that took a toll on demand. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.9% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.For the week, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.31% from 6.30% for loans with a 20% down payment. That was the weekly average, but rates actually fell to the lowest level in over a year last Tuesday and then shot up sharply Wednesday afternoon, following the announcement on interest rates from the Federal Reserve and comments from Chair Jerome Powell. Rates continued to rise Thursday, according to a separate report from Mortgage News Daily, and then came back very slightly Friday.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to daily moves in interest rates, fell 3% for the week, although they were still 151% higher than the same week one year ago. Refinancing had been on a run in the weeks before because interest rates last year at this time were higher.\"The average loan size for refinance applications was at its highest level in six weeks, as borrowers with larger loans continued to seek ways to lower their monthly payments,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 1% for the week and were 26% higher than the same week one year ago.\"Purchase applications declined slightly from a week ago, however, there was slight increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective homebuyers continue to seek loan options to help manage challenging affordability conditions,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates moved slightly higher to start this week and could go more decidedly in either direction after economic data on employment is released Wednesday.",

The report comes about two weeks after Super Micro issued preliminary earnings and said it expected revenue of $5 billion for the quarter, down from prior guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion.Net income fell by more than half to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.In its partial report last month, Super Micro said \"design win upgrades\" pushed some expected first-quarter revenue to the second quarter. The company said it now expects sales of $10 billion to $11 billion in the current quarter, above the $7.83 billion average estimate, according to LSEG.Super Micro has been a big beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, as its servers come packed with graphics processing units from Nvidia. But after growth soared from late 2023 through last year, the business has flatlined, with some analysts saying that Dell has taken market share.Prior to Tuesday's report, the stock was up 55% for the year.WATCH: Going short on AI is a bad ideawatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe head of the air traffic controllers' union said Wednesday that it could take the industry \"weeks to recover\" from the impacts of the government shutdown.Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that the holiday season will be especially affected by the shortage of air traffic controllers, who missed their first full paycheck last week. The Department of Transportation has reported increased delays and ground stops as a result of the shutdown, now in its fifth consecutive week.\"To somehow fathom we could go into the holiday season still in a government shutdown, I can't even begin to predict what the impacts will be across this country,\" Daniels said. \"Three-hour TSA wait lines will be the least of our worries.\"The FAA Air Traffic Control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in Newark, New Jersey, US, on Monday, Nov. 3, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAir traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the employees required to work during the shutdown as essential employees, even though they're not receiving regular paychecks. The shutdown, which entered its 36th full day on Wednesday, is now the longest in history.Even if the shutdown ended today, Daniels added, the impacts could take much longer to be seen among air traffic controllers and could pose challenges for the industry at large.\"We've been in this shutdown for so long at this point, I don't think we'll actually see the damage until well after the shutdown ends, seeing air traffic controllers resign from this career and profession,\" he said. \"Even if they open the government today, we won't see the pay that we deserve, that we've rightfully earned for over two to two and a half months.\"Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom.

That shutdown ended after air traffic controller shortages led to severe disruptions at U.S. airports.\"We'll do everything we can and be the professionals that show up and try to move the aircraft across the airspace — at the same time, we can't make the impossible possible if it's just going to be putting us in an impossible situation,\" Daniels said.Earlier this week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Squawk Box\" that he may \"shut the whole airspace down\" if the shutdown continues to stretch on. The industry is currently 2,000 to 3,000 controllers short of its ideal staffing goal, he added.\"We won't let people travel, [but] we're not there at this point. It's just significant delays,\" Duffy said.",

Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has renominated Jared Isaacman to run NASA after pulling his prior nomination months ago due to what the president called a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday. Isaacman, who is friends with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, was originally picked to lead NASA in December, before Trump had even taken office. Isaacman is a billionaire who founded payments company Shift4 and has led two private spaceflights.But Trump pulled the nomination in late May after a spat between the president and Musk, who had been leading a White House effort to slash the size of the federal government. Trump said at the time that he was withdrawing the pick because of Isaacman's past associations, though he didn't specify what those were. Some reports have suggested that it was a reference to Isaacman's prior donations to Democrats.Days after the withdrawal, Isaacman told Shift4 investors in a letter that his \"brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience.\" He also said that he was resigning as CEO of Shift4, which he founded in 1999 at age 16, and would assume the role of executive chairman. He had been planning to leave the company if his nomination was confirmed by the Senate. But it never got that far.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been running NASA as interim head since July. Isaacman still must go through the Senate confirmation process. The federal government has been shut down since the beginning of October, but the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. WATCH: Trump renominates Jared Isaacman to run NASAwatch now",

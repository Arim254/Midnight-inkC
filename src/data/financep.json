    "body": "Changpeng Zhao, former chief executive officer of Binance, arrives at federal court in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump has pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering while heading the cryptocurrency exchange, the White House said Thursday.The pardon came two months after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump family's own crypto venture, which has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election, has been helped by \"a partnership with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.\"\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden Administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims,\" Leavitt said.Trump's pardon of Zhao came nearly a week after he commuted the 87-month prison sentence of former New York Rep. George Santos, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.Zhao, in November 2023, pleaded guilty in Seattle federal court and agreed to step down as Binance CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement by the company with the Department of Justice.Zhao had been charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to \"implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and for willfully  violating U.S. economic sanctions \"in a deliberate and calculated effort to profit from the U.S. market without implementing controls required by U.S. law,\" the DOJ said.Binance had been charged with conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Powers Act and conspiracy.He was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail.Federal prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence Zhao to three years in prison.Leavitt noted that request in her statement on Thursday about Zhao's pardon.\"The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career,\" Leavitt said.\"These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation,\" she said. \"The Biden Administration's war on crypto is over.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "An 'Open House' sign is posted near a single family home for sale on Aug. 22, 2025 in Pasadena, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes rose 1.5% in September from August to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 4.06 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is slightly less than the analysts were forecasting, but the highest pace in seven months.Sales were 4.1% higher compared with September of last year.Regionally, on an annual basis, sales were strongest in the South and Northeast. From August, sales were strongest in the West and actually fell slightly in the Midwest, the only region to see a monthly decline.This count is based on closings, so people signing contracts likely in July and August, when mortgage rates were coming down but were not as low as they are now. The average rate on the 30-year fixed started July at 6.67% and is now at 6.17%, according to Mortgage News Daily. \"As anticipated, falling mortgage rates are lifting home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"Improving housing affordability is also contributing to the increase in sales.\"Inventory continued to make gains, up 14% from a year ago to 1.55 million units for sale at the end of September. That is still lean historically. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.6-month supply of homes for sale. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Inventory is matching a five-year high, though it remains below pre-Covid levels,\" Yun added. \"Many homeowners are financially comfortable, resulting in very few distressed properties and forced sales. Home prices continue to rise in most parts of the country, further contributing to overall household wealth.\" Still tight supply continues to pressure prices. The median price of a home sold in September was $415,200, up 2.1% year over year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. Prices are 53% higher than pre-Covid levels.Sales continue to see the biggest gains on the high end of the market, likely because of more supply in those tiers. Sales of home priced above $1 million rose 20% from the year before, while sales of homes priced below $100,000 were up just under 3%.First-time homebuyers are making some gains, likely due to falling mortgage rates. They made up 30% of September sales, up from 26% the year before.About 30% of sales were made all in cash. Homes are sitting on the market longer, an average 33 days, up from 28 a year ago.",

    "body": "Parts of the IBM Quantum System Two are displayed at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York on June 6, 2025.Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration is in talks with several quantum-computing firms about giving the Commerce Department equity stakes in exchange for federal funding, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The Journal, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, said the companies include IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum. Other firms, such as Quantum Computing Inc. and Atom Computing, are considering similar arrangements, it added. IonQ shares jumped 11% Thursday. D-Wave climbed 20%. Rigetti added 13%. Quantum Computing was up 10%. Arqit Quantum added 11%.The news aligns with recent efforts by Washington to take stakes in major companies within industries seen as vital to U.S. national security, especially those receiving public funds. One of the earliest examples under U.S. President Donald Trump's second term came when the Defense Department invested $400 million in American rare earths company MP Materials for about a 15% stake in the company. A month later, the government took a roughly 10% stake in semiconductor firm Intel — the only American company capable of making advanced AI processors on U.S. soil.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIonQ, D-Wave, Rigetti Computing, Quantum Computing, Arqit Quantum,1 day stock chart.The stakes in quantum computing companies would come with minimum funding awards of $10 million each, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. Other technology companies are also expected to compete for the grants.An interventionist shift in WashingtonThe U.S. government's growing interest in taking stakes in private companies is quite unprecedented in recent decades, especially outside of a financial crisis, signaling an ideological shift toward greater intervention in certain industries. However, the Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Oct. 15. \"We do have to be very careful not to overreach,\" he said.Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have argued that the government should benefit from a company's success in cases where federal funds have played a role in its growth.The targeted industries also appear to reflect Washington's focus on technological and economic competition with China. The U.S. stake in MP Materials, for example, came after China restricted exports of rare earth elements —essential components in high-tech products — prompting Washington to boost efforts to build its domestic supply chain. Intel's funding also aligns with U.S. efforts to strengthen its domestic semiconductor industry to support its broader race for dominance in artificial intelligence.Quantum computing, which utilizes quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the capabilities of today's most supercomputers, is likely viewed as one of the next strategically critical technologies for Washington to focus on, due to its massive economic and security implications. Experts believe that the advanced tech could revolutionize fields including medicine, finance, and materials science by solving complex problems currently impossible for traditional computers, and pose major cybersecurity threats if it falls into the hands of adversaries.",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit (FAIR) and other product-related positions will be impacted.However, the cuts did not impact employees within TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into the social media company this summer, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Those employees, overseen by Wang, were spared by the layoffs, underscoring Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on his expensive hires versus the legacy employees, the people said.Within Meta, the AI unit was considered to be bloated, with teams like FAIR and more product-oriented groups often vying for computing resources, the people said. When the company's new hires joined the company to create Superintelligence Labs, it inherited the oversized Meta AI unit, they said. The layoffs are an attempt by Meta to continue trim the department and further cement Wang's role in steering the company's AI strategy.Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.Following the cuts, Meta's Superintelligence Labs' workforce now sits at just under 3,000, the people said.Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a \"non-working notice period.\"\"During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,\" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. \"You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.\"The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, \"minus your notice period.\"CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.Axios was first to report the layoffs.— CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

    "body": "Jasondoiy | E+ | Getty ImagesAmid recession fears, a government shutdown and tariff uncertainty, consumers are increasingly diverging in their spending.Wealthier Americans are engaging their purchasing power, while lower-income Americans are starting to pull back — commonly described as a \"K-shaped\" economy. Friday's consumer price index report could shed more light on the pressures facing large swaths of the country.The CPI report, which measures price changes across a range of goods and services, was delayed due to the government shutdown, originally scheduled to be released nine days prior. Though the report will not include any data related to the shutdown, it will offer a read on the state of inflation ahead of a Nov. 1 deadline for the Social Security Administration to calculate annual cost-of-living adjustments.Lower- and middle-income consumers have been hit hardest by rising costs on daily essentials like groceries and gas. Meanwhile, wealthier investors have benefited from stock market rallies and rising home values. Recent data from JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey found that income bracket was a large factor in Americans' varying views of the current state of the economy.Here's where bifurcation is beginning to take hold:Food and beverageCoca-Cola, often viewed as a bellwether for the financial health of consumer, has been seeing the divergence across its business.Pricier products that are more exposed to high-income consumers, like Topo Chico sparkling water and Fairlife protein shakes, are fueling the company's sales growth, CEO James Quincey told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday. At the same time, Coke is seeing higher demand at both dollar stores that cater to low-income consumers looking for deals and higher-end outlets that skew toward wealthier consumers, like fast-casual restaurants and amusement parks.McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in early September that the burger chain's expansion of its value menu was in response to a divided consumer landscape, or what he called a \"two-tier economy.\"While Kempczinski said the company is seeing upper-income consumers performing well, its lower- and middle-income diners are \"a different story.\"\"Traffic for lower-income consumers is down double digits, and it's because people are either choosing to skip a meal... or they're choosing to just eat at home,\" he said last month.A similar dynamic is playing out at Chipotle, according to Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer.\"There are certain cohorts of the consumer, definitely on the lower-income side, that are feeling pressure right now. That's something that we'll have to take into consideration when looking at price going forward,\" Rymer told Reuters in July.Autos and airfareLast month, the average price for a new vehicle surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever, according to Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book.The record pricing comes as auto loan defaults and repossessions are on the rise, particularly for those with FICO scores below 620.\"Today's auto market is being driven by wealthier households who have access to capital, good loan rates and are propping up the higher end of the market,\" said Cox Automotive executive analyst Erin Keating in a statement last week.And though airlines have been piloting premium offerings for years, the higher-cost tickets have gained momentum in recent months.Delta Air Lines said earlier this month that revenue from its premium offerings is expected to surpass the coach cabin next year, with CEO Ed Bastian saying he's not seeing any signs of slowdown in the roomier, more expensive seats.HospitalityStill, though there are signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy, some argue it's not here to stay.Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta told CNBC last month that he's seeing a bifurcation, but he doesn't expect that pattern to last much longer, partly because he sees inflation and interest rates decreasing.\"My own belief is that as we look into the fourth quarter and particularly into next year, we're going to see a very big shift in those dynamics, meaning, I don't think you're going to continue to have this bifurcation,\" Nassetta said. \"That's not to say I think the high end is going to get worse or bad, I just think the middle and the low end is going to move up.\"On Wednesday, the hotel chain reported a drop in revenue for affordable brands like Hampton by Hilton and Homewood Suites by Hilton.Meanwhile, Nassetta told investors on an earnings call that revenue from luxury offerings performed exceedingly well and remains a focus for Hilton moving forward.— CNBC's Amelia Lucas, Michael Wayland, Alex Harring, Luke Fountain and Leslie Josephs contributed to this report.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Rivian Automotive reportedly plans to lay off more than 600 people as the all-electric vehicle maker faces growing market challenges.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the plans, said the layoffs will affect roughly 4% of the company's workers. Rivian had just under 15,000 employees at the end of last year.A source familiar with the plans confirmed the layoffs to CNBC and said additional details are set to be shared with employees Thursday.Rivian and other EV manufacturers are increasingly facing a more challenging market than they did in recent years amid changing regulations under the Trump administration, including the elimination of a $7,500 federal incentive for purchasing an EV.Aside from regulatory issues, Rivian also faces slower-than-expected EV demand and a lack of new products until next year amid needs for cash and earnings losses. The company lost $1.1 billion during the second quarter.Rivian's vehicle sales increased 32% to 13,201 units year over year during the third quarter as buyers hurried to purchase an EV before the federal incentives expired at the end of September, but the company's 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed from as many as 46,000 units to between 41,500 to 43,500 vehicles.In August, Rivian also flagged a bigger adjusted core loss this year, expecting it to between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast.Shares of Rivian were level during trading Thursday morning. The stock is off roughly 3% this year.",

    "body": "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen speaks, while sat with U.S. President Donald Trump, after the announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and EU, in Turnberry, Scotland, Britain, July 27, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersRelations between the U.S. and European Union have been thorny this year with differences over how to support Ukraine, trade tensions and tariffs, dominating a tense period of diplomacy between the power blocs.But, in a somewhat ironic twist of the ongoing Ukraine war, a shared sense of frustration and suspicion of Russia's refusal to come to the negotiating table has brought the U.S. and EU closer together.A united front was seen this week, with Washington and Brussels announcing complimentary packages of sanctions targeting Russia's oil and gas industry.The U.S.and EU are on the same page when it comes to pressuring Russia to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, Andrew Puzder, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, told CNBC Thursday.\"President Trump has been adamant that he wants to see this war end ... But when you see the negotiations aren't going the way you want them to go, you need to ramp up the pressure,\" Puzder told CNBC's Silvia Amaro in Brussels.He noted that the U.S. and EU's almost simultaneous sanctions packages are \"an indication that we need to step it up. We're willing to step it up, and hopefully Vladimir Putin will get the message and understand that the war needs to come to an end. He doesn't seem to have gotten that message yet, but hopefully this will bring it home,\" he said.U.S.-EU relations had generally improved in recent months in a number of geopolitical and economic areas, Puzder said, noting, \"we may not always agree but I think their motives are always good and I think they just look at things a little differently than we do,\" he said.watch nowOn Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury announced new sanctions on Russia's largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, while the EU on Thursday adopted its 19th package of measures against Moscow, banning Russian liquefied natural gas imports and targeting its finance industry and military industrial complex.Washington's latest actions were cheered by Ukraine and the EU following concerns last week that U.S. President Donald Trump could side with Russia when it came to a resolution to the war, after he appeared to parrot the Kremlin's position that Ukraine should cede occupied territory to Russia as part of a peace deal.Trump appeared to reverse that stance on Wednesday, however, when he said he had found that talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere,\" and that he'd decided to cancel a summit with Putin that was meant to take place in Hungary in the next few weeks.Needless to say, the sanctions, Trump's criticism of Putin and the cancelation of in-person talks, elicited a stony silence from Moscow on Thursday.Puzder said that during his time in the ambassadorial post, he had noticed the EU and U.S. become more aligned on a number of other matters, including China and on immigration.\"I think on those issues we're moving closer together and I think the trade agreement was huge for both [sides],\" he said, praising European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for negotiating a deal that he said \"was better than any other country [Trump's] negotiated with.\"Bad startU.S.-EU relations took a dive when Trump returned to office at the start of the year with the U.S. leader taking immediate aim at the bloc, accusing it of unfair trade practices on the grounds that it has run a persistent trade surplus when it comes to the exchange of goods.In January, Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos that, \"from the standpoint of America, the EU treats us very, very unfairly, very badly.\"watch nowHe has repeated that position and perspective at various times this year and while the EU has denied the accusations, U.S.-EU trade data does shows it has enjoyed a trade surplus (at least when it comes to goods) with the U.S. for years.European Council figures for 2024, for example, show total trade between the EU and U.S. amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.97 trillion) but while the EU ran a trade surplus in goods, it recorded a deficit in services with the U.S. When both goods and services were taken into account, the bloc had a surplus of around 50 billion euros last year.That data informed Trump's decision to impose, initially, a 30% tariff on EU goods imports entering the States, much to the bloc's dismay. He then lowered the tariff to 15% as part of the framework of a trade agreement reached in July, which was higher than the 10% levy the EU was hoping for.Read moreThe EU also agreed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest an additional $600 billion worth of investments into the U.S.Ambassador Puzder said trade relations were going to improve as the trade deal was put into practice.\"As we turn that framework into a finalized agreement, I think it'll be to great benefit of both countries and continue this great transatlantic relationship that we have had for 250 years.\"",

    "body": "A woman wearing a Gucci belt and bag is seen during Paris Fashion Week in September 2018Christian Vierig | Getty ImagesShares of Gucci owner Kering closed up 8.7% on Thursday, hitting a 1-year high after the company's sales decline narrowed and quarterly earnings beat estimates.The French luxury giant – whose brands include Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga – reported sales of 3.42 billion euros ($3.97 billion) for the third quarter, a 5% decline on a comparable basis from the same period a year earlier. It marked an improvement from the second quarter, when comparable sales fell 15% year-on-year.Sales at Gucci, the firm's biggest brand, fell 14% year-on-year on a comparable basis to 1.34 billion euros, with improvements at some of its smaller houses cushioning the blow for Kering.The company noted that the decline at Gucci still represented sharp sequential improvement from the previous quarter, when the brand's sales plunged 25%. Group sales had been expected to hit 3.31 billion euros in the quarter, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet, with Gucci sales — which typically make up close to half of Kering's total revenues — forecast to come in at 1.32 billion euros.watch nowKering noted in its presentation on the third-quarter performance that currency fluctuations remained \"a significant headwind,\" with the sales decline including a negative currency effect of 5%.Kering remains committed to turning the company's performance around, CEO Luca de Meo said in a statement alongside the results. He added that the luxury giant's \"third-quarter performance, while representing a clear sequential improvement, remains far below that of the market.\"\"This reinforces my determination to work on all dimensions of the business to return our Houses and the Group to the prominence they deserve. We are working relentlessly on our turnaround, as shown by our recent decisions.\"Business turnaroundEarlier this week, Kering announced it had agreed to sell its beauty unit to L'Oreal for $4.7 billion as De Meo seeks to slash the firm's debts and focus its efforts on its core fashion businesses.On Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank upgraded its price target for Kering by 3.4% to 300 euros. Shares were last trading at around 340.45 euros.\"Importantly the better sales performance was across all major brands and with gross margin and opex guidance being held there is a good drop through to EBIT forecasts,\" Deutsche's Adam Cochrane said in a note.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKering share price\"Looking at Gucci specifically the improvement was supported by leather goods where the handbag ranges were refreshed over the course of the last 18 months which should see support from carryover lines to the Demna inspired RTW launch in 1H 26.\"Analysts at UBS, meanwhile, said Kering's report confirmed \"the overall improving sector context but also the initial success of the actions taken by the management to turn the business around.\"\"Net net, given that the equity story is centered around Gucci turnaround, bears may argue that Gucci in fact has improved at the same pace as other brands, thus suggesting limited evidence of its momentum outpacing the group,\" they added.Shares of Kering have surged around 33% so far this year, amid a boom in the luxury sector. However, stagnating sales, price rises, and renewed trade tensions have fueled questions about the outlook for high-end goods.Last week, European luxury stocks, including Kering, rallied following a surprise return to growth from LVMH. The French conglomerate is seen as a bellwether for the wider luxury sector.Kering has faced its own unique challenges, including weakening demand for its key brands and leadership changes. Investors were spooked by the company's second-quarter earnings, which revealed a 25% plunge in Gucci sales.",

    "body": "Steve Wozniak, co-founder of the technology company Apple.Thomas Banneyer | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesA group of prominent figures, including artificial intelligence and technology experts, has called for an end to efforts to create 'superintelligence' — a form of AI that would surpass humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. Over 850 people, including tech leaders like Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, signed a statement published Wednesday calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. The list of signatories was notably topped by prominent AI pioneers, including the computer scientists Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, who are widely considered \"godfathers\" of modern AI. Leading AI researchers like UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell also signed on. Superintelligence has become a buzzword in the AI world, as companies from Elon Musk's xAI to Sam Altman's OpenAI compete to release more advanced large language models. Meta notably has gone so far as to name its LLM division the 'Meta Superintelligence Labs.' But signatories of the recent statement warn that the prospect of superintelligence has \"raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"It called for a ban on developing superintelligence until there is strong public support for the technology and a scientific consensus that it can be built and controlled safely.In addition to AI and tech figures, the names behind the statement came from a broad coalition ranging from academics, media personalities, religious leaders and a bipartisan group of former U.S. politicians and officials. Those retired officials included former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.Meanwhile, Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck — influential media allies to U.S. President Donald Trump — were also prominently featured on the list.Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon speaks during the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025 at Conrad Washington on April 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesOther high-profile signatories included the British royal family members Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as well as former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. As of Wednesday, the list was still growing.AI doomers versus AI boomersThere has been a growing divide in the tech space between those who see AI as a powerful force for good, warranting unfettered development, and those who believe it's dangerous and in need of more regulation. However, as noted by the 'Statement on Superintelligence' signatory website, even the leaders of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, such as Musk and Altman, have, in the past, warned about the dangers of superintelligence. Before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Altman wrote in a 2015 blog post that \"development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.\"watch nowMeanwhile, Elon Musk said on a podcast earlier this year that there was \"only a 20% chance of annihilation\" when discussing the risks of advanced AI surpassing human intelligence. The 'Statement on Superintelligence' cited a recent survey from the Future of Life Institute showing that only 5% of U.S. adults support \"the status quo of fast, unregulated\" superintelligence development. The survey of 2,000 American adults also found that a majority believe \"superhuman AI\" shouldn't be created until proven safe or controllable and want robust regulation on advanced AI. In a statement provided on the site, computer scientist Bengio said AI systems could surpass most individuals in most cognitive tasks within a few years. He added that while such advances could help solve global challenges, they also carry significant risks.\"To safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design AI systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,\" he said. \"We also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future.\"",

MetOp-SG is a family of meteorological satellites placed in sun-synchronous polar orbit which will make it possible to refine short-term forecasts. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images)Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesAirbus, Leonardo and Thales announced Thursday that they will combine their satellite and space activities to form a \"leading European player in space,\" as the region looks for a homegrown rival to Elon Musk's Starlink.The companies — each a heavyweight in the aerospace and defense sector in their own right — said the joint venture would develop and build, \"a comprehensive portfolio of complementary technologies and end-to-end solutions, from space infrastructure to services.\" The development of space launchers will be excluded from the new company's operations.The combined entity is expected to generate mid-triple-digit million euros in annual synergies on operating income within five years of closing, and it's set to employ 25,000 people across Europe.European defense stocks jumped on Thursday, with the regional Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index adding 0.9%. Leonardo shares were last seen trading 1.8% higher, while Thales gained 0.6% and Airbus was up by 0.2%.Airbus will be the majority owner of the new joint venture with a 35% stake, and will contribute its Space Systems and Space Digital businesses from its defense and space division. Leonardo and Thales will each hold a 32.5% stake in the new company.Leonardo's contribution will be its entire Space division, including its shares in Rome-based spaceflight services firm Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space, an existing joint venture with Thales. Thales will also add its stake in Thales Alenia Space to the new company, as well as its Thales SESO operation. The firms said the new space entity would be \"a unified, integrated and resilient European space player, with the critical mass to compete globally and grow on the export markets.\"\"This new company also intends to serve as the trusted partner for developing and implementing national sovereign space programs,\" they added.Touting the joint venture as \"a pivotal milestone for Europe's space industry,\" the chief executies of the firms said in a joint statement that it would help \"build a stronger and more competitive European presence in an increasingly dynamic global space market.\" They stressed that the move would allow Europe to retain control over its domestic space operations, as regional governments look to pour cash into their aerospace and defense capabilities. Starlink rivalEurope has been looking for an alternative to Starlink, the satellite broadband service owned by Musk's space exploration firm SpaceX that currently dominates the sector and has a vast presence across Europe.Starlink has played a critical role in Ukraine's war effort since Russia's full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, but issues have reportedly arisen in the past with communication blackouts. Earlier this year, it was rumored that Eutelsat — the French firm that merged with Britain's OneWeb in 2023 — was in the running to replace Starlink in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has backed the concept of a European satellite champion, arguing in a speech over the summer that \"space has in some way become a gauge of international power.\" Meanwhile, Italian lawmakers warned against involving SpaceX in an update to the country's satellite program back in July.Speculation that Airbus, Leonardo and Thales would join forces on satellite functions has been building for some time. Back in April, Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani told CNBC he was hopeful the alliance would come to fruition in the coming months.He said at the time that the joint venture would not be specifically designed to challenge Starlink, but to provide a European alternative.watch nowEutelsat has long been vying to become the regional rival to Musk's company. However, its fleet of satellites is vastly overshadowed by Starlink's, with the latter launching its 10,000th satellite into orbit earlier this week. David Barker, investment manager of GAM's European equity team, told CNBC that the joint venture announced on Thursday was \"the first tangible evidence of Europe addressing its waning technological sovereignty since the start of the second Trump administration.\"\"Prior to [this], Europe competed against itself, through three subscale companies against the growing dominance of SpaceX,\" he said. \"We see this as a positive step towards re-establishing Europe's space industry as a global force and also a positive signal that the European project may be able to re-assert itself where it has failed in other areas such as cross-border banking, capital markets and defence consolidation.\" Meanwhile, Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC the move was \"another step in the right direction for Europe.\" \"For Leonardo, Thales, and Airbus, space is a relatively small part of their businesses, but joining forces certainly provides more clout to compete in the global market,\" he said. \"We remain bullish on the aerospace and defense sector in general, with four-star ratings on both Thales and Leonardo.\" — CNBC's Ryan Browne and Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.",

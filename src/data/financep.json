    "body": "An assortment of Bath & Body Works products.Courtesy of Bath & Body WorksBath & Body Works Champagne Toast bodywash, with no minimum shipping threshold, is now just a click away for Amazon Prime members.The mall-favorite brand is making some of its best-selling fragrances, bodywashes, hand soaps and candles available for Amazon's U.S. shoppers. The selection is also eligible for Prime shipping. Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. \"Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer,\" Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. \"It's about meeting them where they already shop.\"The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. Heaf recently laid out his \"plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth.\" He calls it a \"consumer-first formula\" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products; reigniting the brand; winning in the marketplace; and operating with speed and efficiency.The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, \"is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy.\"Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. Now, Heaf says, the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.Amazon: Friend or foe? While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. Gap, J.Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. Gap began selling what it calls \"core basics for the whole family\" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for \"core essentials.\" Under Bath & Body Works' new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J.Crew did not respond to request for comment.Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision-making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. Still, Heaf admits, \"We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 2, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersThe U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers after the Supreme Court ruled Friday in a 6-3 decision that tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, a new estimate says.The potential refunds to a broad range of companies would be for tariffs already collected by the government since Trump slapped on the duties without authorization from Congress.The $175 billion refund estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model was produced at the request of the Reuters news wire service. The model is a nonpartisan fiscal research group at the University of Pennsylvania.Multiple importers already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds of their tariffs, citing lower-court rulings that found Trump's tariffs are not legal.

He was the first president to ever use IEEPA for that purpose.Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three conservative members of the high court to dissent from Friday's ruling, warned about the potential logistical difficulty of having to refund tariffs already collected.\"In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the Court's decision could be substantial,\" Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent.\"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,\" he wrote.\"As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess,'\" Kavanaugh wrote.\"In addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars — including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more,\" he wrote.\"The Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements.\" Brian LeBlanc, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a LinkedIn post Friday said \"we estimate\" that the IEEPA-related tariffs that have been ruled illegal constitute \"roughly 60% of the tariffs issued to date.\"\"That's a big deal. Until President Trump replaces those tariffs with alternative authorities, the tariff rate just dropped from around 9.5% to around 5%,\" LeBlanc wrote. \"Refunds are going to be tricky, and we expect the Trump administration to replace most (but not all) of this lost tariff revenue.\"U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December said the amount of tariffs collected that would be at risk of having to be refunded was $133.5 billion. That tally would have risen since then because of the ongoing collection of duties.",

    "body": "The Supreme Court during a rain storm in Washington, Feb. 20, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump's country-specific \"reciprocal\" tariffs are unconstitutional, delivering a win for many consumer companies facing higher import costs.But the ruling doesn't cover all sectors. The Supreme Court reviewed tariffs enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which the Trump administration used to justify the sweeping tariff agenda. The act had never before been used by a president to impose tariffs.In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\" Still, hours after the ruling, Trump announced a new global 10% tariff, and the Supreme Court's ruling does not cover tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Those duties are intended to target specific products that threaten national security, and they remain in effect after Friday's ruling. Separate from his country-specific rates, Trump has raised tariffs on imports of steel, semiconductors, aluminum and other products deemed to impair national security. Here are the sectors still facing higher levies even after the Supreme Court decision.AutosIt's not immediately clear how much the decision will impact the U.S. and global automotive industry. The industry continues to face billions of dollars in tariff costs, depending on where an imported auto part or vehicle originates.The Trump administration last year broadly implemented 25% tariffs on vehicles and certain auto parts imported into the U.S., citing national security risks. It has since struck independent deals to lower the levies to 10% to 15% with countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan. Others, such as South Korea, have also struck deals for lower rates, but it's unclear if those changes have actually taken effect.\"With today's decision out and subsequent developments, there remain many unknowns and important questions still to be answered. This is not a moment to ease up,\" said Lenny LaRocca, U.S. automotive lead for consulting firm KPMG. \"Automakers should continue planning for multiple scenarios and keep supply chain considerations top of mind as the trade and tariff landscape continues to evolve.\"America's largest automaker, General Motors, last month said it expects between $3 billion and $4 billion in tariff costs this year, and Ford Motor earlier this month said its net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year over year at $2 billion in 2026.Ford told CNBC in a statement that it is continuing to work with the government on policies that \"promote a strong and globally competitive U.S. auto sector.\" GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision.PharmaceuticalsThe pharmaceutical industry is facing a lot of uncertainty over tariffs. Trump has repeatedly threatened tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, though they haven't yet taken effect, in part because of negotiated multiyear deals between the administration and drugmakers. If that were to change, however, pharmaceutical tariffs would still be covered under Section 232.The administration has floated imposing tariffs on the industry that could eventually reach up to 250%. Last July, Trump threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, and the administration has already opened a Section 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals to investigate the impact of imports on national security.The tariff threats are a move to push drug companies to manufacture in the U.S. instead of abroad. In December, multiple companies inked a deal with Trump to voluntarily lower their prices in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma tariffs — as long as they invest further in U.S. manufacturing. That deal included major players like Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and more. FurnitureThe furniture industry found little relief from Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Last fall, items like couches, kitchen cabinets, vanities and more were hit with higher tariffs under Section 232. The roughly 25% duties will remain in place even now that the IEEPA tariffs have been deemed unconstitutional. The furniture industry is already facing greater uncertainty, with the 25% tariff expected to rise to 50% in 2027, and more broad pressures from higher interest rates and inflation. Smaller companies are getting hit the hardest, with fewer resources to work with, while larger companies are facing bankruptcy, like Value City Furniture's parent company, American Signature Furniture, which went out of business late last year.Food and consumer packaged goodsUnder Section 232, steel and aluminum imports into the U.S. are still carry tariffs. With higher aluminum tariffs, companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Keurig Dr Pepper and Reynolds will continue to face higher costs associated with manufacturing their products.Trump hiked aluminum tariffs to 50% last year.Still, some of the key tariffs for the sector have been rolled back, even before Friday's ruling.In November, Trump issued an executive order exempting several hundred agricultural products, including bananas, coffee and spices, from tariffs. And in September, he similarly rescinded a 10% tariff on Brazilian pulp, a key component of paper towels, diapers and toilet paper.— CNBC's Mike Wayland, Annika Kim Constantino, Gabrielle Fonrouge and Amelia Lucas contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Man and boy sit on a paved sidewalk and draw alien faces.Annie Otzen | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to make public government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.Trump said the files that will be identified and released will also concern unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, as well as \"any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.\"In a Truth Social post, the U.S. president said his move was based on the \"tremendous interest\" in the subject, without providing additional details. This comes after he accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of leaking \"classified information\" on aliens. \"I don't know if they're real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Obama said on Saturday in a podcast that aliens were real, \"but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51.\" \"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States,\" Obama added.Area 51 refers to a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, and has been the center of conspiracy theories saying the U.S. government has been conducting research and using the facility for storing extraterrestrial materials and technology. Obama had previously said that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was \"Where are the aliens?\"After the podcast on Sunday, the former U.S. president clarified his stance on a post on Instagram, saying that the universe was so vast that the odds are good that there's life out there. However, he said that he also saw \"no evidence\" during his presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with Earth.\" In late 2024, the Pentagon said it had seen 757 new reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs between May 2023 and June 2024, NBC News reported.Of these, 21 \"merit further analysis\" due to \"anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors,\" the report said, adding that there was no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said Friday he will sign an executive order imposing a new 10% \"global tariff,\" hours after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping \"reciprocal\" import duties in a major rebuke of his trade agenda.The new \"Section 122\" tariffs will come on top of the existing levies that remain intact following the high court's decision, Trump said as he raged at the \"deeply disappointing\" ruling during a White House press briefing.\"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" Trump said.The court's ruling invalidated the legal underpinning of many of the tariffs that Trump insists are essential for the U.S. economy and for rebuilding America's shrinking manufacturing base. Trump was adamant that he will find other ways to impose tariffs without Congress.\"I don't have to,\" Trump said when asked why he did not want to work with the legislative branch. \"I have the right to do tariffs.\"Trump's remarks vacillated between defiant and scathing. He even went after Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated, after they voted with the majority in the 6-3 tariff ruling.\"I think their decision was terrible,\" Trump said. \"I think it's an embarrassment to their families, you want to know the truth. The two of them.\" He said he will sign an order later Friday imposing the new 10% duties, which are being invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Tariffs conjured using that statute can only last for 150 days, with any extension requiring congressional approval.Asked at the press briefing about that time limit and about getting congressional buy-in, Trump said, \"We have the right to do pretty much what we want to do.\"Trump also declared that all the tariffs active under statutes known as Section 232 and Section 301 will remain \"in full force and effect.\"Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsThe Trump administration is also wielding Section 301 to launch several investigations into potentially unfair trade practices, which could result in additional new tariffs, Trump said.The court's ruling struck down the tariffs Trump had invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Trump's reciprocal tariffs and his drug-trafficking-related duties both hinged on that law.The high court majority ruled Friday that IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.\"Most of the U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.Trump said Friday, \"other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected.\"\"We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it,\" he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking at the Economic Club of Dallas shortly after Trump, said that the administration will replace the rejected IEEPA tariffs by leveraging a number of other existing tariff laws.Doing so \"will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026,\" Bessent said. \"No one should expect that the tariff revenue will go down.\"",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

    "body": "World leaders during the G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis, in Alberta, Canada, June 17, 2025.Amber Bracken |ReutersU.S. trading partners offered a cautious welcome to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision Friday to strike down large parts of President Donald Trump's flagship trade policy on global tariffs — but global trade bodies warned of lingering uncertainty surrounding import levies.The law that undergirds the import duties \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited Supreme Court decision.Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiation.A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world\"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,\" the spokesperson said.\"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue.\" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminium, cars and pharmaceuticals.The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.watch nowWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move \"does little to clear the murky waters\" for British businesses, warning that the President still has \"other options at his disposal\" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminium tariffs.  \"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,\" Bain said in a statement. \"For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.\"Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on \"stability and predictability.\" \"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,\" Gill said. \"We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.\"Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"No trade 'win' yetElsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to \"legitimize tariffs,\" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.\"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,\" Swissmem said.\"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,\" Swissmem wrote on X. \"The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.\"The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the \"significant strain\" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.\"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,\" the ICC said.— CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.",

    "body": "Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersA federal judge in Miami denied Tesla's bid to toss out a $243 million verdict in a lawsuit that requires the automaker to compensate the family of a 2019 fatal Autopilot crash victim as well as a survivor.The collision, which occurred in Key Largo, Florida, killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. Tesla owner George McGee was driving his Model S sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system. During the trial, McGee said that when he dropped his phone while driving and scrambled to pick it up, he thought the system would brake if an obstacle was in the way. McGee's car instead accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 mph, hitting a nearby empty parked car as well as Angulo and Benavides, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle. A jury determined last year that Tesla should be held partially responsible for the fatal crash. Tesla filed to appeal the suit, seeking to have the verdict tossed or to proceed with a new trial. In her order out Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom wrote that \"evidence admitted at trial more than supports the jury verdict,\" and there was no error previously, or additional argument introduced justifying a new trial or change to the earlier verdict.\"We are of course pleased, but also completely unsurprised that the honorable Judge Bloom upheld the jury's verdict finding Tesla liable for the integral role Autopilot and the company's misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon,\" Brett Schreiber, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement. Attorneys for Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling marks the latest setback for Elon Musk's automaker as the company tries to play catch-up in the nascent robotaxi market. Tesla is way behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China, as both companies offer commercial ride-hailing services. Musk said last month that Tesla will have a \"widespread\" network of driverless robotaxis in the U.S. by the end of 2026, but the company doesn't yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely and only operates a handful of robotaxis in Austin, Texas.Gibson Dunn, which represented Tesla, had argued that compensatory damages in the Florida case should be steeply reduced from $129 million to no more than $69 million, which would have resulted in Tesla having to pay a $23 million award. The firm also said punitive damages should be eliminated or reduced to, at most, three times compensatory damages due to a statutory cap in the state of Florida.WATCH: Why investors are divided on Tesla's turn to robots and self-driving carswatch now",

Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe private credit boom is facing a new test after Blue Owl Capital permanently restricted withdrawals from one of its retail-focused debt funds.Shares in Blue Owl Capital fell nearly 6% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds.The biggest portion of the sale came from a semi-liquid private credit fund marketed to U.S. retail investors called the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II, which will stop offering quarterly redemption options to investors, reigniting debate over whether stress was beginning to resurface in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing corners.watch now\"This is a canary in the coal mine,\" Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. \"The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.\"The broader concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves, financing smaller, more leveraged companies at yields that appeared attractive compared with public markets, market watchers said.\"Years of ultra-low rates and ultra-low spreads and very few bankruptcies led investors to go further and further out the risk spectrum in credit,\" Rasmussen said. \"This is a classic case of 'fool's yield,' high yield that doesn't translate into high returns because the borrowers were too risky.\"Private credit, which are generally direct loans made by non-bank lenders to companies, have ballooned into a roughly $3 trillion market globally.When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom.Michael ShumCascade DebtPublicly traded business development companies, or BDCs, which are investment vehicles that lend to small and mid-sized private companies and are a major part of the private credit market, are increasingly funded by retail investors rather than institutions, according to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. The Fuqua research, which was published last September, showed that institutional ownership of BDC shares has steadily declined over time, falling to about 25% on average by 2023.\"This trend indicates that retail investors are playing an increasingly large role in supplying equity capital to publicly traded BDC,\" the researchers pointed out.In 2025, the eight largest members of the S&P BDC Index offered dividend yields which can go up to 16%, with Blue Owl's at over 11%. For comparison, the S&P Global's U.S. high yield corporate bond index 1-year, 3-year and 5-year returns stand at around 7.7%, 9% and 4%, respectively.\"The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans. They are, by their nature, somewhat risky,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\"Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds,\" he added.Rising risks?Private credit concerns recently resurfaced after investors grew uneasy that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software models, a major borrower group of the industry, adding to existing concerns in over rising leverage, murky valuations and the possibility that isolated borrower stress could reveal deeper systemic weaknesses. The First Brands Group collapse last September brought to fore risks in private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were \"hiding in plain sight,\" warning that \"cockroaches\" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.The fundamental problem private market deals have is multi-year commitments that don't line up with quarterly redemptions, said Michael Shum, CEO of Cascade Debt, which builds infrastructure software for private credit and asset-based lenders.\"When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom,\" he said.Blue Owl did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announces new nutrition policies during a press conference in Washington, Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. \"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,\" he said. \"We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.\"But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. \"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,\" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. \"The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.\"Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he \"can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.\"\"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,\" Cook said. \"If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.\"Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing \"an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.\"Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.\"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,\" the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. \"This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.\"House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.",

    "body": "Customers at a Ford dealership in Richmond, California, April 16, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — The strength of the U.S. automotive industry will face an early test this spring that has nothing to do with cars or trucks.With tax season starting, industry experts are projecting that some Americans, many of whom have been priced out of the new-vehicle market, will use anticipated higher tax returns to purchase a new or used vehicle.Extra cash on hand could lend a needed boost to an industry that's suffering from slowing vehicle sales — or it could reveal continued problems for the automotive industry with inflated prices and consumers still reluctant to spend on big-ticket items.\"Their new tax bill is actually going to be less, and they're going to be getting more in their tax return. It's going to be a little bit of a surprise, we think, for a lot of potential buyers out there,\" said Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough at a recent auto analyst conference.The average IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, compared with the same point in 2025, according to early filing data. As of Feb. 6, the average refund amount was $2,290, compared with $2,065 reported about one year prior.The increases were expected under tax changes by the Trump administration, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July. That legislation removed taxes on overtime and tips and allowed eligible taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in annual interest paid on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles purchased, among other adjustments. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto dealer stocksMany of the tax changes were made retroactive to January 2025, which means taxpayers may have withheld more than they will ultimately owe.\"Although it's a bit of an unknown, it feels like it could be really beneficial to vehicle sales, particularly in that sort of Q1-Q2 time frame,\" said David Oakley, GlobalData manager of Americas vehicle sales forecasts.March is historically one of the top months for U.S. vehicle sales, especially for used vehicles. The month has represented 9.1% of annual new vehicle sales on average over the past 12 years, according to Cox, trailing only the month of December at 9.3% of sales. Many of the recent tax changes also assist middle- and higher-income consumers who may decide to pull ahead a vehicle purchase. The industry saw a similar dynamic during the Covid pandemic when the Trump administration issued many Americans $1,400 stimulus checks.Back then, though, federal interest rates were near zero compared to the current Federal Reserve funds rate of 3.5% to 3.75%, and the inventory of new vehicles was low. Now, with higher borrowing costs, but improved inventory, the equation could be different. More buyers are agreeing to longer-term loans amid higher financing costs and prices. Putting down extra cash can help lower monthly payments, which Carmax's Edmunds reports reached a record of $772 per month for new vehicles during the fourth quarter.The average transaction price for new vehicles in the U.S. was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from the start of 2020, according to Cox.\"What we don't know is with consumer finance so stressed already, is that extra money already spent? Whether that's going to be in the pockets. It's a really mixed bag out there,\" Chesbrough said. Consumers could choose to use higher tax returns to pay off credit card debt — which nationally stands at a record level of $1.28 trillion, according to a report last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — or replenish their savings after a period of persistent inflation. U.S. consumer confidence fell to 84.5 in January, the lowest level since May 2014, driven by intense anxiety over high prices and a weakening labor market.\"It's only confident people, people who feel comfortable about their economic fortunes of the economy of the United States, that are going to be interested in taking out a $40,000 or $50,000 auto loan,\" Chesbrough said. \"It's a very difficult situation right now.\"— CNBC's Kate Dore contributed to this report.",

Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats rejoiced on Friday and Republicans remained divided in the wake of a momentous Supreme Court decision striking down a large portion of President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\"Trump's chaotic and illegal tariff tax made life more expensive and our economy more unstable. Families paid more. Small businesses and farmers got squeezed. Markets swung wildly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement after the decision. \"We've said from day one: a president cannot ignore Congress and unilaterally slap tariffs on Americans. That overreach failed.\"The ruling is a major hit to Trump, who used a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to slap a barrage of tariffs on American trading partners. Tariffs and the economy more broadly will be a key messaging issue for Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections. Primaries start next month leading up to the November general election.The Supreme Court decision sets up additional potential showdowns in Congress over how to handle Trump's trade war after the U.S. House voted last week to overturn tariffs on Canada.Read more CNBC coverage on tariffsSupreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs in rebuke of signature policyTrump tariffs: U.S. could owe $175 billion in refundsWhat the Supreme Court tariff ruling may mean for your moneySmall furniture retailers face existential tariff threat, despite Supreme Court rulingU.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump’s tariffsFor Republicans, Trump's tariffs, which have proven largely unpopular in a pivotal election year, are a more complicated issue.\"SCOTUS's outrageous ruling handcuffs our fight against unfair trade that has devastated American workers for decades. These tariffs protected jobs, revived manufacturing, and forced cheaters like China to pay up,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, posted to X. \"This betrayal must be reversed and Republicans must get to work immediately on a reconciliation bill to codify the tariffs that had made our country the hottest country on earth!\" Moreno continued.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has voted with Democrats in opposition to Trump's tariffs, celebrated the decision. He and other opponents of the trade policy have argued that it is Congress, not the president, that has the constitutional authority to enact taxes and tariffs.\"In defense of our Republic, the Supreme Court struck down using emergency powers to enact taxes,\"  Paul posted on X. \"This ruling will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism.\"The court ruled a little over a week after a small group of House Republicans joined most of their Democratic colleagues to overturn Trump's 35% tariff of Canada, though the resolution was largely symbolic since it would require approval from the Senate and the White House to take effect.Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., one of the six Republicans who voted to overturn the tariffs, called the decision \"a common-sense and straightforward ruling by the Supreme Court.\"\"The Constitution's checks and balances still work. Article One gives tariff authority to Congress,\" Bacon wrote on X. \"In the future, Congress should defend its own authorities and not rely on the Supreme Court.\"Some Democrats suggested Trump would look for other mechanism to impose tariffs, while some Republicans said that he should do so.\"Good news today. The Supreme Court has struck down many of Trump's tariffs. Sadly, this President is absolutely dedicated to making you pay these taxes. He's going to try other ways to keep them in place,\" Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said in a post to X. \"I will continue voting to block Trump's reckless tariffs in the Senate.\"In the House, Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., touted his legislation, dubbed the RELIEF Act, that would trigger tariff refunds to small businesses.\"These taxes stole money from working families and small businesses who were forced to pay them from the very beginning. Now, it's time to start repairing the economic damage these Trump taxes have caused,\" Horsford posted to X.The legislation is symbolic because its success would require significant Republican buy-in in the GOP-controlled House and Senate. And many allies of Trump suggested the Supreme Court decision would not be the end of the president's tariff agenda.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump prepares to board Air Force One en route to Florida, at Pope Army Airfield at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Feb. 13, 2026.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

    "body": "People walk near a sign outside of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. \"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,\" spokesman José Castañeda said. The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. Alleged efforts to concealAuthorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. \"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.",

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign is seen at an AutoZone on Feb. 11, 2026 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWith the upheaval of the Covid pandemic came opportunity, as a shift in the labor market gave workers unprecedented opportunities for mobility and a chance to climb the pay scale.The \"great resignation,\" as it came to be known, saw record numbers of employees quit in favor of better opportunities, as companies couldn't hire workers fast enough to fill the vacancies that the pandemic helped create. A record 4.5 million left their jobs for greener pastures in March 2022. But that is changing.The level of \"quits\" as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has contracted by nearly one-third since hitting its peak in early 2022, a period during which job openings have nearly halved. One metric helps further tell the story: During the same period, the disparity between average annual pay increases for those staying in their jobs and for those leaving has all but collapsed, going from a peak of 8.4 percentage points in April 2022 to 1.9 percentage points in January. That's the lowest level since payrolls processing firm ADP began tracking the data in November 2020.Call it the \"big stay,\" or just another outgrowth of the low-hire, low-fire labor market, but it's a trend that has significance for workers.A pendulum swing\"It's a very stable labor market. There's very little hiring, very little firing,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"It's an outgrowth of the pandemic from where it was all hands on deck.\"A lack of labor supply and a pernicious skills gap was the story when the economy was trying to recover from the massive drawdown it had seen during the early Covid days. Workers and employers were adjusting to the new world of hybrid work, and companies were hungry for new recruits.As the \"great resignation\" peaked, there were more than two job openings per each worker the BLS classified as unemployed. That pendulum has swung back, however, and there are now more available workers than openings.watch nowLayoffs, though, remain low. Last week saw just 206,000 initial jobless claims, with the longer-term average at 219,000, about in line with historical norms for a healthy labor market. Though hiring has slowed considerably, the unemployment rate is just 4.3%. \"If you were to parachute into this labor market in any time period of the United States, you'd be mostly happy with what you found,\" Richardson said. \"The action is in the granular data.\"For instance, pay trends are peculiar to industries. In the high-turnover leisure and hospitality industry, pay gains are better for job stayers, with the disparity at 2.5% in stayers' favor, according to ADP. However, construction, which is struggling with labor supply during the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, has a 6.6 percentage point advantage for switchers.The incentives are still strong for switchers, with annual pay growth averaging 6.4% in January, well above the 4.5% for stayers, according to ADP data. But the gap is narrowing and could close further due to current labor market moves.A new realityThe trends come with a fresh flock of workers combing the want ads for jobs.Searches were up 31% in January from December while job postings were little changed, according to Indeed Hiring Lab.\"The reality facing those seeking jobs in 2026 is that openings per unemployed person have declined, and hiring timelines are lengthening,\" Indeed experts Laura Ullrich and Sneha Puri wrote. \"While some sectors continue to see elevated levels of postings, the macro environment remains in the low-hire, low-fire stagnation of 2025.\"Even with the low unemployment rate, Richardson said she is concerned with the \"lack of dynamism in the labor market\" as most hires are in the health-care industry and turnover is receding.\"The fact that it is low-hire, low-fire is actually not a great state to be in. The churn is important to the productivity growth,\" she said. \"You want to see the most talented go to the places where that talent is the most rewarded. And if we are in this really stable period, that means that talent is not being repositioned to its best use.\"",

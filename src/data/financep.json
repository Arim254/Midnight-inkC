    "body": "Ford Mustangs at a used car dealership in Montebello, California, May 5, 2025.Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Prices of used vehicles are expected to rise this year but at a historically stable rate, according to auto data and insights firm Cox Automotive.Cox on Thursday forecast that wholesale prices on its Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index will end this year 2% higher than December 2025. The index tracks prices of used vehicles sold at its U.S. wholesale auctions. This year's increase would compare with 0.4% increases during each of the past two years following declines of 7% and nearly 15% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, from inflated prices during the Covid-19 pandemic. Used vehicle prices during that time increased at historically high rates of 46.6% in 2021 and 14.2% in 2020.The overall stability in pricing is a win for potential car buyers. However, used vehicle prices are still higher than they were before the pandemic. Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years.The average index move at the end of each year is an increase of roughly 2%, according to Cox data going back to 1998. That excludes the outlier years of 2021 and 2022.Pricing will fluctuate month to month due to selling seasonality and other factors. A regular month-to-month move in the index during the year is only 0.2%, Cox said.\"As we move into 2026, a few positive indicators are emerging: New and used auto loan rates have fallen to the lowest level in a year, and consumers will soon see increased tax refunds hit their wallets,\" Jeremy Robb, Cox Automotive interim chief economist, said in a statement. \"As this plays out, we are expecting to see stronger demand in the auto market as the year gets underway.\"Used vehicle sales year over year are expected to fall by 0.9% to 38.3 million in 2026, according to Cox. That forecast includes 20.3 million used vehicle retail sales, a 0.7% decrease.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Jan. 6, 2026.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.Wall Street goes shopping in the Sun BeltThose concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. \"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,\" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. \"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,\" BTIG said in a note. Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Members of law enforcement investigate the scene after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 7, 2026.Stephen Maturen | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA Minnesota law enforcement agency said Thursday that the FBI is blocking the agency from accessing evidence related to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on a residential street in Minneapolis.The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI's stance came at the behest of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota and was a reversal of an initial agreement that the BCA would conduct a joint investigation of Good's killing with the FBI. BCA Superintendent Drew Evans also said the agency has \"reluctantly withdrawn\" from the investigation because of the lack of cooperation from federal officials.\"We expect the FBI to conduct a thorough and complete investigation and that the full investigative file will be shared with the appropriate prosecutorial authorities at both the state and federal levels,\" Evans said.Good was shot by an ICE agent who had positioned himself in front of her SUV as she began driving away from another agent who had grabbed her driver's side door and reached inside in an apparent attempt to pull her out of the vehicle. Good seconds earlier had been ordered by an ICE agent to exit the vehicle, which was stopped in the middle of a road that an ICE truck was driving down.The apparent reversal by federal law enforcement authorities came as the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, has accused Good, a 37-year-old mother, of engaging in domestic terrorism and of intentionally trying to run down ICE agents with her SUV.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democrats have blasted those claims, saying video of the shooting contradicts the narrative being promoted by DHS, Vice President JD Vance, and others.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking at a press conference Thursday, said the BCA has \"not been cut out\" of the probe.\"They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation,\" Noem said.Walz said Thursday, \"I think it's clear to everyone, as they saw this, that it feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation.\"\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome, and I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice president to Kristy Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,\" Walz said at a press conference.A person visits a makeshift memorial for Renee Nicole Good, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 8, 2026. Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car.Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesIn a statement, Evans said that shortly after Good was shot, the BCA consulted with \"the Hennepin County  Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI.\"\"It was decided that the BCA Force Investigations Unit would conduct a joint investigation with the FBI. The BCA responded promptly to the scene and began coordinating investigative work in good faith,\" Evans said.\"Later that afternoon, the FBI informed the BCA that the U.S. Attorney's Office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,\" Evans said.\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,\" he said. \"As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.\"\"If the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI were to reconsider this approach and express a willingness to resume a joint investigation, the BCA is prepared to reengage in support of our shared goal of public safety in Minnesota,\" he said.— CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this story.",

The move came less than a week after Trump authorized a strike that captured the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.The measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, only needed a simple majority to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and would require Trump to seek the approval of Congress before using the U.S. military again in Venezuela. The measure was brought by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. The vote in the Senate was procedural, but it indicates that the measure has the votes to pass when it comes to a final vote in the Senate. It would then go to the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority.Later Thursday, Trump railed against the five Republicans who helped Democrats pass the measure.\"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.The five GOP senators — Paul, Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Indiana's Todd Young — \"should never be elected to office again,\" Trump wrote.Collins, responding to Trump's post, told reporters on Capitol Hill, \"I guess that means he would prefer to have [Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet] Mills or somebody else with whom he's not had a great relationship.\"Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

Maduro is now facing drug-related charges in New York. The Senate shot down a similar resolution in November, after only two Republicans — Paul and Murkowski —  joined all Democrats in voting for it. Trump engaged in a monthslong military buildup around Venezuela before the action that captured Maduro.Collins, in a statement after the vote, said, \"While I support the operation to seize Nicolas Maduro, which was extraordinary in its precision and complexity, I do not support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization.\"— CNBC's Justin Papp and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.",

Foley Federal Courthouse in Albany, N.Y. Will Waldron | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesA judge disqualified a federal prosecutor from overseeing investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling Thursday that he had been serving in his post unlawfully when he requested subpoenas.U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield blocked subpoenas requested by John Sarcone, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York.The judge said the Department of Justice did not follow statutory procedure after judges declined to extend Sarcone's tenure. \"When the Executive branch of government skirts restraints put in place by Congress and then uses that power to subject political adversaries to criminal investigations, it acts without lawful authority. Subpoenas issued under that authority are invalid. The subpoenas are quashed, and Mr. Sarcone is disqualified from further participation in the underlying investigations.\"James, a Democrat, had challenged Sarcone's authority after he issued subpoenas seeking information about lawsuits she filed against President Donald Trump, claiming he had committed fraud in his business dealings, and separately against the National Rifle Association and some of its former leaders.Justice Department lawyers say Sarcone was appointed properly and that the subpoenas were valid. James claims the inquiry into her lawsuits is part of a campaign of baseless investigations and prosecutions of Trump's perceived enemies.The judge said the Justice Department did not follow statutory procedure after judges declined to extend Sarcone's tenure. \"Instead, on the same day that the judges declined to extend Mr. Sarcone's appointment, the Department took coordinated steps — through personnel moves and shifting titles — to install Mr. Sarcone as Acting U.S. Attorney. Federal law does not permit such a workaround.\"James' office issued a statement calling Thursday's ruling \"an important win for the rule of law.\"\"We will continue to defend our office's successful litigation from this administration's political attacks,\" the statement said.Attorney General Letitia James listens as New York Gov.

Habba resigned the next week.In November, a federal judge in Virginia dismissed indictments brought there against James and former FBI Director James Comey. That judge said the interim U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.Lindsey Halligan, outside of the White House, Aug. 20, 2025, in Washington.Jacquelyn Martin | APAlso, a federal judge in Nevada in September disqualified from several cases the Trump administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there. And a federal judge in Los Angeles disqualified the acting U.S. attorney in Southern California from several cases after concluding he had stayed in the job longer than allowed by law.In New York, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in March. But when his 120-day term elapsed, judges in the district declined to keep him in the post.Bondi then appointed Sarcone as a special attorney and designated him first assistant U.S. attorney for the district, moves that federal officials say allows him to serve as an acting U.S. attorney.James' lawyers called the maneuvers an end-run around federal law. They claimed that because Sarcone lacks legitimate authority to act as U.S. attorney, the subpoenas should be blocked. The lawyers argued that Sarcone should be disqualified.Federal lawyers argued in court that the U.S. attorney general has broad authority to appoint attorneys within her department and to delegate her functions to those attorneys.Sarcone was part of Trump's legal team during the 2016 presidential campaign and worked for the U.S. General Services Administration as the regional administrator for the Northeast and Caribbean during Trump's first term.",

    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could rule on the legality of President Donald Trump's tariffs, a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on not only trade policy, but also the U.S. fiscal situation.Though it's not certain that the high court will make its ruling, it has scheduled Friday as a \"decision day\" for handing down opinions, and there is widespread speculation that the tariff case will come up.At its core, the ruling will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 another another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts see \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations on some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009 as U.S., a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks during a press conference to unveil the official Trump Accounts website, at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 17, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday pressed the administration's desire for lower interest rates, saying they are the key to future economic growth.In a speech he will deliver before the Economic Club of Minnesota, Bessent backed President Donald Trump's economic agenda and said easier monetary policy will help pave the way for gains ahead.\"Cutting interest rates will have a tangible impact on the lives of every Minnesotan,\" he said, according to excerpts obtained in an official draft from an administration source. \"It is the only ingredient missing for even stronger economic growth. Which is why the Fed should not delay.\"However, a subsequent draft of the speech, after this article was published, omitted the language and instead merely called on the Fed to \"do its part to spur investment.\"\"I believe the Fed needs to have merely an open mind. The open-mind maestro, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, resisted premature rate hikes during the technology boom of the 1990s—and history proved him right,\" Bessent said.The Federal Reserve approved three consecutive interest rate cuts in the final four months of 2025, totaling 0.75 percentage point and taking the central bank's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.However, the pace of reductions is expected to slow considerably this year, with markets pricing in just two cuts and the most recent projections from Fed officials pointing to just one. One wild card in that equation is that the Fed will get a new chair this year, a process that Bessent is overseeing. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May, and the Treasury secretary has whittled down the candidates to five. National Economic Council leader Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are the two betting favorites to get the position.While lower interest rates carry the threat of reigniting inflation, they also could help support a slowing labor market.\"In 2025, the President laid the foundation for robust economic growth with: the historic passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, trade deals that rewrote decades of global misalignment; and an ambitious deregulation agenda that empowered American entrepreneurs and businesses,\" Bessent said. \"Now, in 2026, we will reap the rewards of President Trump's America First agenda.\"Bessent will deliver the speech at 12:45 p.m. ET.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Kevin Hassett is leader of the National Economic Council.

Both bills passed unanimously by voice vote in the House and the Senate. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill infuriated some Republicans from the state, including the bill's sponsor Rep. Lauren Boebert, a close Trump ally. The bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, would reduce the payments local communities must make for the construction of a pipeline set to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado. \"This bill makes good ... on President Trump's commitment to rural communities,\" Boebert said Thursday in remarks on the House floor ahead of the vote.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

A two-thirds majority is needed in both chambers to override a veto.The House will separately vote on whether to override Trump's veto of the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act. The bill would transfer a tract of land in Florida known as the Osceola Camp in the Everglades National Park to the reserved area for the Miccosukee Tribe. It would require the Interior Department to help flood-proof structures in the area. Trump said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"The administration said in statements of policy that it \"strongly opposes\" both veto overrides. Some Republicans, including Rep. Randy Fine, a Republican from Florida, indicated they would follow the White House's marching orders to not overturn the veto. \"I support the president, so I'm not going to vote to override him,\" Fine said in an interview with CNBC.

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a briefing at the White House in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersNew federal dietary recommendations have sparked mixed reactions from the embattled restaurant industry, as changing guidelines could encourage Americans to dine out less often or choose from a smaller pool of restaurants when they do leave home.The departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled the nutrition guidelines on Wednesday. The recommendations, which are updated every five years, pushed for higher consumption of protein and full-fat dairy and reduced intake of processed foods and sugary drinks. The guidelines are primarily a public health tool for federal agencies, health-care providers and nutrition experts, so it's unclear how much they will influence individual consumer choices. Although the recommendations largely focus on eating at home, they lightly touched on the restaurant industry as well.\"When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options,\" the guidelines advise.While the recommendations could discourage Americans from spending at restaurants — especially at a time when high inflation has curbed trips to dine out — some pockets of the industry had a positive reaction to the changes. The changes could give a particular boost to struggling fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle, which have long touted the type of natural ingredients championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make American Healthy Again\" movement.One lobbying executive who represents restaurant companies, whose organization was involved in meetings with the White House on the new guidelines, said the outcome could have been \"far worse\" for the sector. The person, who declined to be named because their organization was involved in private discussions, said the end result was better for the industry than proposed guidance from earlier in 2025 was. However, the executive said they are still concerned the guidelines could encourage Americans to eat at home when diners have affordable options to incorporate those foods at restaurants. That implication could also ruffle feathers among restaurant chains and their franchisees.Despite those potential concerns from some, industry lobbying group the National Restaurant Association backed the new guidelines.\"Now, more than ever, restaurant operators are offering a wider variety of options, allowing consumers to choose what best fits their dietary needs, preferences, and lifestyles. We congratulate Secretary Kennedy and the Trump Administration on the release of the new guidelines and look forward to continued collaboration with policymakers to ensure that nutrition guidance remains practical, flexible, and supportive of access and innovation,\" National Restaurant Association spokesman Sean Kennedy said in a statement to CNBC. Restaurant franchise lobbyist the International Franchise Association, called the approach \"nuanced\" and said it may limit the number of price increases restaurants have to make. \"Fortunately, the more nuanced approach of these guidelines helps ensure our members will not have to raise prices and that consumers can continue to make their own choices,\" the group said. \"Any future regulations or guidance must keep potential cost increases top of mind, as restaurant owners already face numerous regulatory burdens and supply chain challenges, which most often disproportionately affect small business owners, like franchisees, and ultimately, American consumers.\"How fast casual could benefitSome of the most supportive reactions came from chains that had been beaten down in 2025, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Both fast-casual names saw pullbacks from younger consumers who continue to struggle in a K-shaped economy, where spending has concentrated more among the highest earners.Sweetgreen, which was the biggest restaurant sector laggard last year with a nearly 80% stock decline, cheered the new guidelines. A spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We keep ultra-processed ingredients and added sugars out of our restaurants, source transparently from partners we know and trust, and cook our food from scratch. That is why we are excited to see the new Food Pyramid so clearly emphasizing whole, real, and unprocessed foods.\"Sweetgreen founder and CEO Jonathan Neman wrote on X, \"The U.S. government is for the 1st time urging Americans to avoid highly processed food, added sugar, and refined carbohydrates. Today, the government finally told the American people the truth. Avoid highly processed food (which is 70% of a child's diet). Avoid refined carbohydrates.  CELEBRATE REAL FOOD… LFG!\"Chipotle debuted a High Protein Menu with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillSimilarly, Chipotle, which recently debuted a high-protein and GLP-1-friendly menu, told CNBC it has already catered to similar dietary guidelines.\"Our menu of real ingredients makes it easy to follow the new dietary guidelines that prioritize high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains — while limiting highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates,\" Chipotle spokeswoman Laurie Schalow said in a statement. \"With real food made from wholesome ingredients — without artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives — Chipotle offers choices that fit a balanced, modern approach to eating.\" The company's stock was down nearly 40% in 2025, but some Wall Street analysts have pointed to it as a potential winner in the new GLP-1 landscape, where users of the drugs often opt for smaller portions with more protein.Kennedy has spearheaded the MAHA platform, championing a diet based on whole foods to prevent chronic disease. At times, his beliefs, like his advocacy for beef tallow and encouragement of more red meat in diets, have run afoul of both public health experts and industry players, like McDonald's. Kennedy's criticism of processed foods has put fast-food chains on the defensive, although President Donald Trump is a vocal and loyal fan, particularly of McDonald's.",

Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, part of a bipartisan Senate working group negotiating a deal on the ACA tax credits, told reporters on Wednesday. \"It probably wouldn't be put on the floor, because why waste floor time on something we've already considered?\"In a gaggle on the Hill, Moreno said the House bill is useful in the sense that it can serve as a vehicle for the Senate working group to amend. Members of that group, including Moreno and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have said they are closing in on a deal that would extend the tax credits for two years, though several key sticking points remain.Among them is the Hyde Amendment, a decades old policy that prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions, which many Republicans want to strengthen. President Donald Trump earlier this week told Republicans to be \"flexible\" on Hyde, prompting some pushback from within the GOP ranks.\"We don't do federal funding for abortions,\" Moreno said. \"That's a long-standing tradition, nobody's looking to change that.\"The Thursday vote on the House floor came after four moderate Republicans broke ranks at the end of last year and signed on to a Democrat-led discharge petition to force a vote on the ACA subsidies.A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows members of the House to circumvent leadership and force a vote on the floor if a majority of lawmakers sign on.The discharge petition, introduced by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., cleared a procedural hurdle Wednesday, with nine Republicans joining all Democrats voting in favor of the measure, despite opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.",

Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesAnnounced layoffs fell sharply in December, hitting a 17-month low in a potential sign that the labor market is at least stabilizing, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.Planned job cuts totaled 35,553 for the month, a 50% slide from November and an 8% decrease from the same period a year ago. This was the lowest total since July 2024 in a year dominated by large layoffs and worries over the jobs picture.\"While December is typically slow, this coupled with higher hiring plans, is a positive sign after a year of high job cutting plans,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.For the full year, employers announced more than 1.2 million cuts, up 58% from a year ago and the highest level since the pandemic year of 2020. Even with the tame December level, this was the worst fourth quarter since 2008.Companies also announced plans to hire 10,496 workers, up nearly 16% from November and 31% from a year ago.While Challenger's numbers have reflected a big pickup this year in layoffs, that hasn't showed up in government statistics.Weekly initial jobless claims have been stable through most of the year albeit with occasional spikes. The most recent reporting period showed claims at 208,000. The four-week moving average of claims is at its lowest since April 27, 2024, according to the Labor Department.However, hiring also has been weak, with monthly payroll growth averaging just 55,000. December payroll growth is expected to total 73,000, according to the Dow Jones consensus. That report will be released Friday.",

    "body": "A 3D-printed miniature model of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and the Greenland flag are seen in this illustration taken January 15, 2025. Dado Ruvic | ReutersGreenland's icy landscape may not match its name, but its potential value certainly does.President Donald Trump is, once again, openly pining for the U.S. to take over Greenland. His administration says it's weighing a range of options to acquire the Danish island territory, including using the U.S. military or buying it outright.Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have repeatedly stated that Greenland is not for sale. But Trump's rhetoric about Greenland has flared back up in the days since the U.S. military entered Venezuela and captured that country's leader.The prospect of the U.S. buying Greenland is \"currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he plans to discuss Greenland with Danish officials next week. Trump has not made an official offer, nor has he said what he believes would be a fair price for the territory. If Denmark reversed its opposition to selling Greenland, that land likely wouldn't come cheap. Even some conservative estimates suggest that the island could have a price tag in the hundreds of billions of dollars or higher.Prior Greenland bidsThe lowest guesses come from a direct comparison with history. The U.S. has previously considered buying Greenland, and in 1946 made a formal offer of $100 million —nearly $1.7 billion today. That offer, which Denmark rejected, at the time amounted to 0.04% of U.S. GDP; that proportion today would equal around $1.2 billion.But multiple analysts believe an accurate valuation would be much, much higher.\"Something in the trillions looks about right,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, in an interview.His group sought to calculate a ballpark price for Greenland by looking both at its natural resource reserves and its potential real estate value.The value of its known critical mineral and energy resources alone totaled more than $4.4 trillion, according to the study, which was published in January 2025 and cited data from geological surveys in the U.S., Denmark and Greenland.That figure falls to $2.7 trillion when excluding oil and natural gas, which Greenland stopped issuing exploration licenses for in 2021, citing environmental concerns.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep. Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ousterNot all of that value is ripe for the taking, however: Greenland's frigid conditions and small population of about 57,000 people mean the territory has a low \"resource-to-reserve conversion rate,\" the study said.For example, while Greenland boasts more than 36 million metric tons of known rare earths, its reserves total just 1.5 million tons — a conversion rate of just 4.2%. If that rate is applied across the board, AAF's study shrinks Greenland's value to $186 billion, though it calls that figure its \"lower bound\" estimate.But Trump has recently stated that he primarily wants Greenland for its perceived national security benefits, not solely its economic potential.\"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" Trump said Sunday. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.\"The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, but securing the island could give the U.S. a much stronger foothold in the Arctic. It could also give the U.S. more access to the shipping lanes that are emerging in the planet's northernmost latitudes as a result of climate change, experts have said.To determine Greenland's potential value based on its strategic location, the AAF study compared it with a similarly situated country: Iceland.It would cost the U.S. $1.28 million per square kilometer to buy all the real estate on Iceland, for a total of $131 billion, the according to the study.Applying that same price per square kilometer to Greenland — the world's largest island — results in an estimated total value of nearly $2.8 trillion, AAF found.Other pricey estimatesThat number is higher than some previous analyses. The Financial Times' Alphaville valued Greenland at a \"very conservative\" $1.1 trillion in 2019, when Trump's interest in acquiring the territory first came to light.Iwan Morgan, emeritus professor at University College of London's Institute of the Americas, told CNN that year that Greenland's cost could hit the trillions, while stressing the immense political and legal complexity of any such deal.Former New York Federal Reserve economist David Barker, however, last January valued Greenland between $12.5 billion and $77 billion. To find those numbers, Barker looked at America's prior acquisitions of Alaska and the U.S. Virgin Islands and adjusted those prices based on GDP growth.But Holtz-Eakin told CNBC that he believes AAF's estimate is conservative.\"They're pricing the economics of it. But let's face it, this is not about economics,\" he said. \"What price do you put on our standing in NATO or the global order? I put a big price on that.\"— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC in an interview.Deals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Ólafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, mentioning Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, told CNBC: \"The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.\"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.\"CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.Ólafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.watch nowGreenland's critical mineralsThe White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals.Rare-earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the territory.Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about \"critical minerals.\"Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Ólafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.He said that \"one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,\" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near \"deep fjords,\" meaning they could be easier to ship. Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.",

Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with,\" Vance wrote in a tweet.The vice president was responding to a civil liberties attorney who had said video showed that immigration officers instigated the confrontation with Good.\"The gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job,\" Vance wrote. \"She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him.\"Good, 37, was shot on Wednesday as she began driving away from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a residential street after agents told her to get out of her SUV, which had been blocking the road they were driving down. An agent who positioned himself in front of her car just before she moved shot at her several times as the SUV moved toward him.Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Good, who has a young son, was engaged in \"domestic terrorism,\" and that she was intentionally trying to mow down ICE agents.Minnesota Gov.

He discharged his weapon in self defense, and other angles of the video show the woman *clearly* hit the officer with her car while accelerating.\"The Democratic National Committee's X account, in a reply to Vance, said, \"We all know what we saw.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, at a press conference on Thursday morning, reportedly said, \"The killing of Renee Nicole Good was an abomination, a disgrace, and blood is clearly on the hands of those individuals within the administration who have been pushing an extreme policy that has nothing to do with immigration enforcement connected to removing violent felons from this country.\"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said that in watching the video of Good being shot, \"You felt like your stomach was being punched.\"\"Looking at the video, there seemed no justification for what these agents did,\" Schumer said at a press conference with Jeffries, according to NBC News.\"There needs to be a full investigation at the federal level, although I have little faith in the FBI of doing a fair investigation or DHS, but at the local level as well.\"Meanwhile, a GoFundMe set up to support Good's wife and son had reached nearly $540,000 in donations by 11 a.m. ET Thursday.",

    "body": "Semiconductor stocks rose on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump praised Intel and its CEO.Intel shares rose 2% in extended trading on Thursday after Trump said he had \"a great meeting with the very successful Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan\" in a post on Truth Social. It was last seen 2.63% higher in early pre-market trading Friday.Other chip and AI-related names saw an uplift as investors digested Trump's post. Broadcom and Micron rose 1.66% and 1.36% in pre-market, respectively. AMD gained 0.36%.\"The United States Government is proud to be a Shareholder of Intel, and has already made, through its U.S.A. ownership position, Tens of Billions of Dollars for the American People — IN JUST FOUR MONTHS,\" Trump wrote.\"We made a GREAT Deal, and so did Intel. Our Country is determined to bring leading edge Chip Manufacturing back to America, and that is exactly what is happening!!!\"The U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel through an $8.9 billion investment from the CHIPS and Science Act in August, which had otherwise been struggling.Intel's share price has risen 75% since the Trump administration announced its stake in the company, which also made the U.S. government its majority shareholder. Outside the U.S., European names ASML, which manufactures machines needed to make advanced computer chips, and ASMI, which makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, advanced 5.37% and 4.53% respectively on Friday.Elsewhere, memory chip firms also rallied at the start of the year as a core component to the training and running of artificial intelligence. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump said Friday his administration will take action on Greenland \"whether they like it or not,\" further escalating his rhetoric as he pushes to acquire the Danish territory for the U.S.\"I would like to make a deal, you know, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.The comments came during a meeting with oil executives to discuss the prospect of doing business in Venezuela. Less than a week earlier, the U.S. military invaded the oil-rich South American nation and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro.Trump has long sought to take over Greenland, primarily citing the Arctic island's importance for U.S. national security. Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have pushed back, reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. But the Trump administration nevertheless says it is currently weighing a range of options on Greenland, including utilizing the U.S. military or cutting a deal to purchase it from Denmark.Government officials have also mulled sending lump sums of cash to Greenlanders in order to sway them to join the U.S., Reuters reported Thursday.Asked on Friday how much those payments could be, Trump said, \"I'm not talking about money for Greenland, yet.\"\"I might talk about that, but right now we are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" Trump said.\"Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\" he said.Trump said that while he is a \"big fan\" of Denmark, \"the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. [I'm] sure we had lots of boats go there also.\"\"So we're going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult,\" he said.The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, and it reportedly has the ability to expand its presence there if desired.But that isn't enough, Trump said.\"When we own it, we defend it. You don't defend leases the same way, you have to own it,\" he said.",

    "body": "SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attend an event to pitch AI for businesses in Tokyo, Japan Feb. 3, 2025.Kim Kyung-Hoon | ReutersOpenAI and SoftBank announced plans to invest $1 billion in SB Energy as part of a strategic partnership that will support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.The partnership is part of the $500 billion Stargate commitment that OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle announced last January at the White House, according to a Friday release. As part of the agreement, SB Energy will build and operate OpenAI's 1.2 gigawatt data center site in Milam County, Texas that was announced in September. \"Partnering with SB Energy brings together their strength in data center infrastructure and energy development and OpenAI's deep domain expertise in data center engineering,\" Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, said in a statement on Friday. \"The result is a fast, reliable way to scale compute through large, highly optimized AI data centers.\"SB Energy is backed by SoftBank and Ares Management. The company develops, owns and operates  energy projects across the U.S. It has offices in Redwood City, California, San Diego and Denver, according to its website. In addition to the investment, SB Energy has also formed a non-exclusive preferred partnership with OpenAI and SoftBank to develop \"a new model for data center builds,\" according to the release. That model will combine OpenAI's first-party data center design with SB Energy's \"proven expertise in speed, cost discipline, and integrated energy delivery,\" the companies said.The company has several multi-gigawatt data center campuses in development, and initial facilities are under construction and expected to enter service this year, the release said. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and OpenAI have become increasingly intertwined over the past year. Two months after the Stargate project was announced, OpenAI said it closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.SoftBank said in November that it's sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia for $5.83 billion as it looks to capitalize on its \"all in\" bet on OpenAI.The ChatGPT maker is burning through mounds of cash, and is still far from profitability, meaning it remains heavily reliant on outside capital.OpenAI has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. In November, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company was on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate in 2025, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.WATCH: Judge rules Elon Musk’s lawsuit over OpenAI for-profit conversion can head to trialwatch now",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

Conrades, 86, has been on the board for 18 years. Seligman, 87, joined the board in 2005.\"Neither retirement was the result of any dispute or disagreement with Oracle on any matter relating to Oracle's operations, policies or practices,\" the company said. Its board now consists of 12 directors. The software maker and cloud infrastructure provider has been under new management since September, when the company abruptly announced that it was replacing CEO Safra Catz, 64, with two executives, Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia. Magouyrk and Sicilia have been working to rapidly open data centers full of Nvidia graphics processing units that can run generative artificial intelligence models on behalf of clients such as OpenAI and xAI. Oracle shares surged in September after the company revealed a 359% jump in remaining performance obligation, suggesting that faster year-over-year revenue growth will follow. But the stock plummeted in the fourth quarter, more than erasing those earlier gains, as Wall Street became more skeptical of the company's ability to repay debts while delivering on AI. Larry Ellison, Oracle's 81-year-old co-founder and chief technology officer, remains on the company's board and continues to serve as executive chairman.

    "body": "Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Kermanshah, Iran on January 8, 2026. Kamran | Afp | Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader on Friday lashed out at anti-government protesters, saying they were \"vandals\" acting on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump by destroying public properties.In a broadcast on national television, reported by Reuters, Ali Khamenei warned Tehran would not tolerate \"mercenaries for foreigners.\"\"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,\" Khamenei said.  His comments came as the country of 92 million found itself largely cut off from the world on Friday, with authorities seeking to quell the sprawling protests by blacking out the internet.The demonstrations, which began in Tehran's bazaar on Dec. 28, have been fueled by growing frustrations over a long-running economic crisis, particularly the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices.The scale of the unrest makes it one of the most widespread demonstrations in recent years, according to Human Rights Activists News Agency, with dozens reported killed and nearly 2,300 arrested or detained. HRANA, a U.S.-registered nonprofit, relies on an activist network inside Iran for its reporting. Iranian leader Ali Khamenei comments on the recent protests against economic conditions on Iranian State Television in the capital Tehran on January 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe protests have also revived concerns about possible American intervention. Trump said last week that if Iran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Jan 2.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani reportedly responded at the time by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region.Iran, which is a member of OPEC, is a major player in the global oil market.Oil prices were last seen trading higher as energy market participants continued to monitor concerns over the disruption in Iran.

    "body": "An Imax private screening for the movie \"First Man\" at an AMC theater in New York on Oct. 10, 2018.Lars Niki | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThe theatrical industry is in flux — and one stock is rising above the rest.Imax saw its shares jump more than 44% in 2025, even before the company announced that it had generated a record $1.28 billion at the global box office for the year. Those ticket sales marked a more than 40% increase over 2024 and were 13% higher than its previous record set in 2019.Meanwhile, shares of fellow theatrical stocks AMC, Cinemark and Marcus Theatres cratered in 2025. AMC was down more than 60%, Cinemark's stock fell 25% and Marcus Corp., which operates theaters and hotel chains, slumped around 28%.The sharp declines on Wall Street come as theater operators struggle to grapple with massive changes in the industry.Domestic ticket sales have rebounded from the record lows posted during the Covid pandemic, but remain about 25% below the the record-breaking $11.8 billion collected in 2018. The 2025 box office fell short of the $9 billion analysts had projected heading into the year, signaling to industry watchdogs that post-pandemic hurdles could be more permanent than anticipated.\"In an environment where consumer spending headwinds and economic concerns forced consumers to be choiceful with their entertainment spending, streaming services continue to represent an attractive option,\" Eric Wold, executive director of equity research at Texas Capital Securities, told CNBC.At the same time that consumer habits have shifted toward the home entertainment market, Hollywood is producing fewer films. A combination of Wall Street penny-pinching, studio mergers and lingering production shutdowns from the pandemic and dual labor strikes has led to a significant drop-off in the number of movies hitting theaters. \"I think investors are still struggling with, and frankly, what everyone within the industry is still trying to figure out is, what is the real new normal for box office?\" said Robert Fishman, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson.The winnowing of theatrical has left Imax ahead of the pack. Move toward premiumWhen the theatrical slate is thin, Imax benefits, because when moviegoers do decide to leave their couches they are opting more and more for premium large format experiences.In 2025, more than 16% of tickets sold for domestic showtimes were for these types of theaters, according to data from EntTelligence. That's up from 15% in 2024 and 13.8% in 2023. Often called PLFs, premium large format auditoriums are considered an elevated viewing experience, with bigger screens and higher-quality sound systems and seating options — and they come with higher ticket prices. In 2025, general movie tickets averaged $13.29 apiece, while PLF tickets went for around $17.65 each, EntTelligence data showed. For comparison, premium tickets in 2024 averaged around $16.88 apiece. As Hollywood shifts toward producing more big-budget blockbuster features — while medium-to-low-budget films are more often sent to streaming — PLF screens will become increasingly important.After all, the films that benefit the most from PLF ticket sales have been Hollywood's biggest releases, as audiences want to see explosive action movies and dazzling spectacles in the most state-of-the-art locations. ScreenX is the world's first multi-projection cinema with an immersive 270 degree field of view.CJ 4DPLEXOn the docket for 2026 is Disney's \"Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" Universal and Christopher Nolan's \"The Odyssey,\" Netflix and Greta Gerwig's \"Narnia\" and Warner Bros. and Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Three.\" All of these films were shot with Imax film cameras and will have theatrical releases on Imax screens. The company has forecast its 2026 global box office haul at a new record of $1.4 billion. \"We see no signs of slowing down given a very promising slate ahead and the consistency of our market share gains, as filmmakers, studios, and audiences worldwide continue to gravitate toward the Imax experience,\" said Rich Gelfond, CEO of Imax, in a statement Wednesday.As of the end of September, Imax had more than 1,700 locations and a backlog of 478 contracts to build Imax screens. Notably, Imax screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.Putting up profitsAMC, Cinemark and Marcus all have premium large format movie screens as part of their suite of theaters as well and have invested in creating more of these spaces in their cinemas. But the chains are playing a game of catch-up. AMC, in addition to its existing partnership with Imax, has plans to add more Dolby Cinema theaters to its U.S.-based locations as well as Screen X and 4DX auditoriums globally. Cinemark, too, made investments in the last year to add more Screen X theaters to its portfolio.Of course, these upgrades can be expensive. In the case of AMC, renovations prior to the pandemic saddled the company with billions in debt, which was exacerbated during Covid-related shutdowns. The company is still dealing with this debt load.Working in Imax's favor is the fact that the company is notably asset-light, meaning it has minimized its ownership of physical assets like buildings by leveraging its technology and partnering with other companies. Instead of costly real estate leases, Imax makes deals with cinema chains to install its equipment into their auditoriums and then takes a share of the box office receipts for films screened in those theaters.AMC, Cinemark, Marcus and other theater operators, on the other hand, have the financial burden of rent and utility payments, which are only partially offset by ticket sales that they split with studios. Concessions — popcorn, soda and specialty food — have become the means for these businesses to drum up enough funds to cover expenses.But, if the production slate isn't strong and cinemas don't have enough content to draw in moviegoers, then profitability is at risk. In the first quarter of 2025, all three cinema stocks posted net losses. Marcus and Cinemark rebounded to profitability in the second and third quarter, as the calendar of films improved, while AMC posted two more periods in the red.Imax, on the other hand, was profitable in all three quarters. Through the first nine months of 2025, Imax reported net income of $43 million, up 67% from the same period in 2024. The theater stocks will all report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks as earnings reports roll out. ",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump met Friday afternoon with more than a dozen oil companies at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolás Maduro.Exxon CEO Darren Woods, ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance and Chevron Vice Chairman Mark Nelson attended. Executives from Halliburton, Valero and Marathon were also present among others. Trump said oil companies will spend at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. The U.S. will provide security and protection so \"they get their money back and make a very nice return,\" he said. The U.S. will decide which oil companies enter Venezuela, the president said. The White House will \"cut a deal with the companies\" Friday or shortly thereafter, he said.   \"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said.The White House called the meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground, so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine, to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen,\" Exxon's Woods said. Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters — our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "Close-up of a hand holding a cellphone displaying the Amazon Pharmacy system, Lafayette, California, Sept. 15, 2021.Smith Collection | Gado | Getty ImagesAmazon announced Friday it now offers Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight loss pill through its digital pharmacy.Novo Nordisk began rolling out an oral version of its injectable obesity drug Wegovy in the U.S. on Monday, offering a starting dose for cash-paying patients at $149 per month. Patients with insurance coverage can get the pill for as low as $25 a month. The daily pill enters the market with some of the lowest cash prices in the booming obesity and diabetes drug space, which costly weekly injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have long dominated. Its availability on Amazon underscores Novo Nordisk's strategy to expand beyond traditional channels and reach new patients.Amazon said eligible customers with insurance can pay as little as $25 for a one-month supply of the drug. Its cash-pay option will start at $149 a month. In the coming weeks, Amazon said it will also offer the Wegovy pill through its prescription vending kiosks, which are located in select One Medical clinics. The e-commerce giant launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 as part of its deeper push into the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry. The service was born out of its acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for roughly $750 million in 2018. It then bought primary-care clinic One Medical in 2022 for $3.9 billion. Amazon has sought to attract users to its service by offering speedy delivery and price transparency. It offers same-day prescription delivery to nearly half of U.S. consumers, Amazon said. The company hasn't disclosed how many users Amazon Pharmacy has, but analysts have estimated it could generate about $2 billion in annual revenue. In October, Weight Watchers said it would partner with Amazon Pharmacy to deliver weight loss medications for its members. Amazon Pharmacy has also collaborated with Eli Lilly to help deliver certain prescription medications, including its obesity drug Zepbound, purchased through the drugmaker's direct-to-consumer website.After its launch this week, the Novo Nordisk pill is also available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy.Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when.Health experts say oral options could expand obesity treatment access in the U.S., likely reaching entirely new people who were afraid of needles or believed injections were too serious or aggressive for them to start.Eli Lilly has a rival obesity pill that is slated to win Food and Drug Administration approval later this year.",

    "body": "watch nowIt's the week Sin City turned sci-fi. Humanoid robots shadowboxed, danced and pretended to run small shops. Singapore-based Sharpa displayed a robotic hand playing table tennis and dealing blackjack hands. Across Las Vegas, technology companies used the annual CES trade show to reveal their visions of the future and to loudly proclaim that physical artificial intelligence is poised for a breakout year. \"The humanoid industry is riding on the work of the AI factories we're building for other AI stuff,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at a news conference on Tuesday. Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang stands in front of a photo of several humanoid robots during his keynote at CES in Las Vegas on January 5, 2026.NvidiaNvidia, which last year became the world's most valuable company, announced a new version of its vision language models called Gr00t for humanoid robots that can turn sensor inputs into robot body control, as well as a version of its Cosmos model for robot reasoning and planning. Huang said he expects to see robots with some human-level capabilities this year.  \"I know how fast the technology is moving,\" he said. His company highlighted partnerships with the likes of Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar and LG.Science fiction writers have dreamed of this moment for decades. \"The Jetsons\" had Rosey, a robot maid. In \"Star Wars,\" C-3PO helped Luke Skywalker save the galaxy. However, in real life, humanoids have so far been unable to demonstrate the intelligence or flexibility that would make them truly useful, a problem that's long eluded engineers.Then came generative AI with the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022. The same deep learning technology that underpins ChatGPT can be used to teach the robots how to walk, use a hand or fold laundry. Many in the industry see self-driving cars as the first major commercial manifestation of physical AI. Industry heavyweights are going big. In addition to Nvidia, fellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm made splashy robot-related announcements at CES. On Monday, Google's DeepMind said it would work with Hyundai's Boston Dynamics, formerly a division of Google, to develop new AI models for its Atlas robot. The humanoid GENE.01 robot was showcased by AMD because it uses its chips and AI technology.Kif Leswing / CNBCMcKinsey estimates that the market for what it calls general-purpose robotics could reach $370 billion by 2040, with top use cases including \"warehouse logistics, light manufacturing, retail operations, agriculture, and healthcare.\" But some analysts were quick to point out that it's a long way from the show floor to the factory floor, or to the home. \"Although the humanoids were the ones that grabbed everyone's attention, and it was the best kind of eye candy for the show, we're still a very, very long way from the commercial implementation of these,\" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said in an interview. Building the brainAccording to CES' official exhibitor list, 40 companies at the event mentioned humanoid robots on the show's website. The Consumer Technology Association, which produces CES, hasn't said how many humanoid robot companies presented at this year's event, but CTA President Kinsey Fabrizio said the number of industrial and consumer robots at the show has been growing.AMD CEO Lisa Su on Monday revealed a new humanoid robot from Italy's Generative Bionics, a company that it's backing financially. The robot, Gene.01, is scheduled be deployed later this year in industrial environments like shipyards.LG's CLOiD robot made its debut this week, folding towels and loading the washing machine.Kif Leswing / CNBCGenerative Robotics is using AMD's cloud-based graphics processing units to train and fine-tune its models.\"This allows us to customize the next generation of the models on their GPUs,\" said Generative Robotics CEO Daniele Pucci. \"That is the brain.\"For now, robot chip sales are a small fraction of Nvidia's business, and AMD reports them as \"embedded\" sales, a term for industrial chips. Qualcomm's \"internet of things\" revenue was about 18% of the company's sales in the latest fiscal year. But they see an opportunity to win business from a new crop of robot makers by offering them not just chips, but an entire software ecosystem to make development easier.\"This is all about any of the major players establishing themselves as a one-stop shop for the robotics development community,\" Wood said. While the tech industry has become enamored with large language models in the generative AI boom, many robots are being enabled by vision language models. They can pair sensor data from a robot with traditional AI models to allow for reasoning or planning, such as a route through a messy floor of obstacles. LEM Surgical says its spine surgery robot is a \"humanoid.\"Kif Leswing / CNBCAlong with Nvidia's VLM announcements at CES, Qualcomm showed off a new line of robot chips called Dragonwing that can use the company's VLMs. Qualcomm is using tele-operations to teach its VLM specific skills like how to use actuators to grasp an object.One particular area of excitement for Nvidia is medicine. The company showcased a robot from a company called LEM Surgical using its Thor chip. The robot was described as a humanoid, but it didn't have legs. Rather, it had three arms, two for using tools and one that controlled a face-like module of cameras and sensors. Its sole function is to help doctors with spine surgery.Down the exhibit hall, Nvidia demonstrated a Chinese humanoid robot called Agibot that used a large language model to chat with attendees, though it had trouble standing on the conference center's plush carpets. What robots can do right nowCalifornia-based 1X became the first to launch a multi-modal home helper robot in October 2025 with its $20,000 \"Neo\" humanoid.1XAlso at the show, Korea's LG showed off its wheeled humanoid CLOiD robot for the first time. In the demonstration, CLOiD, which is designed for the home, promised to make breakfast and took a wet towel from the presenter and stuck it in a washing machine. But it was slow. Folding a rectangular towel that was laid out by a presenter took CLOiD about 30 seconds. Speed isn't the only concern. Experts are also worried about safety and the damage that could be caused by consumer robots. \"Home is very unstructured,\" said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation. \"You can't plan for a child running into the robot or the robot running over a pet.\" China-based UniTree's G1 humanoid Koid sells for around $70,000 in the U.S.UniTreeSome of the first humanoid robots on the market could be more about fun and flash than productivity. China's Unitree Robotics displayed its $70,000 G1 robot at CES. Large crowds of onlookers were treated to a performance of boxing and dancing on the show floor. The largest tech companies in the world are betting that the market is rapidly evolving. Nvidia's Huang said this week that robots are having their \"ChatGPT moment.\"Modar Alaoui, general partner at ALM Ventures, sees robots rapidly moving from novelty to reality. \"The next generation is just going to grow up with these machines whether we accept it or not,\" he said. — CNBC's Katie Tarasov contributed to this story.

    "body": "watch nowVenture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has raised $15 billion to bolster bets across an array of areas including infrastructure, health and what the it calls \"American Dynamism,\" co-founder Ben Horowitz said in a blog post on Friday. The bulk of the capital, $6.75 billion, will go toward a growth fund and two $1.7 billion funds, with one focused on apps and the other on infrastructure. \"At this moment of profound technological opportunity, it is fundamentally important for humanity that America wins,\" Horowitz wrote. \"There is no other country that comes close to giving everyone a chance to grab that opportunity and build. If America fails to win technologically, it will lose economically, militarily, geopolitically, and culturally. And the entire world will lose as well.\"Andreessen Horowitz is dedicating $3 billion to support other venture strategies and about $1.2 billion to fund American interests such as aerospace and defense, the post said. Some $700 million is going toward biotech and health investments. The raise is equal to 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the U.S. last year, Horowitz said. It's more than doubled the amount the firm raised in 2024. Since its founding in 2009, Andreessen Horowitz has risen to become one of the most prominent venture capital firms, known for early investments in Facebook, Coinbase and Airbnb.In recent years, the Silicon Valley-based firm has been betting big on defense tech, with investments in Palmer Luckey's Anduril, Elon Musk's SpaceX and machine parts maker Hadrian.The sector has benefitted from President Donald Trump's ambitious plans to reindustrialize America's military and manufacturing base. This week, the president also called for a $1.5 trillion defense budget next year. Both Horowitz and co-founder Marc Andreessen supported President Trump in the 2024 election, though Horowitz later said he would be donating to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party (GOP) member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2026. Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he has canceled a fresh military attack on Venezuela, saying the two countries \"are working well together,\" on rebuilding the nation's oil and gas infrastructure.Writing on Truth Social on Friday, Trump noted Venezuela's release of \"large numbers of political prisoners\" which he called \"a very important and smart gesture.\"\"Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed, however, all ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes,\" Trump said.In a press conference on Jan. 3, Trump had suggested it was unlikely a second attack on Venezuela would be deemed necessary due to what he called the success of the first operation. \"We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so,\" he told reporters at the time. \"So we were prepared to do a second wave if we needed to do so. We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary. But now it's probably not — the first wave, if you'd like to call it, the first attack was so successful, we probably don't have to do a second but we're prepared to do a second wave, a much bigger wave.\"Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela over the weekend that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, both of whom were indicted on drug trafficking charges. The pair pleaded not guilty. Maduro claimed he'd been \"kidnapped\" and was a \"prisoner of war\" at a court appearance in New York this week. On Thursday, Jorge Rodríguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, announced that the government would release a significant number of foreign and Venezuelan prisoners. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares later said five Spanish prisoners had been released and were on a flight back to their home country. Since Maduro's ousting, Trump has turned his attention to oil-rich Venezuela's energy resources, saying shortly after the operation took place that he had been in talks with oil giants about rebuilding the country's oil infrastructure. In his post on Friday, Trump said at least $100 billion will be invested in Venezuela by \"Big Oil,\" noting that he would meet with representatives for U.S. oil giants at the White House later on Friday. Chevron is currently the only oil major operating in Venezuela, and U.S. oil majors have so far been largely silent on Trump's push for their participation in rebuilding the country's energy systems. Venezuela, a founding member of the powerful OPEC energy alliance, sits on 303 billion barrels of crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That represents around 17% of the world's oil reserves — but it's currently thought to produce less than 1% of global oil output, and exports only half of what it makes.On Tuesday, Trump said Venezuelan authorities would give the U.S. up to 50 million barrels of oil, which will be sold at market prices. \"That money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" Trump said at the time. Sources close to the White House later told CNBC that Venezuela will ship sanctioned oil to the U.S. indefinitely. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this article. ",

    "body": "An Amazon warehouse in Warrington, England.Nathan Stirk | Getty ImagesAmazon has submitted plans for a large-format store near Chicago that would be larger than a Walmart Supercenter, marking the latest experiment with physical retail for the tech company.As part of the plans, Amazon has proposed building a one-story, 229,000-square-foot building in Orland Park, Illinois, that would offer a range of products, such as groceries, household essentials and general merchandise, the city said on Saturday. By comparison, Walmart's U.S. Supercenters typically average 179,000 square feet.The Amazon facility would also include a \"limited warehouse component\" to support on-site operations and space for delivery drivers to pick up orders, according to planning documents.\"We regularly test new experiences designed to make customers' lives better and easier every day, including physical stores,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"The site in question is our planned location for a new concept that we think customers will be excited about.\"The e-commerce company has been determined to have a bigger presence in brick-and-mortar retail after stealing market share from incumbents. Amazon acquired upscale grocer Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion in 2017, the largest deal in its history.Amazon also launched bookstores, shopping mall kiosks, apparel stores, convenience marts and its own supermarket chain. It's since scrapped many of those concepts or slowed the rollout of new locations. The Orland Park Plan Commission approved Amazon's proposal on Tuesday, and it will now proceed to a vote from the full village board. That meeting is scheduled for Jan. 19. The proposed facility would replace a local restaurant, Petey's II, which closed in January 2024. The site sits at the corner of two major highways running through Orland Park, and would be down the street from a Target, Costco and Trader Joe's, among other major national chains. Some residents have pushed back on Amazon's planned development, expressing concerns over how it could impact traffic in the surrounding area, NBC 5 Chicago reported.WATCH: How AI could upend shoppingwatch now",

    "body": "The Camp Jeep outdoor terrain at the New York International Auto Shown on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Stellantis is scrapping its plug-in hybrid electric Jeep SUVs and Chrysler minivan amid slowing EV sales, quality issues and weakened federal fuel economy requirements. The automaker on Friday said the decision to end production of the plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica was a result of waning customer demand and the need to focus on \"more competitive electrified solutions, including hybrid and range‑extended vehicles.\"\"Stellantis continually evaluates its product strategy to meet evolving customer needs and regulatory requirements. With customer demand shifting, Stellantis will phase out plug‑in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year,\" the company said in an emailed statement.The decision is an about-face for the automaker, which has touted its U.S. sales leadership of the models for years. In 2024, then-Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa — who is now CEO of Stellantis — said the SUV brand planned to sell 160,000 to 170,000 PHEVs that year, and the company said it represented 41% of U.S. PHEV sales.watch nowAside from sales, Stellantis has been using PHEVs as a way to offset its production of gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs to attempt to meet federal fuel economy standards and avoid penalties. The goal has become less urgent as the Trump administration eliminates or weakens aspects of those rules. Chrysler first introduced its PHEV minivan in 2016. Jeep debuted the Wrangler PHEV, which it called a \"4xe,\" in 2020, followed by a Grand Cherokee version in 2021.PHEVs feature traditional internal combustion engines, but also have an all-electric range when charged like an EV. They have largely been viewed as a transitional technology from traditional vehicles to EVs; however, they are quite costly because of their two different propulsion systems. The cancellation also comes amid a recall of the Jeep SUVs due to fire risk — the latest in a string of issues for the vehicles. The company is also reevaluating its product portfolio as part of its U.S. turnaround strategy.A 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee.JeepThe company said the recall, which included a stop-sale of the vehicles, \"is in no way related\" to the cancellation of the vehicles. Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf late last month told CNBC the brand was evaluating its electrification strategy since the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives for EVs and PHEVs in September.He said Jeep still had vehicles on the ground that it would continue to sell, but \"all of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out, and what becomes steady state for 4xe and [battery] EVs in general.\"A Jeep spokeswoman said the brand will continue to offer all-electric SUVs such as the Wagoneer S and Recon, which was officially revealed late last year.",

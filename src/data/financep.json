    "body": "Colleen McCarthy was working a corporate job she was never \"super excited about\" when she started creating floral arrangements in her free time.Two years later, she's designed floral arrangements for stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Drew Barrymore through her business Colleen Rose Florals.McCarthy, 27, grew up in Ridgefield, CT. She majored in environmental studies and communications at Fordham University, but after she graduated in 2020, \"it was hard to find a job, period, let alone a job that I really wanted to do,\" she says.She landed a job at a PR agency, but viewed the job as a \"temporary thing\" while she figured out her long-term plan.A couple years into her job, McCarthy says she had a \"mini quarter-life crisis\" about her career. She took a step back to reflect: \"What do I like? What have I always liked? What am I good at?\"McCarthy has always loved flowers — \"I would always be the person in my apartment who would buy flowers from the grocery store and arrange them nicely,\" she says — so when she came across floral design as a potential creative career, she decided to give it a try.In late 2022, McCarthy took an introductory class at Flower School New York, a floral design education institution. Beginner classes currently cost about $175, per their website.\"I remember the instructor came over to me, and she was like, 'Oh, is this your first class?' And I said, yeah. And she was like, 'It doesn't seem like it. You seem to have a natural talent for this,'\" she recalls. Hearing that gave her McCarthy the confidence to seriously pursue floral design, she says. 'I just started telling people I was a florist'While still working her full-time job, McCarthy started buying grocery store flowers each week to practice making her floral designs, and she began sharing her work on Instagram and TikTok and in several local Facebook groups.Social media was \"really huge\" in helping McCarthy grow her business, she says. \"I just started telling people I was a florist, even though I wasn't really that established,\" she says. \"I think just telling myself and telling other people, like, 'Yeah, I'm a florist,' it made it happen more easily.\"McCarthy holding one of her floral designs.Jenna Yandle PhotographyHer first official sale was to a member of one of the Facebook groups in March 2023.\"I was just so excited, just the fact that someone would pay for my work,\" she says. \"That was also really validating.\"In May 2023, McCarthy officially registered Colleen Rose Florals as an LLC – a costly process, she says, but ultimately worth it.\"I don't regret it at all, because then I had all the official stuff done, and then when I really started getting more traction and getting more business, I was happy that I had that,\" she says.McCarthy started working with event planners to design florals for brand events, and even booked her first wedding at the end of 2023.\"After I did that, it also gave me so much more confidence that I could do larger-scale events and figure it out,\" she recalls.Focusing on floralsHalfway through 2024, McCarthy says she started to \"really consider\" quitting her day job.\"There were more and more instances where I was having to turn down flower jobs because of my nine to five,\" she says. \"That was kind of a tipping point, I think, because I was like, 'Wait a second, I would like to be saying yes to these opportunities.'\" In December 2024, McCarthy decided to leave her job to focus on running Colleen Rose Florals.\"I kind of was pretty confident that I would be successful,\" she says. \"I didn't really feel nervous or scared about it. I think maybe my mom was a little more nervous than I was.\"In 2025, the first year she focused on the business full-time, Colleen Rose Florals brought in over $175,000.An arrangement McCarthy designed for a brand event.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyHer main business expense, naturally, is flowers. High-quality blooms are \"really expensive,\" she says, and \"there's a disconnect between what the average consumer thinks flowers cost, and what flowers actually cost.\"McCarthy provides floral arrangements for a variety of occasions, including weddings, brand events, book launches, photoshoots and even concerts.She charges a minimum of $250 for a single \"bespoke\" floral arrangement and typically charges $1,000 or above for smaller events, while small-to-medium weddings can cost between $5,000 and $10,000.Starting in the spring of 2024, Madison Square Garden began commissioning floral arrangements from McCarthy to decorate artists' dressing rooms. This year, she's provided bouquets for the dressing rooms of stars like Katy Perry, Lainey Wilson, Haim and Renee Rapp.One of her most exciting moments was being asked to create a bouquet for Sabrina Carpenter in October.\"That was so exciting and validating, that someone felt confident enough in me to order my work for a huge artist,\" she recalls.A floral arrangement that McCarthy designed for Sabrina Carpenter's dressing room at Madison Square Garden.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyLooking aheadRight now, Colleen Rose Florals is a solo operation, though McCarthy sometimes hires freelancers to help out with large events.Every day running her floral business is \"super different,\" she says, but she usually wakes up at 6 a.m. to buy flowers from Manhattan's flower district.She typically starts preparing for major events the day before, she says, and depending on the scale of the event, she either takes the flowers back to her apartment, or rents a studio space for the day. McCarthy has to \"process\" each flower – a \"pretty time-consuming\" task of taking off the leaves, cutting the stem, peeling off any old petals, and putting it in water – before she can start working on her arrangements.Once she's finished with her designs, she transports them to the venue by hiring a driver or renting a van herself.A bouquet McCarthy designed for an engagement party.Courtesy of Colleen McCarthyAs a solo business owner, one of the biggest lessons she's learned has been \"knowing when to ask for help,\" she says. \"There have been a couple times where I pulled an all-nighter to finish everything, or I made all these arrangements by myself, when it would have taken half the time if I just asked for help,\" she says.McCarthy's main business goals for 2026 are to rent a permanent studio space and to launch a weekly floral arrangement subscription program as a way to create \"another consistent stream of income.\"She still posts her floral designs on social media, and often receives messages from aspiring florists hoping to learn about her career journey.\"That used to be me, reaching out to florists, wanting to learn from them,\" McCarthy says. \"The fact that I am now someone that others are inspired by is really crazy.\"\"It makes me feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing,\" she continues.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "The housing market has spent the past few years stuck with high prices and slow sales. But in 2026, conditions are expected to ease slightly for buyers, a shift Redfin describes as a \"reset\" year.That reset is being driven by a growing supply of homes after years of limited inventory, which may push prices down in some markets next year. Overall, home prices have mostly leveled off over the past two years, as new construction has picked up. And there are already signs the market is loosening: Homes are sitting on the market longer, negotiations are becoming more common, and builders are offering discounts in markets where the supply of newly constructed homes has increased, according to Realtor.com.That doesn't mean homes will suddenly become affordable nationwide. Median home prices are still too high for many buyers after rising by 25% since 2020, according to U.S. Census data. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are also expected to remain elevated above 6% in 2026, limiting how much relief buyers are likely to see.In some markets, though, builders are increasingly using price cuts and incentives to move inventory, giving buyers more leverage, even though affordability remains tight overall.\"The bottom line for 2026 is that it will be a transitional year,\" Chris Reis, a broker with Compass in Seattle, tells CNBC Make It. \"There won't be a crash or a boom, just the market finding its footing after years of extraordinary disruption. Buyers will have more selection and negotiating power than at any time since the pandemic.\"What to expect in 2026Most housing forecasts point to a market that looks more stable than dramatic: Home prices are expected to rise slowly, and mortgage rates might dip modestly, although borrowing costs will still make buying expensive for many households. Here's how several major forecasters expect U.S. home prices to change in 2026:Redfin: +1.0%Realtor.com: +2.2%Zillow: +1.2%Fannie Mae: +1.3%Meanwhile, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% in 2026, where they've been for the past three years. The current average rate is about 6.2%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Here's where major forecasters expect rates to land next year:Redfin: 6.3%Realtor.com: 6.3%Fannie Mae: 5.9%Mortgage Bankers Association: Low-to-mid 6% range While there may not be a lot of cost relief in home prices or mortgage rates, buyers are seeing more negotiating room where housing supply has increased — particularly in new construction.That's because builders sitting on recently completed homes are more willing to make deals, says Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.\"Quick move-in inventory is readily available, and builders are cutting prices and offering incentives to get it sold,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. That flexibility is less common in the current housing market, where many homeowners remain locked into lower mortgage rates and have little incentive to sell.Where prices could decline in 2026Home-price trends in 2026 are expected to vary widely by metropolitan area.While prices will keep rising modestly in many parts of the country, some large housing markets are expected to see flat or declining prices, particularly across parts of the West and South, per Realtor.com. In those areas, buyers may find more room to negotiate.Based on Realtor.com's 2026 forecast, these are 10 of the 100 largest U.S. metros expected to see the biggest year-over-year home-price declines next year:Cape Coral–Fort Myers, Florida: −10.2% North Port–Sarasota–Bradenton, Florida: −8.9% Stockton–Lodi, California: −4.1% Raleigh, North Carolina: −3.7% Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida: −3.6% Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, Florida: −3.6% Spokane–Spokane Valley, Washington: −3.5% Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, Colorado: −3.4% Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, California: −3.3% San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, California: −2.5%Realtor.com's projections estimate 2026 home-price changes by factoring in inventory, mortgage-rate expectations, and local economic conditions.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The composite PMI, a broader measure that tracks activity across manufacturing and services, climbed to 50.7 from 49.7 in November, pointing to broader improvement across the economy.China's non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, increased to 50.2 from 49.5 in November.Huo Lihui, chief statistician from China's National Bureau of Statistics, said that new orders rose in December, signaling a \"significant expansion\" in both production and demand in manufacturing.Private-sector data showed a similar trend. A separate PMI from independent research firm RatingDog showed manufacturing activity rising to 50.1 from 49.9, beating expectations of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog, said the reading indicated the manufacturing sector had returned to expansion. He noted that total new orders grew for a seventh consecutive month, supported by domestic new product launches and business development, leading to growth in production.However, Yao said that while firms remain confident for 2026, optimism has eased and remained below the historical average.Large enterprises drove the improvement, with their PMI rising to 50.8, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Activity among smaller firms remained weaker. The PMI for medium-sized enterprises rose to 49.8, while the index for small enterprises fell to 48.6, down 0.5 percentage points from November.Markets were mixed after the release. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.83%, while the mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.33%. The data followed a decision by China's central bank earlier this week to keep loan prime rates unchanged, despite weak economic data and an extended slump in the property sector plaguing the world's second-largest economy.November's retail sales and industrial output missed expectations, while investment in fixed assets also contracted. Hao Zhou, chief economist at securities company Guotai Junan International, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday that the reading was a \"very good, positive surprise to the market.\"\"Maybe the market is concerned about China's property market, China stock market, as well as the consumption,\" Zhou said. \"The data for now suggests that the economy is on the right trend, and the momentum remains solid.\"",

    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersChina has urged the Netherlands to swiftly correct its \"mistakes\" over chipmaker Nexperia and restore stability in the global semiconductor industry, in the latest development in a dispute over technology transfer.In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker based in the Netherlands. The unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns.In response, China moved to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components.On Wednesday, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry said that the Netherlands should \"immediately correct its mistakes and clear the obstacles to restoring the stability and security of the global semiconductor supply chain.\"\"What is perplexing is that, faced with the anxiety and unease of the global industry, the Netherlands remains indifferent and stubbornly insists on its own way, showing absolutely no responsible attitude towards the security of the global semiconductor supply chain, and taking no substantive action whatsoever,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, according to a Google translation.A spokesperson for the Dutch government was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Wednesday morning. Dutch Economy Minister Vincent Karremans has repeatedly defended his decision to intervene in the company over recent weeks. Read moreNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The low-tech, inexpensive chips are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, they're used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows.Auto industry groups have said that disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts have not yet been fundamentally resolved, meaning that component availability remains uncertain.Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. Speaking to CNBC last month, a spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Burry recently made headlines with a tech short bet. He said some of America's largest companies were using aggressive accounting to inflate their supposed profits from the artificial intelligence boom.Burry's latest comments on Tesla come shortly after the company took the unusual step of publishing delivery estimates that appear to indicate a lower-than-expected outlook.Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.Read moreTesla on Monday compiled an average estimate for 1.6 million vehicle deliveries in 2025, down roughly 8% from 2024 and putting the company on track for its second straight annual drop.Tesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company, whose stock recently notched an all-time closing high of $489.88, saw shares collapse in the first quarter amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric. Shares of Tesla were up slightly in afternoon trading Wednesday.

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.The company also said it will take steps to wind down Manus AI's remaining business operations in China and that \"there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests\" after the transaction.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

(Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE / AFP) (Photo by ARNAUD FINISTRE/AFP via Getty Images)          Arnaud Finistre | Afp | Getty ImagesIt'll come as no surprise that sales of Champagne peak in the run-up to Christmas and New Year, with French fizz the drink of choice for many households in the festive season.Every year, around 120,000 seasonal workers come to work in France, harvesting grapes across 34,000 hectares of vines. The harvest only lasts a couple of weeks, making it a frenetic time for the sector.A darker side to the industry has emerged when it comes to that work, however, with recent reports shining a light on the exploitation and mistreatment of champagne grape pickers who are often foreign and undocumented migrants.During an extreme heatwave in the late summer of 2023, at least four migrant grape pickers, or \"vendangeurs\" as they're known, died in what has since been dubbed the \"harvest of shame.\"The case highlighted broader substandard working and housing conditions for pickers, including excessive working hours, low pay, a lack of safety equipment and protocols, such as adequate hydration and breaks.The scandal around working conditions and welfare comes at a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season, just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Nonetheless, this year's sales, which will be released in January, are likely to be further dented by U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU, which caused Champagne shipments to the U.S. to slump.'Blatant mistreatment'The murkier side of the Champagne industry came to light when at least four migrant grape pickers died during the 2023 harvest, which took place during an extreme heatwave. Seasonal workers harvest grapes in vineyards in the AOC (Appellation d'origine contrôlée) Champagne region on September 14, 2023 in Châtillon-sur-Marne, France. Thierry Monasse | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThen, in the summer of 2025, three individuals were put on trial, accused of human trafficking and exploiting over 50 West African migrant workers during the 2023 harvest.The victims reported being treated \"like slaves\" and \"animals\" and being housed in \"hellish\" and unsanitary conditions with no clean drinking water. Such conditions compromised workers' safety, health and dignity, the labor inspectorate said in the case. Unscrupulous hiring practices were also thrust into the spotlight during the trial as the defendants were affiliated with an employment agency which provided workers to the industry, highlighting Champagne houses' widespread use of subcontractors and employment agencies, or more informal channels, to recruit grape pickers. The defendants were convicted and handed fines and prison sentences, while trade unions said the use of \"middlemen\" and agencies had enabled Champagne houses to turn a blind eye to illegal working practices.In a summary of the case which was held in Châlons-en-Champagne criminal court, the prosecutor commented, \"we cannot accept that behind a bottle of Champagne lies uncontrolled subcontracting and blatant mistreatment.\"Sales challengesThe Comité Champagne — the overarching trade body for France's Champagne industry and representing over 16,000 winegrowers, 130 cooperatives and 370 Champagne houses — acknowledged that the court case had damaged the industry's reputation and said it would take a \"zero tolerance\" approach to any future abuses.\"We had to stand with the victims. You don't play games with the health and safety of seasonal workers. Nor do you play games with the image of our appellation,\" Comité co-presidents David Chatillon and Maxime Toubart told Le Monde newspaper in July after the trial. The Comité launched a \"Together for the Champagne Harvest\" action plan to ensure that worker health and safety protocols and worker accommodations were improved, as well as harvest regulations.  A French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) union member hands out pamphlets to seasonal grape pickers, often foreign workers, in a Champagne vineyard to inform them of their labour rights, in Igny-Comblizy, eastern France, on September 19, 2024. Francois Nascimbeni | Afp | Getty ImagesChampagne winegrowers and houses have been keen to show they are committed to workers' well-being. Moët & Chandon, the world's largest producer and part of LVMH, invested 1.5 million euros ($1.76 million) in new accommodation for an extra 90 grape pickers in 2024, bringing the total capacity of its accommodation provision to up to 1,900 beds. CNBC asked the Comité Champagne whether welfare measures had been fully implemented by its member organizations since they were proposed, but has not yet received a response. CNBC also contacted several unions, including the CGT labor union and SGV union of Champagne growers, about the reforms, but did not receive responses. watch nowIt's no doubt a difficult time for the wider industry — 2024's harvest saw lower yields than average due to spring frosts and a rainy period during the summer that only subsided toward the end of the growing season — just about \"saving\" the harvest. The 2025 harvest fared better and was lauded for its high-quality vintage, thanks to clement weather conditions.Synonymous with north-eastern France, Champagne accounts for 10% of the world's sparkling wine production by volume, but as much as 35% of sparkling wine's global market value.However, sales have declined in recent years amid a fall in global demand and declining alcohol consumption.In 2023, shipments of Champagne (which are typically a mix of several years' harvests) totalled 299 million bottles, down 8.2% compared to the previous year. In 2024, 271 million bottles were shipped, according to the Comité Champagne data. This year's sales face additional headwinds from U.S. import tariffs on goods from the EU.The industry has also faced challenges from within, with the CGT labor union at LVMH's Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot's champagne units calling on workers to strike in December over the cancellation of year-end bonuses and demands for better pay. A spokesman for Moët & Chandon told CNBC that it would not comment on the dispute but that negotiations over pay would take place in early 2026, noting, \"we cannot comment before the negotiations.\" If sales keep falling, the treatment of seasonal pickers will be just one challenge facing the industry.",

    "body": "watch nowAt a challenging time for the restaurant industry, major chains like Chipotle and Cava are putting money behind automated makelines from startup Hyphen.The San Jose, California-based company aims to help restaurants achieve two key goals in a hyper-competitive environment: speedy throughput and good customer service. The technology makes for a less chaotic and more \"elegant experience\" for workers and guests alike, co-founder and CEO Stephen Klein told CNBC in an interview. \"We're probably making a bowl every 10 to 15 seconds. At peak throughput, we have more capacity usually than they do demand, especially ... for lunch and dinner rushes,\" Klein said.That efficiency has brought increased interest across the industry. In August 2025, Hyphen closed a Series B round of financing that included up to $10 million from Cava. Chipotle said it has invested a total of $25 million into Hyphen via its Cultivate Next venture fund through the third quarter of 2025. The $25 million Series B round will help Hyphen scale its production and rollout across restaurants in the U.S. Its production will ramp with Re:Build Manufacturing, a company based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Chipotle's Hyphen makeline is in San Jose for modification after an in-restaurant test. Cava will test and pilot its tech for a second makeline to serve digital and takeout orders in the back of its kitchen in the future.A finished burrito bowl assembled by Chipotle and Hyphen's automation technology.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillHyphen's technology solves for both a speed and labor issue, helping to automate part of the service process that can be repetitive and challenging to fill. \"You can have, somebody is selling ingredients on top, while the rest of this stuff is happening underneath,\" he said of the makeline, which relies on a series of robotic hands to prep salads and bowls under a long table, out of public view, sending them down the row.The makelines cost between $50,000 and $100,000 to purchase, and restaurant customers are often getting a return on investment in under a year, Klein said. They operate 95% of the time, but during the rare moments they're down, workers can jump in to complete orders, the way an escalator would turn into stairs, he said.Another key feature is cutting down on food waste. The technology tracks ingredients \"down to the gram,\" Klein said.\"We're perfectly portioning every ingredient, we're able to help them save on food costs, or at least reduce food costs in some way,\" he said. The idea of the company began when Klein and his co-founder Daniel Fukuba built a fully robotic food truck, which launched in Los Angeles three months before the pandemic started. They changed gears to launch Hyphen soon after that.\"When the pandemic happened, we kind of just had to share that into another direction. We had luckily been talking to other restaurant partners about licensing our technology for them, and we decided ... it just made a lot more sense to help restaurants that are already around today,\" Klein said.Technology innovation will likely continue to be a key trend in the restaurant sector after a brutal year for many of the industry's leaders. Shares of Cava and Chipotle are down nearly 50% and 40% year-to-date, respectively, after pullbacks from key demographics including younger consumers. Sweetgreen, another competitor in the healthy salad and bowl space, is down nearly 80% on the year. Sweetgreen sold its robotics unit, Spyce, to mealtime platform Wonder earlier this year for $186.4 million. Sweetgreen had acquired Spyce to build its automated Infinite Kitchens, and it will continue to use the technology.Klein said Hyphen is talking to major brands and food service providers for college campuses and office parks as it looks to not only evolve the makeline, but also provide data that comes from the food prep and distribution. The company aims to develop more software in the future, including tools for food prep scheduling to be used in the back of the house. One area that's not on the menu, at least for now, is the fast food sector.\"We're really trying to help people that have really a high mix or high customization in terms of what their guests are ordering, as well as high volume. So that's kind of our strike zone,\" he said. watch now",

    "body": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019, as officials debated the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting — 12 vote on rates — indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half-percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes. ARC, which is owned by private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners, operated 77 Hardee's restaurants before the legal battle began. Its footprint stretched across eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming, according to legal filings.Papa John'sThe Papa John's Pizza logo is shown in Austin, Texas, May 9, 2024.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesIn the first three quarters of 2025, Papa John's shuttered 173 restaurants worldwide, according to company filings. Most of the closures affected international locations, although 62 of the pizza chain's U.S. locations also closed.Despite the closures, Papa John's still had nearly 6,000 restaurants in operation at the end of September.Noodles & Co.Michael Siluk | UCG | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt the end of October, Noodles & Co. had closed 29 company-owned restaurants this year, and executives said that they planned to shutter another two to five underperforming locations by the end of 2025. In 2024, the fast-casual chain closed 20 locations.By the end of 2026, Noodles & Co. is planning to close another 12 to 17 stores, as it aims to improve the company's financial performance and boost sales at the chain's nearby locations.Outback SteakhouseAn Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Daly City, California, Jan. 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn October, restaurant company Bloomin' Brands closed 21 locations across the company. The closures hit Outback Steakhouse, the gem of its portfolio, as well as Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's Italian Grill.Bloomin' has identified nearly two dozen other restaurants that will not renew their leases when they expire over the next four years, executives said in November when sharing the company's quarterly earnings. At the same time, the company announced a $75 million turnaround plan to improve Bloomin' sales and its overall financial health.",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein during a party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported.About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The review of the staggering number of files will take until at least Jan. 20 to complete, the Times reported. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23.The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender.While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted \"an exhaustive review\" of its files on Epstein.Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers \"are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.\"\"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche wrote, adding, \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.\"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19.The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the \"next couple weeks.\"\"I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said at the time.On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been \"uncovered\" and that it would take \"a few more weeks\" to release them.The document cited by Reuters on Wednesday said that the 400 additional lawyers are being provided by the DOJ's Criminal Division and National Security Division, as well as the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.Newly-released documents from disgraced late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including a sheaf of entirely redacted pages, are seen in handouts released by the Justice Department and printed and arranged for a photograph by Reuters in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe FBI declined to comment. The other divisions and the Manhattan office did not immediately respond to CNBC's outreach.Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time-off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said.After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated.The department said it \"is not redacting the names of any politicians\" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a \"cover-up to protect Donald Trump,\" a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification",

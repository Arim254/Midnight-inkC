    "body": "Mornings are one of the most underestimated aspects of a relationship. For many working couples, they're something to rush through on the way to the day ahead. Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days.But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. Here's what they do differently that most neglect.1. They resist the urge to rush past each otherYour partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode.That often means making eye contact when saying \"good morning\" or sharing coffee or tea together without distractions. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small \"bids\" for attention that signal recognition and care.Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun.2. They sync before they speakMornings aren't ideal for heavy conversations. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more.The happiest couples understand this intuitively. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines.Even a few moments of silent togetherness can regulate the nervous system and make the day feel more manageable.3. They exchange one honest sentence about how they're feelingRather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings:\"I'm feeling a bit anxious about today.\"\"I'm excited but exhausted.\"\"I'm not fully awake yet.\"They're not revolutionary, but they're necessary for giving context to moods and behavior the other will see later on. It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day.4. They keep one small morning ritual sacredThis could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. The point is for it to be simple enough for you to repeat daily without struggle.Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call \"our thing\" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple.5. They use touch to regulate, not just to say goodbyeIn many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. They use touch intentionally to ground themselves.Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate.6. They treat mornings as a shared system, not a solo sprintMornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load.Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill.7. They send each other into the day feeling supportedBefore parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support:\"Good luck with your presentation today.\"\"You've got this.\"\"Text me if you need a pep talk.\"While they won't change the day's demands, they can make the demands feel easier to manage. More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from members of the media during a meeting with oil and gas executives in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 9, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that aims to block the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.The executive order states that the revenue, which is held in foreign government deposit funds, are \"held solely for sovereign purposes\" and that any court attempt to seize the funds will \"materially harm the national security and foreign policy\" of the U.S. The order, which declared a national emergency, said the funds are the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic means, and are not assets subject to private claims. Any use of judicial process against the funds will interfere with efforts to \"ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the order says.Trump signed the order nearly one week after U.S. military forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas. Both were indicted on drug-trafficking charges and have pleaded not guilty. Since the military operation, Trump has said that both nations \"are working well together\" on rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure and that American oil giants will invest at least $100 billion in the South American country.Trump met with major oil industry executives on Friday afternoon in an effort to get U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. In that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that right now Venezuela is \"uninvestable.\"ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil exited Venezuela after its government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized the country's oil sector along with several other key industries. Both companies have filed arbitration cases against Venezuela seeking billions of dollars in compensation for assets that were expropriated by the government.Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Trump administration.In his Friday order, Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as legal justification for safeguarding Venezuelan oil revenue in U.S. accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",

Trump aides are set to brief the president Tuesday on measures, including military, cyber and economic, to follow through on his threats, according to reports.  Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran in recent days, warning its leaders against using force against protestors. On Saturday, the president said the U.S. is \"ready to help.\"The discussion of possible intervention comes as Iran's clerical leadership is facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022. More than 500 people have been killed amid a third week of protests and an ongoing economic crisis, according to human rights agencies. Iran's government has intensified its crackdown on protestors, including a reported internet blackout.Iran has been an Islamic Republic since 1979, after the U.S.-backed Shah was deposed by Ayatollah Khomenei. His protégé, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also known as the Supreme Leader, is now in charge. With an inflation rate above 50%, Iran — a country of 92 million people — has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseTrump earlier this week threatened military intervention if Iran moves to crush the protests. Tehran warned on Sunday that it would retaliate against Israeli and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran. Some U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed skepticism about the prospect of the U.S. intervening with Iran.\"I don't think it's the job of the American government to be involved with every freedom movement around the world,\" Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week.\" Paul argued that bombing Iran risks rallying its citizens to the government's side. Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that history shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, arguing the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government triggered a series of events that eventually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the 1970s.The White House and U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.This story is developing.

    "body": "Around 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026, new LinkedIn research finds. Filadendron | E+ | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a \"critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,\" as it speeds up processes. \"Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,\" she said. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. \"We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,\" Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. \"The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.\"Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,\" Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. Chamberlin says AI is a \"big part of the solution,\" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. Avoid sending generic applications The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to \"be targeted\" when crafting your resume and cover letter. \"Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,\" she said. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.\"In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,\" she said. \"If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.\"Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the federal government will surge more law enforcement to Minneapolis after a U.S. citizen was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday. \"We're sending more officers today and tomorrow; they'll arrive, there'll be hundreds more, in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,\" Noem said in an appearance on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The latest surge comes after Renee Nicole Good, the U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Noem has said, without providing evidence, that Good was engaged in an act of domestic terrorism when she was shot.\"If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,\" Noem claimed in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"This officer was hit by her vehicle, she weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.\" Good, 37, was shot by an ICE agent positioned in front of her car on Wednesday while driving her SUV forward after agents attempted to remove her from her vehicle. The ICE agent has been identified as Jonathan Ross, two sources familiar with the investigation told MS Now.Videos of the incident surfaced on Wednesday, prompting protests and nationwide scrutiny of the Trump administration's tactics as it carries out its mass deportation agenda. The administration and Noem have defended Ross, arguing that Good attempted to run him over with her vehicle, and have pledged to surge additional officers into Minneapolis. The administration had already moved more federal officers to the region amid reports of widespread social services fraud.Pressed by CNN host Jake Tapper over why she was comfortable labeling Good a domestic terrorist before an investigation into the shooting can play out, Noem said, without proof, \"Everything that I've said has been proven to be factual and the truth.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseDemocrats have threatened to impeach Noem over the killing, while noting that an investigation into the incident is underway. On Thursday, state officials with Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension claimed that the FBI is impeding the state-level investigation.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" demanded an impartial investigation of the incident.\"Let's have the investigation in the hands of someone that isn't biased,\" he said. \"Let's not have it exclusively run through the FBI at the federal government or the Department of Justice.\" \"When you've got a federal administration that is so quick to jump on a narrative as opposed to the truth, I think we all need to be speaking out,\" Frey added.Frey also bristled at Noem's characterization of Good's actions. \"They were trying to leave the scene; that is not a person that's trying to run an ICE agent over,\" Frey said.Noem on CNN blamed Frey and other Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for the killing, arguing their rhetoric has prompted people to attempt to obstruct ICE. Frey called for ICE to \"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,\" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.\"They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city, they've inflamed the public,\" Noem said on CNN Sunday. \"They've encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we've seen in Minneapolis the last several days.\"Frey, asked on NBC to respond to Noem, said, \"I'm sorry I offended their delicate ears.\"\"I dropped an F-bomb, and they killed somebody. I think the 'killing somebody' is the inflammatory element here, not the F-bomb,\" Frey said. On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, White House Border Czar Tom Homan argued that everyone should \"let the investigation play out.\"\"I don't know what [the] secretary has that I don't,\" Homan said, though he said he believes what Good did was illegal.This story is developing.

    "body": "Nearly a million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were not in education, employment or training at the end of 2025, per the U.K. Office for National Statistics.Hiraman | E+ | Getty ImagesYoung people are struggling to score their first jobs, and it might be because they're just not ready to enter the workforce, after missing out on critical social development during the Covid-19 pandemic. Joblessness in Generation Z is on the rise as nearly one million young British people, between the ages of 16 and 24, were NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), between July and September 2025, according to the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Identified as a crisis, the government launched an independent review into NEETs in December, led by former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn. Worryingly, the ONS report found that almost 600,000 of those young people who were unemployed were also not actively looking for a job. Young people are facing several challenges in the job market, from artificial intelligence eliminating entry-level positions to increased competition for jobs. More than 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles in the U.K. last year, per The U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers. Meanwhile, the number of job openings have decreased nearly 10% on the year to 729,000 in the September to November period from a year ago, the ONS found. There were 2.5 unemployed people per vacancy between August and October, up from 1.8 the previous year. It's not just the economic climate, with employers and experts saying that Gen Z are not adequately prepared to join the workforce. Milburn told The Times in a recent interview that employers find that young people \"aren't work ready\" when they enter full-time jobs after school. \"Young people don't necessarily have work experience, and what they have learnt at school isn't necessarily pertinent for the world of work.\" Generation Lockdown U.K.-based charity Shaw Trust helps people find employment and is working to end the NEETs crisis. Chief Impact Officer Julie Leonard broke down how virtual learning and being at home during the 2020 lockdown created a socialization gap in Gen Z, particularly between the ages of 20 and 24, in an interview with CNBC Make It. \"You've got a lot of young people who missed out on years of in person, education, work experience, work readiness, soft skills, and who now find themselves adults and in a very difficult job market, and also in a recruitment landscape that has completely changed over the years,\" Leonard said. Soft skills like learning to lead a team, collaboration, following instructions are \"so core to being work-ready,\" and Gen Z \"missed out.\"Many young people weren't forced to get out of their comfort zone at home, which includes talking to strangers, showing up on time for school or work, she added. MP Milburn explained that young people can't be blamed for not being ready to work and said opportunities for young people are in \"sharp decline.\" \"There's been a longstanding decline in 16 and 17-year-olds getting Saturday jobs,\" Milburn said, in comments reported by The Times. \"Previous generations, including mine, were all brought up where most of us had that type of job or had a paper round or whatever. That not only provided youngsters with the opportunity to earn but it also allowed teenagers to learn about what it meant to be in a workplace.Leonard says these part time jobs such as babysitting, gardening, or being on the paper route were \"critical\" to getting young people familiar with the discipline of work. \"We've lost that kind of stepping stone approach that is so critical,\" she said. In fact, employers at Big Four firms like KPMG and PWC have identified that their youngest recruits are lacking essential work etiquette skills like communication and collaboration. PWC started offering resilience training to toughen up its new graduate recruits in 2025 and pinned the lack of \"human-skills\" on the pandemic. In 2023, KPMG started offering soft skill sessions for young recruits including on teamwork and how to give presentations. Ask for jobs in-person Leonard recommends going back to old-school tactics to secure jobs, rather than sitting behind a screen and sending off an endless number of CVs that will eventually be rejected by AI.Indeed, now that job hunting has become primarily digital, many young people are sending off CVs written by AI. \"It's become so depersonalized, and they send off the email, they often get no response whatsoever, which is extremely demotivating,\" Leonard said. Walk into your local shop and ask for a job, advises Julie Leonard, chief impact officer at Shaw Trust. Timnewman | E+ | Getty Images\"Actually, what you do is you make a CV, you go down the high street, you have somebody walk with you and give you that resilience and that confidence to go and say 'I would like a job,'\" she advised saying that this is an exercize Shaw Trust advisors often carry out with young people. The kind of shop where this tactic might be most successful includes local mom-and-pop busineses, bars, cafes, or other small and medium enterprizes. \"You go in there with your CV, you have a conversation with a manager, you start to open doors. That's the type of work that we do. It's the hand holding, the resilience, the confidence building to step out. It's not sitting behind a laptop and just sending CVs,\" Leonard added. ",

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLawmakers this week plan to revisit efforts to pass a market structure bill that will determine the crypto industry's future in the U.S. — reviving legislative efforts that stagnated last year.On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to hold hearings on their respective parts of the crypto bill, where they might revise the text. This will lay the groundwork for establishing legislative guardrails for digital assets in the U.S. — a potential watershed moment for the crypto industry. This is what you need to know about the market structure bill and efforts to pass it. The bill's objectiveThe so-called Clarity Act aims to provide legislative guardrails for the multitrillion-dollar crypto market and big digital asset firms — which could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto in the U.S. It seeks to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's and Commodities Futures Trading Commission's roles in regulating cryptocurrencies, in addition to creating more well-defined token classifications. It also aims to outline registration and compliance standards for a wide range of crypto brokerages, exchanges and other entities, enabling them to operate more easily in the U.S. Those guardrails could help the U.S. court more digital assets companies to set up shop stateside, stimulating the economy and boosting the crypto market, according to Summer Mersinger, CEO of crypto trade group Blockchain Association.\"We've seen this massive movement of companies and activity back on shore because there is a friendly administration to crypto,\" Mersinger said. But, without a market structure law, \"that could all go away, especially if there's a change to an unfriendly administration.\"That said, the bill's implications for digital asset companies, crypto holders and other investors won't be 100% clear until the draft legislation's language is finalized. What's happening this weekLawmakers will attempt to hash out three key issues this week: stablecoin-linked rewards; the treatment of decentralized finance platforms and their developers; and the matter of blocking elected officials such as President Donald Trump from profiting off of crypto ventures. Trump-affiliated entities have launched both a memecoin and nonfungible token in the past. The stablecoin issue is \"the biggest outstanding issue\" for negotiations on the Hill, said Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber.\"Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill,\" Carbone said. \"Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.\"In early January, the American Bankers Association's Community Bankers Council wrote to Senate members, asking them to prevent stablecoin issuer affiliates from offering rewards to customers. The stablecoin products, they said, exploit a loophole in the stablecoin-centric Genius Act passed last year that prohibits dollar-pegged tokens that offer yields to holders — which pose an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts and other traditional products. On the DeFi front, crypto advocates are fighting to ensure developers do not face prosecution when their technology is used for illicit activities like money laundering. \"We're very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill… but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn't some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can't comply,\" DeFi Education Fund chief legal officer Amanda Tuminelli told CNBC. DeFi advocates also want to ensure the market structure bill contains language allowing individuals to self-custody their crypto. In addition, they want provisions from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that call for software developers and blockchain service providers who do not control or custody customer funds to be exempt from registering as money-transmitting businesses. Finally, some lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) want to prevent public officials from profiting off of digital asset ventures while they serve. \" It's a really hard issue,\" Mersinger said. \"They ended up kind of punting [on] it in the House because it was really difficult to put on the bill. A lot of Senate Democrats have said, 'We're not going to punt on this issue.'\" 'Key window'The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to put out new drafts of the market structure bill, with the aim of discussing and revising details of the proposed legislation Thursday at markup, according to Mersinger. Later, they will join the two documents to create one big crypto bill. That draft will go to the Senate floor, where discussions could take several weeks, before potentially making its way through the rest of the lawmaking process to become law. Crypto proponents want to see the bill passed before the 2026 midterm elections in case some of the industry's allies are unseated in November and to avoid losing momentum on the Hill, Mersinger told CNBC. \"There's a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year, and so this is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that's needed to get it done,\" Mersinger said. ",

    "body": "A Walmart sign hangs on the exterior of the store on Nov. 20, 2025 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWalmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club.Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with \"Instant Checkout,\" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" Furner said in a news release. \"We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.\"In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is \"rewriting the retail playbook\" and, with AI, it's \"trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.\"Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a \"transformative\" moment.For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI \"helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.\" \"Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,\" he said.Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that \"it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.\"",

    "body": "Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has a nightly ritual that helps her stay confident while running her baby formula business, she said in an Oct. 7 episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast.Every night, Modi does a \"personal and professional check-in,\" and mentally ranks her day on a scale of one to five from both perspectives, she said. The routine helps her reflect and process her feelings as she gets ready for bed, she added.\"There's moments where you have to take the internal check-in and remind yourself that you're being human, that's OK, and then put your thick skin back on,\" said Modi.Modi, a former director of host operations at Airbnb, quit her job to co-found Bobbie in 2018. After having her first child two years earlier, she was frustrated by ingredients found in typical baby formulas, she told CNBC Make It in July 2023. The company, which sells organic U.S.-made baby formula, brings in an estimated $64.84 million per year in revenue and has raised approximately $185.01 million in total equity funding, according to FactSet.While Modi has always had thick skin, she said, her nightly check-ins help her celebrate her wins and recover from rough days while growing her company and raising her family, she said.\"I think sometimes you have to regulate your feelings and emotions on a wild ride, personally and professionally,\" said Modi, now the mother of four children. \"The good months or the good years come and go [and] the daily moments just allow me to stay focused and grounded.\"Former Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg had a similar emotional regulation habit while at the helm of company, which he ran for seven years before leaving the role in October. Each morning, he'd rank his mood on a scale of one to 10 to help him get in the \"right mood and right energy\" to lead the business, he said at the Fast Company Innovation Festival 2023.His sweet spot was when he felt he between three and seven, he said: That meant he felt \"energized\" and able to work and collaborate at high level. If he felt any lower, he usually secluded himself in his office until he was in a better headspace to work with others, he added.  Learning how to regulate your emotions is a form of emotional intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ), that all leaders need to master, leadership expert Scott Mautz wrote for CNBC Make It in July 2024. Reflecting on your missteps and successes, in particular, can help you build your mental strength, he wrote.\"Mentally strong people understand that we're defined not by what knocks us down, but by how we get back up,\" wrote Mautz. \"They treat mistakes as missteps and not 'mis-leaps' meaning they're careful not to exaggerate the negative impact of a setback.\"  You could take an extra step and write those reflections down in a journal, too. \"Self-reflection through writing provides measurable cognitive and emotional benefits by helping process experiences and clarify thinking,\" psychiatrist Drew Ramsey wrote on March 25.\"Meta-analyses have found that expressive writing can improve both physical and psychological health outcomes,\" he wrote. \"Neuroimaging studies reveal that labeling emotions through writing ... [can] effectively reducing emotional reactivity.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

One is a 1963 Chevrolet K20. The other is a new Silverado EV. The trucks, while part of a temporary holiday display, are symbolic of what's inside the new global offices for the Detroit automaker: its past and present, woven together.GM is occupying four of six office floors of the building and has filled them with artifacts, design nods and \"Easter eggs\" tied to the Detroit automaker's history. They range from a blueprint of GM's iconic design dome and an early map of its nearby proving grounds to an interior wallpaper of 300 patented technologies and a decorative wall of cassette tapes with songs featuring the automaker's brands as well playful references to executive stalwarts such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.One of the centerpiece objects of GM's new headquarters is the McCormick Speed Form, an aerodynamic wind-tunnel model developed at the Warren Technical Center.Courtesy: GM\"Leadership asked when we were helping design the space to bring in some Easter eggs and details to represent who we are at GM, you know, honoring our culture and our history and our innovation,\" Rebecca Waldmeir, GM industrial design architecture and experience manager, told CNBC during a tour of the new headquarters.Other surprises include references to relevant Detroit streets, design influences from GM's famed design campus in suburban Detroit and artwork and sculptures of its products.Aside from the aesthetics, GM officials say the new offices will assist with collaboration and are more relevant to how the company expects its employees to work in a post-pandemic world. It will house executive offices and other corporate functions such as marketing, legal and finance.\"A headquarters really should be, at some level, a beacon for the culture of the company,\" said David Massaron, GM vice president of infrastructure and corporate citizenship. \"When you come in here, it should help people understand who we want to be.\"A wall inside GM's new Detroit headquarters includes cassette tape cases featuring songs referencing the automaker's brands and vehicles as well as custom ones featuring GM executives such as CEO Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss.Michael Wayland | CNBCFrom fortress to functionalityThe new headquarters marks a significant square-foot reduction for the automaker's corporate office — from a towering complex called the Renaissance Center along the city's riverfront to just four floors, roughly 200,000 square feet, in the new building.GM's new HQ is less than a mile from the RenCen, as it's commonly called, which has been a symbol for the city since, ironically, Ford Motor built the complex but decided not to make it its headquarters in the 1970s. GM purchased the building in 1996 as its third headquarters, all of which have been in the Motor City.The RenCen is Detroit's fortress, a 5.6-million-square-foot complex complete with a more-than-700-foot center tower surrounded by four 500-foot towers and two smaller adjacent ones. GM's new headquarters at the Hudson's Detroit development in the city's downtown.Courtesy: GMThe complex is infamously difficult to get in and out of and to navigate. For much of its existence, it was surrounded by concrete barriers before a redesign around the turn of the millennium. It has long been something of a physical permutation of GM's historically siloed culture, which Barra has made a priority to change during her roughly 11-year tenure as CEO.\"The RenCen was designed in a different era, in a pre-Covid era where everybody went to work five days a week, everybody went to their desk,\" Massaron said. \"Particularly, in a post-pandemic world, you need office space that people want to come to, because we have options.\"GM's roughly 50,000 U.S. salaried employees are currently required to work in-office Tuesday through Thursday, but the rules are more flexible than before regarding location and remote working. The Renaissance Center (complex of skyscrapers with the Chrevrolet sign) by the Detroit River.Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMost of the company's new executive offices on the top floor of the building will be open for executives to use as they please, Massaron said. Only four of the offices will be permanently assigned to top GM executives, such as Barra and Reuss, he said.GM declined to disclose how many employees are expected to regularly work at the new headquarters, saying foot traffic will fluctuate based on priorities and workflows. The company also declined to disclose financial details of its 15-year lease at the new headquarters.The building complex, known as Hudson's Detroit, is owned by a real estate company of Rocket Companies chairman and billionaire Dan Gilbert, who has been purchasing and renovating properties in Detroit for more than a decade.Showroom, pickleball Aside from the office areas and the executive floor, which all overlook an open atrium, GM also plans to open a semi-public space to display products and host events on the first floor of the building. Other amenities include social gathering areas and lounges, food and beverage services and a pickleball court and recreation area. A common area outside of the executive offices of GM's new headquarters in downtown Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM's new headquarters, which remains under construction, comes months after Ford christened a new 2.1-million-square-foot global HQ and product design and development center in nearby Dearborn, Michigan.Ford's new facility includes offices, design and industrial operations and a host of amenities such as a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts,\" multiple courtyards and other upgrades.The notable difference in the size between GM's and Ford's new headquarters comes down to location, headcount and the automakers' portfolios of offices and operations throughout the region.A pickleball court and seating area inside the building that includes GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCGM, for example, has a vast technology and design center that occupies 710 acres in nearby Warren, Michigan. That campus houses more than 24,000 employees. Massaron said GM didn't feel it needed to create \"a city within a city\" for its new headquarters, because it's actually \"a building within a city.\"Here's a look inside GM's new world headquarters:The entry of the executive floor inside GM's new global headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCThe executive hallway of GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Courtesy: GMOne of a dozen or so executive offices inside GM's new headquarters in downtown Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCOne of a dozen or so executive offices inside GM's new headquarters in downtown Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCThe interior design draws inspiration from Eero Saarinen’s iconic GM Global Technical Center, incorporating golden\nmetallic finishes, wood feature walls, warm recessed lighting and a blend of clean linear geometries with subtle\ncurves.Courtesy: GMPatent wall graphics highlight 300 of more than 49,000\npatents granted since the company’s founding in 1911.Courtesy: GMA wall of cassette tapes celebrates GM’s broad cultural impact, nodding to the more than 78,000 songs that\nreference GM brands and vehicles.Courtesy: GMA model of the Chevrolet Corvette CX concept hangs on the wall outside the executive boardroom of GM's new headquarters.Courtesy: GMThe executive boardroom inside GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Courtesy: GMInside the common atrium area of GM's new global headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCA coffee shop and cafe inside the atrium area of GM's new global headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCA common lounge area near the atrium of the building that houses GM's new headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBCThree-dimensional sound-wave art profiles feature engine and EV tones from notable GM vehicles across\nperformance, EV and ICE categories, transforming acoustic engineering into sculptural expression.Courtesy: GMA statue of GM's \"Cadillac Goddess\" sits on a table inside the executive floor of its new headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland | CNBC",

    "body": "Are we in an artificial intelligence bubble?It's the debate that dominated the tech industry in 2025, and it's not going away anytime soon.Record valuations and deals driven by major investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI boom, leaving some to brace for the potential burst.AI leaders like OpenAI and Nvidia have spun an impressive web of staggering deals with cloud infrastructure companies, while hyperscalers including Amazon, Microsoft and Google continue to spend billions on data center buildouts.Although companies are racing to supply the rapidly accelerating AI demand, the enormous debt financing these buildouts have sparked worry that the spending spree may prove to be an overreach.Economic bubbles occur when asset prices in a specific market rapidly rise, often due to speculation or overenthusiasm, followed by a crash when prices suddenly drop.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta faces China probe over acquisition of AI agent startup ManusMicrosoft revealed as company behind controversial data center proposal in Michigan townshipAlphabet's market cap surpasses Apple's for first time since 2019Google, Character.AI to settle suits involving minor suicides and AI chatbotsBubble talks ignited again at the end of last year after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of a possible AI bust during the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" he said. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Others have been less confident in the stability of the AI surge, including \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry. The fund manager, who rose to fame for predicting the 2008 housing crisis, drew parallels between the current spending euphoria and the dot-com mania of the late 1990s in a lengthy Substack essay.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles,\" Burry wrote in an October X post. \"Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a similar comparison during a dinner with reporters in August.\"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,\" he said.A note on methodology:CNBC compiled responses from 40 tech executives, analysts and other professionals in the space, who shared their thoughts over the past four months about the current AI frenzy.Although the question of whether or not the market is in a bubble seems binary, many answers have landed across a spectrum of bubble potential — and worry.To give each response a more rounded perspective, CNBC also weighed the level of concern.CNBC scored each person's remarks on a scale from 0 to 10 on two factors: How much they believe that AI is in a bubble (0 being no and 10 being yes) and how concerned they are about it (0 being not concerned at all and 10 being very concerned).",

    "body": "Farcia Harvey considers herself to be pretty well traveled. The 27-year-old has crossed off New York City, New Orleans for Mardi Gras, Barcelona and Madrid from her travel bucket list. But one of her favorite trips was her 2024 birthday trip to Cincinnati, of all places.\"I think about that trip to Cincinnati genuinely all of the time,\" Harvey tells CNBC Make It, saying she wanted somewhere not too far from her home at the time in Nashville, but not a staycation either. \"It's one of the best memories I have for my birthday, and it's something that to this day, me and my friends still talk about.\"Some of her highlights were hitting the Somerset outdoor bar, Brown Bear Bakery, the Riverfront's walking paths and the city's free streetcar downtown — simpler and slower luxuries that bigger cities may not offer.Her social media posts hyping Cincinnati and under-the-radar cities last summer went viral with over 1 million views on Instagram and Tiktok, prompting thousands of comments shouting out other secondary cities worth a visit.Harvey's love of hidden gem travel is part of a bigger trend where vacationers are seeking slower, more enriching trips away from the busyness of big-city destinations.\"A lot of people truly believe in order to be well traveled, they have to see Europe, they have to see Africa, all of these other places,\" Harvey says. That may be true for some, but not all, she says: \"You can have a great time in the middle of nowhere.\" Farcia Harvey says a birthday road trip from Nashville to Cincinnati was the most memorable vacation she's taken, despite having traveled to major cities around the world.Kaitlyn FitzpatrickSlow travel meets the farmFarm-stay vacations, in particular, are seeing a boom: 84% of travelers said they're interested in staying on or near a farm, according to a recent report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. Interest in rural escapes has boomed for Gen Z travelers over the past two years, with a 300% spike year-over-year in guest reviews mentioning farms on Vrbo.Even life milestone celebrations are getting the slow travel treatment. Aricka Giglia, 28, gathered 10 of her best girlfriends for her bachelorette at a farm outside Dallas last spring.The LA resident wanted her bachelorette to feel more like a wellness retreat than a typical party weekend. But finding the right venue was the challenge.Aricka Giglia of LA hosted her bachelorette on a farm outside Dallas last spring.Courtesy of Aricka GigliaShe ended up booking a three-night stay at Lavender Hill Farmhouse, drawn to its features of a chicken coop, fields with cows and horses, a pond with paddle boats, an outdoor grill where they hosted a hibachi dinner, and a big kitchen where they invited a private chef for another.\"I don't think any of us have traveled intentionally to be with nature,\" Giglia says. \"If it's nature, it's tropical, but it's never a farm.\"\"It's this slow travel movement. People just want a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. \"Specifically they're looking for access to nature walks, hiking, but then, very specific to farm stays, they want a chance to interact with farm animals.\"The unconventional stay was also affordable, Giglia says, estimating her guests paid about $250 each for the weekend — a steal compared to her husband's bachelor party in Los Cabos, Mexico, that ran about $800 per head.Going big on reading retreatsGroup trips at under-the-radar cities have become a big part of Mackenzie Newcomb's business running the Bad Bitch Book Club from New York City.The club, started in 2018, launched its annual summer camp trip for readers to meet in-person in July 2021. About 28 people showed up at the Northern Outdoors campgrounds in Forks, Maine. It was such a hit that the club now hosts reading trips across the U.S. once a month that cost between $900 to $1,500 for basic room packages and a weekend of meals and activities. Last year, BBBC hosted three weeks of summer camp; 400 people applied for 200 spots, Newcomb, 32, says.The Bad Bitch Book Club's annual summer retreat attracts hundreds of people for a weekend of reading and socializing.Courtesy of Mackenzie NewcombDemand is likely to grow: 91% of travelers saying they're interested in taking a trip centered around reading, relaxation and quality time, according to Expedia's travel trends report. Mentions of reading-related terms in Vrbo guest reviews has surged 285% year-over-year, and searches for \"book retreats\" and \"book club retreat ideas\" are up on Pinterest.\"I'm going to credit Booktok with the dramatic rise in what Vrbo is calling 'readaways,'\" says Fish, the travel expert. \"Groups are headed to these serene destinations, coastal homes, country retreats, or just cozy, multi-bedroom getaways with a porch swing that they're dying to curl up in, and their goal is to read.\" There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view.Mackenzie NewcombCEO and founder of the Bad Bitch Book ClubWhen choosing the right location for a reading retreat, splashier cities aren't always the best move, Newcomb says.Newcomb's least favorite retreats were in Nashville and New Orleans, great cities in their own right, but not good for a reading trip \"because it's all about exploring and not at all about relaxing,\" she says. \"There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view. When I'm looking for homes, I tend to look for places that people would be just as happy just being in that rental house the entire weekend reading as they would going out and exploring the area.\"To that end, some of her favorite lit trips have taken place in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Savannah, Georgia; Door County, Wisconsin; Holland, Michigan; The Berkshires in Massachusetts; and Mount Snow, Vermont.Hocking Hills, Ohio, about an hour south of Columbus, is \"a strong contender for a future trip,\" Newcomb says, adding that members have been \"vouching very strongly\" for a book club retreat there for years. \"And of course I'm like, 'I don't want to go to Ohio,' but they insist that it's going to be the place to go.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump looks on as he signs executive orders and proclamations in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 5, 2025. Leah Millis | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's attack on Venezuela and threats to other countries, as well as concerns about affordability, exposed fractures within the congressional GOP this week at the start of a challenging midterm election year.Trump avoided defeat when most House Republicans declined to override the first of two vetoes of his presidency, which spiked a pair of nonpartisan infrastructure bills that would've benefited Colorado and Florida.But it was otherwise a less-than-stellar week for Trump on Capitol Hill, though Republicans are projecting confidence.\"This isn't an unusual situation, particularly coming into midterm elections, where you have senators that are in tough situations,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., said Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"A senior White House official said the defectors represent just a \"tiny fraction\" of congressional Republicans.\"Republicans aren't always going to have the same views as the president,\" the White House official said.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseStill, cracks in GOP unity emerged on multiple fronts.On Thursday, 17 House Republicans broke ranks and voted with Democrats on legislation to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years, despite opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and the widespread unpopularity of the Obamacare subsidies within the Republican party. The White House official said Trump opposes a three-year extension, but the vote was not viewed internally as a defeat.The enhanced tax credits were first enacted under President Joe Biden in 2021 and have been a focal point of Democratic messaging on health care and affordability. The credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in sharply higher premiums for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces.Many of those who supported the bill to extend the tax credits were among the most vulnerable Republicans in the 2026 midterms.\"I have long opposed the damage the Unaffordable Care Act has done to our country, but I will not watch Wisconsinites lose health care because Democrats let their own law collapse,\" Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., who voted for their extension, posted on X. Van Orden is running for reelection in a toss up district, according to Cook Political Report.Earlier on Thursday, five Senate Republicans bucked the president and joined Democrats on a procedural vote that could rein in his ability to take military action in Venezuela. Trump responded in a Truth Social post that \"Republicans should be ashamed\" of the senators who supported the preliminary vote and said they \"should never be elected to office again.\"Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., one of the members called out by Trump, declined to comment on the president's comments on Thursday. When asked if he was open to changing his stance on subsequent War Powers votes, Young told reporters, \"Why would I?\"The White House, however, said there is a \"significant\" chance future votes on the resolution might go the president's way.\"A number of these members have left the door open to additional conversations,\" the senior official said.Meanwhile, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who is retiring at the end of his term in January 2027, has found himself at odds with the administration on several fronts. On Wednesday, Tillis took aim at White House senior adviser Stephen Miller from the Senate floor, calling Miller's comments about the U.S. taking over Greenland \"amateurish\" and \"stupid.\" The White House official called those remarks \"disappointing.\"A day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents killed a civilian in Minnesota, Tillis also announced he was blocking all Department of Homeland Security nominees. Tillis, however, said the hold was not related to the shooting, and instead had to do with Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem so far refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\"All I'm saying is, you need to show respect to a committee of jurisdiction,\" Tillis told reporters this week.And on Thursday, Tillis and Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., secured passage of a resolution to place a plaque honoring police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6 in the Senate. Language authorizing the plaque was passed into law as part of a larger appropriations bill in 2022. The monument was supposed to be displayed on the West front of the Capitol by March 2023, but had been blocked by House Republicans.Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have sought to shift the narrative on Jan. 6. On the five-year anniversary this week, the White House launched a web page casting blame on Democrats, then-Vice President Mike Pence, and Capitol Police for the violence that transpired that day.Officers \"risked their lives to defend the United States Capitol and protect members of Congress. Their brave actions upheld the rule of law and ensured that our democratic institutions could continue to function as intended,\" Tillis said in a statement. When asked about the plaque, the White House official said, \"The administration doesn't have a position on the decorations of the Capitol.\"",

    "body": "Eugene Mymrin | Moment | Getty ImagesAll computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand.That's because companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components. Three primary memory vendors — Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand. \"We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income nearly tripled in the most recent quarter. Samsung this week said that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is considering a U.S. listing as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand for its entire 2026 RAM production capacity. Now, prices for memory are rising. TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\" Three-to-one basisChipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers. Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduces the Rubin GPU and the Vera CPU as he speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 5, 2026. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBut the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\"When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices.\"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said. Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive. In December, Micron said it would discontinue a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers. Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased. Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time. \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday.watch now'Memory wall'AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and Meta.Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.  While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs. \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said. The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\" Erik Isakson | Digitalvision | Getty Images\"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said.More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience. Majestic Labs is designing an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power.Sold out for 2026 Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like Apple and Dell Technologies, how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025. In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\"But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices. \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\"Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products.At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage. Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high.\"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said. At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030.But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said. ",

Mattias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesIn a time of geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some steady portfolio income.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive stocks of companies that generate solid cash flows to support continued dividend payments.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Permian ResourcesWe start this week with Permian Resources (PR), an independent oil and natural gas company with assets in the Permian Basin, with a concentration in the core of the Delaware Basin. At a base dividend of 15 cents per share (an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share), PR stock offers a dividend yield of 4.3%.In a recent research report, Siebert Williams analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price forecast of $19, saying, \"Extending track record of operational execution with a near-term focus on 4Q25, where the implied oil production guidance midpoint is ~187.4 Mbbls/d on a capex of $484.6 mn.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.Sorbara noted that Permian is sticking to its plan to reward shareholders through a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share and opportunistic stock buybacks. Notably, the company has a $1 billion buyback authorization with no end date. The five-star analyst expects Permian to raise its dividend next year and beyond. Meanwhile, Sorbara expects the company to release its 2026 outlook in February once it finalizes a plan that fits the commodity price and service cost backdrop. The analyst expects Permian to benefit from several positives in 2026, including lower drilling costs, an increased production base in the second half of last year, steady operational strength, and better pricing from recent deals. Sorbara expects these tailwinds to drive efficiency in production, capital spending and free cash flow.Additionally, Sorbara noted Permian's efforts to further strengthen its balance sheet, aiming for a long term net-debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) target of 0.5x-1.0x. Also, the $500 million to $1 billion of cash on hand gives the company flexibility to execute capital allocation options like acquisitions, buybacks, and debt reduction even at West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the range of $35 to $40/bbl.Sorbara ranks No. 522 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.4%. See Permian Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.International Business MachinesTech giant IBM (IBM) is this week's second dividend pick. The company returned $1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in the third quarter of 2025. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.2%.Recently, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded IBM stock to buy from hold and raised the price target to $360 from $300, citing \"a clearer path to software acceleration, improving fundamentals, and valuation not yet fully reflecting the software premium.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $354.The five-star analyst noted management's more favorable outlook across key growth areas, with tech transformation and rapid AI adoption fueling broad-based demand. Thill noted that improving regulatory and tax policies, solid organic software growth, synergies from recent mergers and acquisitions and key wins in generative AI consulting are also supporting management's optimism.Notably, synergies from the HashiCorp acquisition and the pending Confluent (CFLT) deal are expected to drive accelerated software growth in 2026 compared to just under 10% exiting 2025. Thill also expects IBM to deliver consistently improving margins (estimates pretax margin of 21% in 2027 compared to 19% in 2025), driven by a growing software mix and operational discipline.With IBM trading at 26x 2027 P/E multiple, compared to the large-cap software peer average of 35x, Thill finds the stock's valuation attractive and contends that it still has upside as the software reacceleration expectation is not priced in.Thill ranks No. 539 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See IBM Statistics on TipRanks. Kinetik HoldingsKinetik Holdings (KNTK) is a midstream energy company focused on the Delaware Basin in the Permian. With a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share (an annualized dividend of $3.12 per share), KNTK stock offers a yield of 8.5%.On Jan. 5, Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins upgraded Kinetik stock to buy from hold with a price target of $46. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating with a price target of $34.\"The stock is down ~38% TTM, and the magnitude of that reset is a core component of our thesis as investor focus shifts toward 2026-27, where operational visibility improves while valuation continues to reflect meaningful skepticism,\" said Jenkins.Jenkins believes that KNTK's risk-reward is getting more attractive, with the earnings outlook for 2026 to 2027 becoming clearer. The improving earnings expectations are backed by more meaningful full-year contributions from the Kings Landing project and better system connectivity as the ECCC pipeline moves toward its Q2 2026 start-up.The analyst's optimism is also backed by its acid-gas injection project, planned for late 2026, which will open access to more sour gas and ease utilization constraints in the Delaware system. Jenkins also expects several macro and operational factors that affected 2025 performance to improve into mid-2026, including Waha price conditions and additional volumes tied to Permian dry gas expansion.Trading at about 8x 2027 EV/EBITDA, at the low end of the midstream peer group valuation range of 8x to 12x, Jenkins finds KNTK stock attractive, with the balance sheet getting stronger after the divestiture of its equity interest in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP. Interestingly, Jenkins sees the possibility of KNTK being a buyout target for midstream companies that want to combine more Permian NGL (natural gas liquids) volumes.Jenkins ranks No. 63 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.1%. See Kinetik Holdings Financials on TipRanks. ",

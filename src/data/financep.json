    "body": "U.S. and Taiwanese flags are seen in San Francisco, California, Jan. 28, 2026. Stephen Nellis | ReutersWashington and Taipei have signed a trade deal lowering tariffs on Taiwanese exports to 15%, on par with those on Asian allies Japan and South Korea, while the island will open its market for U.S. goods. Taiwan will remove or reduce 99% of tariff barriers on U.S. goods, as well as provide \"preferential market access\" for U.S. industrial and agricultural exports. These include autos, beef products and minerals. Taiwan also plans to purchase over $84 billion in U.S. goods from 2025 to 2029, including liquefied natural gas and crude oil, as well as aircraft and power equipment. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that Taiwan had committed to \"resolve longstanding non-tariff barriers,\" such as accepting U.S. vehicles built to U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards without any additional requirements. This deal was first announced in January when Taiwanese chip and technology companies committed to invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., backed by an equal amount of government credit \"to facilitate additional investment by Taiwanese enterprises.\" However, Taiwan and the U.S. have shared differing views on chip supply chains.The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. during U.S. President , Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last month. He also said that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff.However, Taiwan has pushed back on that proposal, telling Washington that moving 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was \"impossible,\" according to Taipei's top tariff trade negotiator.Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun told local media that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not simply be relocated.Taiwan's international expansion, including its investments in the U.S., is predicated on the notion that the industry remains' rooted in Taiwan and continues to expand domestic investments, she said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.China, which considers democratically governed Taiwan a part of its territory, had criticized the January agreement, saying that the deal would \"only drain Taiwan's economic interests,\" adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was letting the U.S. \"hollow out\" the island's key industry. Chinese President Xi Jinping regards Taiwan's reunification with the mainland \"a historical inevitability.\" Taiwan rejects those claims. While the U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and is not obligated to defend the island, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act states the U.S. \"will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services\" as may be necessary to \"enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.\"The U.S. in December approved $11.15 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, among its largest deals with the island as it faces growing threats from China, drawing a sharp response from Beijing, with its foreign affairs spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, accusing the U.S. of violating the \"one-China principle.\"— CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dylan Butts contributed to this story.",

(Photo by Philippe LOPEZ / AFP via Getty Images)Philippe Lopez | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia approved the purchase of Rafale fighter jets from France on Thursday, marking one of its largest aircraft orders, ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to the country.The approval was part of New Delhi's 3.6 trillion rupee ($39.7 billion) defence spending package covering multiple acquisitions across the armed forces.The Defence Ministry did not specify how many aircraft would be ordered. Local media reported that India will purchase 114 Rafale jets, with 18 supplied by manufacturer Dassault and the remaining 96 manufactured domestically.The broader package includes Boeing P8I Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft for its navy, anti-tank mines for its ground forces, and upgrades to its Soviet-era T-72 tanks and BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles.The new aircraft are expected to help address a shortfall in the Indian air force, which operates 29 squadrons against a minimum requirement of 42, according to a 2024 parliamentary report. The air force most recently retired two squadrons of Cold War-era MiG-21 fighters in September 2025, and is expected to phase out additional aircraft in the coming years.The Rafale purchase follows another order in April for 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for India's Navy. Dassault said India would become the first user outside France to operate this variant. Rafale jets were used by the Indian Air Force during its 2025 conflict with Pakistan, when at least one aircraft was reported lost in combat against Islamabad's Chinese-made J-10Cs.Macron, who will be in India from Feb. 17 to 19, is scheduled to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss expanding bilateral cooperation across sectors.The two leaders will also launch the India-France Year of Innovation and attend the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, according to India's external affairs ministry.\"The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of mutual interest, including cooperation in the Indo-Pacific,\" the release added.

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.\"This is about as big as it gets,\"  President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. \"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding.\" Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. \"No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles,\" he said.The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersZeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history. Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. \"less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.\"The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized \"climate denialism as official government policy.\" It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA. Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs. ",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler listens as President Barack Obama speaks at an installation ceremony for FBI Director James Comey at FBI Headquarters in Washington, Monday, Oct. 28, 2013.Charles Dharapak | APTop Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler said Thursday night that she will leave the investment bank at the end of June, a decision that came after a flurry of news articles highlighting documents detailing the former White House counsel's often chummy email conversations with the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Goldman, for months, has defended Ruemmler after Congress and then the Department of Justice released emails between her and Epstein, as well as other documents related to investigations of him. Ruemmler, who has been a key advisor to Goldman CEO David Solomon since joining the bank in 2020, told The Financial Times on Thursday, \"I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction.\"The FT first reported the 54-year-old's decision to leave Goldman.\"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do,\" Ruemmler said in a statement to CNBC.\"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,\" Ruemmler said.\"Earlier today, I regretfully informed David Solomon of my intention to step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.\"Solomon, in a statement, said, \"Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm.\"\"As one of the most  accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision,\" Solomon said.Her announcement that she will leave Goldman comes nearly a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people whom Epstein called on July 6, 2019, after being arrested by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges at an airport in New Jersey. The Journal's report cites a handwritten set of notes by law enforcement about comments Epstein made inside an FBI vehicle after his arrest.Those notes are among documents released in late January by the Department of Justice, CNBC has confirmed.Other news articles detailed emails and documents showing how Epstein had made gifts to Ruemmler that included a Hermes bag, and other luxury items, such as a Fendi purse, spa visits, Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and flowers. On one occasion, she effusively thanked him, calling him \"Uncle Jeffrey,\" one email showed.Ruemmler was a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins during the years she was speaking with Epstein, whom she met in 2014.An Aug. 14, 2014, email contained in the DOJ's Epstein files shows how he asked her to represent his client, Bank Edmond de Rothschild.\"They have a justice department problem ... like every other swiss bank,\" Epstein wrote her.Ruemmler took the bank as a client for Latham.Ruemmler has said that she never represented Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail weeks after his 2019 arrest.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinRuemmler's spokeswoman, Jennifer Connelly, told the Journal for its story last Friday, \"These documents are consistent with what Ms. Ruemmler has repeatedly said: She knew Epstein when she was a criminal defense attorney and shared a client with him.\"\"She was friendly with him in that context. She had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part,\" Connelly said.Ruemmler previously served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.She is the latest person to lose a high-profile position because of her prior association with Epstein.On Sunday, Morgan Sweeney resigned as chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. Starmer fired Mandelson from that post in September over disclosures about his connection to Epstein.Last week, Brad Karp, chairman of the major corporate law firm Paul Weiss, resigned from that post after fallout over emails between him and Epstein. Karp is staying at the firm.\"In response to the Epstein emails, a Paul Weiss spokesman previously said, \"Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"Karp said he was leaving the chairman's post because of the distraction of the news stories.In November, after a congressional committee released emails between Ruemmler and Epstein, Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto told CNBC, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said at the time.Ruemmler has previously told the Journal that she regrets ever knowing Epstein.Among the new tranche of emails that the DOJ released in late January is one that Ruemmler sent Epstein in March 2019, four months before his arrest.In that email, she offered advice on how to respond to criticism that he had previously received special treatment and a light punishment in 2008 because of his wealth and political connections when he avoided federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. At the time Epstein sought Ruemmler's advice, he had been the subject of a series of articles in the Miami Herald that were critical of the decision by federal prosecutors not to file charges against him in 2008. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in state prison in Florida, but was allowed out to go to his office during the day for much of that time.The subject line of the email thread, \"From wapo,\" suggests that Epstein was reaching out to Ruemmler because of an inquiry by The Washington Post about him.Ruemmler wrote in the email: \"Something like: … 'The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental [misunderstanding] of both the facts underlying Mr. Epstein's case and how it was [prosecuted] by both local and federal authorities.\"\"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offenses] of sexual solicitation,\" Ruemmler wrote. \"He accepted responsibility, served [time and] prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims [involved].\"Ruemmler, in a bracketed section, also suggested saying something like, \"But for his wealth, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Epstein … would have received the aggressive treatment that he did from [federal] prosecutors, and he certainly would never have been subjected to the [salacious] and malicious treatment by the media that he continues to receive more than 10 years after the case was resolved.\"",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Airbnb were up about 2% in extended trading Thursday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for revenue and offered rosy guidance for the current period.Here's how the company did based on analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 66 cents expectedRevenue: $2.78 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedFor the current period, Airbnb said it expects to report revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.53 billion for the quarter, according to LSEG. The company said it expects full-year revenue growth of \"at least low double digits.\" Analysts were expecting 10.2% growth.Airbnb's revenue increased 12% during the fourth quarter from $2.48 billion during the same period last year. Airbnb has beat Wall Street's revenue expectations for 20 of the past 21 quarters, according to FactSet.The company reported net income of $341 million, or 56 cents per share, down from $461 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Airbnb attributed the lower figure to $90 million of non-income tax matters and planned investments in new growth and policy initiatives, according to a release.  Airbnb said it finished 2025 with \"strong momentum,\" and that its results reflect the strength of its core business. The company connects users who are willing to rent out their homes with travelers who are looking for places to stay. The company reported 121.9 million nights and seats booked in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and above the 117.6 million expected by StreetAccount.Gross booking value, which Airbnb uses to report host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 16% year over year. That figure is above the $19.4 billion expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount.Airbnb reported adjusted EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of $786 million during the period.Last month, Airbnb announced it hired Ahmad Al-Dahle, former head of generative artificial intelligence at Meta, as its new tech chief.

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it \"a new housing crisis.\"Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.91 million, according to the NAR. Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022.This count is based on closings, so contracts that were likely signed in November and December, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage didn't move much before dropping slightly in January. That rate is now 6.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Regionally, sales fell across the nation month to month but were down the most in the South and West. \"Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR's Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022,\" Yun said in a release. \"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.\"But he also noted on a call with reporters that potential buyers are \"still struggling,\" and \"renters are not participating in housing wealth.\" He characterized the current market as a crisis because, \"the movement is not happening. Americans are stuck.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.Tighter supply kept home prices in positive territory. The median price for a home sold in January was $396,800, up 0.9% year over year and the highest January price on record. \"Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth,\" Yun added.Homes are taking longer to sell, at 46 days in January versus 41 in January 2025. About 31% of sales were to first-time buyers, up from 28% a year ago. Sales continue to be strongest on the higher end of the market; in fact, the only price segment in the positive from a year ago was the $1 million-plus range. Sales dropped the most for homes priced below $250,000.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo's cars are driven without humans. But when a departing passenger leaves a door open, the car won't move until a person closes it. For that task, Waymo is turning to gig workers from companies like DoorDash. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company confirmed on Thursday that it's running a pilot in Atlanta to compensate delivery drivers for closing Waymo doors that are left ajar. DoorDash drivers are notified when a Waymo in the area has an open door so the vehicles can quickly get back on the road, the company said.That acknowledgement came after a Reddit post showed a DoorDash driver in Atlanta was offered $11.25 to close the door of a nearby Waymo.Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint statement to CNBC that they are always looking for new and flexible ways for DoorDash deliverers to earn money, adding that future Waymo vehicles will have automated door closures. Waymo didn't say when that capability will arrive. Waymo's reliance on people for simple tasks underscores how even the most advanced autonomous technologies still require costly human intervention for some basic operations. Valued at $126 billion in a recent financing round, Waymo is central to Alphabet's Other Bets, which are targeted at \"using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, including transportation and health technology,\" according to the company's financial filings. In Alphabet's annual filing last week, the company said the Other Bets segment recorded an operating loss last year of $7.5 billion, which included a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge at Waymo.In addition to DoorDash, Waymo is also paying users of Honk, an independent roadside assistance company, to close robotaxi doors. A recent Washington Post report said Honk users, who get paid to provide maintenance on Waymo vehicles, were offered up to $24 in Los Angeles for closing a door.On Thursday, Waymo began deploying its next-generation robotaxi as the company pushes to extend its lead in the U.S. Waymo currently offers its fully autonomous robotaxi service in six U.S. markets, with plans to expand to several more this year.WATCH: Waymo raises $16 billion at $126 billion valuation watch now",

It's the stock's worst day since 2022.Strong demand for artificial intelligence data centers has led to a global shortage of memory, which has caused costs to skyrocket for the component. Large orders for data center memory have limited production capacity for other devices, including smartphones.This has created uncertainty for a number of tech companies, including consumer electronics makers like Apple and Dell as well as chipmakers like Qualcomm, which cited the shortage when it issued weak guidance on Feb. 4. Now, Cisco is feeling the pinch. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins addressed memory price increases across the market on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Robbins said Cisco will raise prices, revise contracts and negotiate terms to account for the evolving component prices. \"In terms of memory, we're going to control what we can control,\" Cisco finance chief Mark Patterson said on the call.The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but shares dropped about 7% as Cisco issued a mediocre forecast.Product gross margin for the quarter was 66.4%, down 130 bps from the year prior, which Patterson said was \"primarily driven by negative impacts from mix and higher memory costs.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt salesFTC tells Tim Cook to look into reports Apple News is censoring conservativesAnthropic closes $30 billion funding round as cash keeps flowing into top AI startupsWaymo begins deploying next-gen Ojai robotaxis to extend its U.S. lead",

    "body": "watch nowThe Department of Homeland Security is barreling toward a shutdown starting this weekend after Senate Democrats and the White House on Thursday failed to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement restrictions.A bill already approved by the House of Representatives, which would fund DHS through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, failed on Thursday to clear a procedural hurdle in the Senate, meaning time will run out before a shutdown can be avoided.Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, shortly after that vote also objected to immediately considering what would have been the second two-week stopgap funding for DHS while negotiations continue.Congress went into a weeklong recess after Murphy's objection, making a shutdown set to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday.The looming shutdown comes as Democratic senators continue to negotiate directly with the White House and President Donald Trump on a deal that could unlock DHS funding. Democrats want new restrictions on immigration officers, citing the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in January by federal agents who were there to conduct immigration enforcement.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

The TSA shutdown could affect travelers going through airport security, especially if agents miss their paychecks in early March.\"DHS essential missions and functions will continue as they do during every shutdown,\" a DHS spokesperson told CNBC. \"However, during a shutdown, many employees will be forced to work without pay, putting strain on the frontline defenders of our nation.\"So far, Democrats and the White House appear far apart on their terms for a deal to restore full funding to DHS.\"Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said at a press conference after Thursday's vote.Schumer threw cold water on the White House's latest offer. \"Their proposal is not serious,\" Schumer said. He declined to detail the sticking points. Democrats are pushing for a series of changes at DHS. They want a requirement for agents to wear body cameras, a bar on agents wearing masks and a requirement for judicial warrants for arrests. The Democrats also want an end to \"roving patrols,\" a term they have used to describe the administration's dragnet immigration operations. A senior White House official said the judicial warrants are a \"particularly challenging aspect,\" according to MS Now. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration won't accept changes that affect its ability to deploy its immigration enforcement agenda.If a deal is reached, both chambers of Congress could come back from their recess and pass it. But it's far from clear that a deal will be clinched over the next week.And, many lawmakers are set to be in Germany then for the Munich Security Conference. \"If and when there's a breakthrough, we'll make sure people are here to vote on it,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",

    "body": "This aerial view shows the Taiwanese cargo ship Yang Ming sailing out of the Panama Canal on the Pacific side in Panama City on October 6, 2025.Martin Bernetti | Afp | Getty ImagesHong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings has threatened legal action against Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk after Panamanian authorities tapped the group to temporarily take over operations of two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal.In a statement on Thursday, CK Hutchison warned A.P. Moller-Maersk that \"any steps\" the Danish group or its subsidiary takes to operate the ports without its agreement will likely \"result in legal recourse.\" That's according to CNBC's translation of the Chinese statement.  The simmering dispute has become a geopolitical flashpoint between Washington and Beijing, with Panama caught in the crossfires. After U.S. President Donald Trump alleged last year that China was \"running the Panama Canal,\" CK Hutchison negotiated a $23 billion deal with a BlackRock-led consortium to sell its non-Chinese port subsidiaries. Beijing swiftly intervened, describing the sale as  \"kowtowing\" to American pressure and stalling the transaction.Tensions intensified last month when Panama's Supreme Court ruled that the concession held by a CK Hutchison subsidiary to operate the two ports was \"unconstitutional.\" The company pushed back, saying it \"strongly disagreed\" with the ruling and launched arbitration proceedings against Panama.CK Hutchison on Thursday also said it had notified Panama of the dispute under an investment protection treaty, saying it would pursue \"all available recourse including additional national and international legal proceedings.\" Read moreAPM Terminals, the Maersk subsidiary asked to take over the ports, reportedly said it was not party to the legal dispute and had only offered to step in temporarily \"to mitigate the risks that could affect essential services for regional and global trade.\"Maersk shares fell over 3% in Copenhagen on Thursday.  Who has the cards?The stakes around Panama ports have risen sharply this year. The Panama court's ruling was seen as a major victory for the U.S., given that the White House has made blocking China's influence over the global trade artery one of its top priorities. In its strongest rebuke yet, Beijing warned on Wednesday that the Central American country \"will inevitably pay a heavy price both politically and economically,\" unless it changes course. Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office called the court ruling \"logically flawed\" and \"utterly ridiculous.\" China also directed state firms to halt talks over new projects in Panama and asked shipping companies to consider rerouting cargo through other ports, Bloomberg reported last week. The standoff may prove more manageable for Washington than it appears, according to Reva Goujon, a director at advisory firm Rhodium Group. The U.S. retains significant leverage through its treaty with Panama, which could allow it to defend any intervention on national security grounds, she said. But Beijing has claimed a partial victory, by derailing Washington's initial plans to acquire CK Hutchison's global port holdings outright, Goujon said. China needs to make the U.S. \"clawback in Panama as difficult as possible to avoid setting a precedent,\" Goujon said, noting that Chinese state-owned shipping giant Cosco's Chancay port in Peru — a key infrastructure investment by Beijing in Latin America — is also in U.S. crosshairs. The U.S. has raised sovereignty concerns over the port of Chancay, a deep-water facility near Lima. In a post on X on Thursday, the U.S. State Department's bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said Peru could be \"powerless\" to oversee the critical port which was \"under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"  Prolonged legal battle? For CK Hutchison, the lawfare will likely end in vein, analysts and law experts told CNBC.   \"There's little CK Hutchison can do even with behind-the-scenes support from Beijing,\" Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors.Any legal claims — including wrongful interference with property — will ultimately hinge on whether CK Hutchison's port concession is considered \"live\" or formally terminated, said Shahla Ali, a professor specializing in arbitration laws at the University of Hong Kong. The duration of Maersk's control over the ports will also be scrutinized, said Ali, who views the recent legal notice as \"a deterrent\" to keep the door open for further negotiation.       The Panama canal — a crucial trade passage that links the Atlantic and Pacific – handles roughly 40% of all U.S. container traffic each year. CK Hutchison's subsidiary, Panama Ports Co., has operated them since 1997 and received a 25-year agreement renewal in 2021. The canal was built in the early 20th century by the U.S. which operated it for decades before handing full control to Panama in 1999. Analysts expected the dispute to drag on, potentially straining U.S.-China relations, already frayed by one year of tariff tensions, Beijing's tightened grip on rare earth exports, disputes over Taiwan and Washington's restrictions on tech exports. CK Hutchison said Thursday that the continued operation of the two ports \"depends solely on actions of the Panama Supreme Court and the Panamanian State,\" which it cannot control. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Environmental Protection Agency's decision to reverse its findings on the harms caused by greenhouse gases might look like a win for big gas-guzzling vehicles and a disaster for the U.S. electric vehicle market. But critics of the move and some industry analysts argue that the American auto industry can't afford to back away too much from fuel-efficient cars and EVs. The EPA is reconsidering a legal framework known as the endangerment finding for several reasons, but chief among them is its conclusion that the Clean Air Act of 1970 gave the agency the authority to regulate airborne toxins that pose a direct threat to human health, not greenhouse gases, which may indirectly cause harm through the effects of climate change. This finding helped formed the basis of subsequent fuel-efficiency targets, EV incentives and a host of other federal and state policies and programs meant to decarbonize transportation. The EPA's reversal is the latest move by the Trump administration and Congress to undo rules and incentives intended to steer automakers and buyers away from fuel-burning vehicles and toward low or zero emission vehicles — most notably EVs. Last year, Congress removed federal tax credits for EVs of up to $7,500 for a new car, or up to $4,000 for a used vehicle. Sales dropped dramatically in October, the month after the credits went away, according to Cox Automotive. President Donald Trump last year also signed three resolutions rescinding waivers the EPA had granted decades ago to states such as California, which enabled a host of air quality, climate change mitigation and emissions rules. The Zero Emission Vehicle credits program in California and other states were crucial revenue sources for Tesla as it grew from a tiny startup to one of the largest EV makers in the world. Some automakers, and the industry groups that represent them, have chafed at emissions regulations they consider too restrictive and too favorable to EVs, arguing that those vehicles aren't matching consumer demand. U.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive.\"We appreciate the work of President Trump and Administrator [Lee] Zeldin to address the imbalance between current emissions standards and customer choice,\" Ford Motor said in a statement sent to CNBC. \"Ford has consistently advocated for a single, stable national standard that aligns with customer choice, the market, societal benefit, and American job growth.\"CNBC reached out to the two other Detroit-based legacy automakers, Stellantis and General Motors, for comment. Stellantis did not respond in time for publication and GM referred CNBC to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the U.S. trade group representing both American and international automakers.The Alliance said Wednesday's action will \"correct some of the unachievable emissions regulations enacted under the previous administration.\"\"The auto industry in America remains focused on preserving vehicle choice for consumers, keeping the industry competitive, and staying on a long-term path of emissions reductions and cleaner vehicles,\" the Alliance added in a statement.The Alliance has in the past year criticized state and federal rules meant to bolster EV adoption. When the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed lessening Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, the Alliance welcomed the change. \"We're reviewing NHTSA's announcement, but we're glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,\" Alliance President and CEO John Bozzella said in a December statement. \"We've been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs.\"An aerial view of the Tesla Fremont Factory on January 29, 2026 in San Rafael, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesTesla, on the other hand, is one of the automakers opposed to the reconsideration of the endangerment finding. \"The Endangerment Finding — and the vehicle emissions standards which flow from it — have provided a stable regulatory platform for Tesla's extensive investments in product development and production,\" Tesla wrote in a letter to the EPA. \"Reversing the Endangerment Finding would also deprive consumers of choice and extensive economic benefits, have negative effects on human health, and further impact the integrated North American automotive sector.\"Clean transportation researchers and analysts have warned that abandoning fuel-efficiency goals and electric vehicles might be short-sighted, given the push for cleaner transportation options around the world.  All three Detroit automakers sell vehicles outside of the United States, and thus still need to reckon with stricter emissions regulations in other markets. In addition, the consumer case for EVs is growing ever stronger, said Alan Jenn, a professor at the University of California, Davis's Electric Vehicle Research Center. Battery prices have fallen and there are about 70 models in the U.S. market, compared with just a few about a decade ago, he said. \"Even despite this, almost kind of this war on EVs — getting rid of the subsidies, getting rid of the regulation — I think it's been pushed to a point where you're not going to see us turn totally around on EVs,\" Jenn said. \"A lot of that product is commercially viable, and I think it's going to continue to grow, albeit maybe a little more slowly now.\"Watch the video above to learn more.

    "body": "watch nowRivian Automotive on Thursday beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations and said it's targeting a significant increase in vehicle deliveries this year, but the automaker also cautioned that it will continue losing money as it launches its crucial R2 next-generation vehicle.Rivian's 2026 guidance includes increasing vehicle deliveries to between 62,000 and 67,000 units, which would be up by 47% to 59% compared with 2025. That increase is expected to be assisted by the launch of the R2 SUV during the second quarter.Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Thursday that the R2 is expected to be the \"majority of the volume\" of the business by the end of 2027, as it ramps up production at its sole factory in Normal, Illinois.The electric vehicle maker also said it expects adjusted pre-tax losses for 2026 of between $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion and capital expenditures between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion. That compares with nearly $2.1 billion in adjusted pre-tax losses and $1.7 billion in capital expenditures last year.Scaringe described 2025 to investors Thursday as a \"foundational year\" for Rivian, while saying 2026 will mark \"an inflection point\" for the company.Shares of Rivian were up more than 15% during after-hours trading Thursday after closing at $14, down roughly 5%.watch nowHere's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: 54 cents adjusted vs. a loss of 68 cents expectedRevenue: $1.29 billion vs. $1.26 billion expectedRivian's full-year 2025 revenue, including $1.7 billion during the fourth quarter, was up 8% compared with $4.97 billion in 2024.The company was able to achieve its first annual gross profit, which is closely watched by investors, of $144 million in 2025, including $120 million during the fourth quarter. That was driven by its software and services joint venture with Volkswagen offsetting $432 million in losses for its automotive business last year.This year's gross profit may not be as fruitful, with Rivian CFO Claire McDonough describing it as a \"transition year\" as it ramps up R2 production.Investors view gross profit as a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest and taxes.Rivian's net loss last year was $3.6 billion, an improvement from a loss of $4.75 billion in 2024. That includes an $804 million loss during the fourth quarter, accelerated by a decrease in earnings from the sale of regulatory credits, which was expected after changes by the Trump administration to federal fuel economy and emissions standards.Rivian ended the fourth quarter with $6.59 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $6.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.It's needed capital for Rivian. This year is a crucial one for the automaker as it attempts to deliver on promises of technological advancements and improved profitability with the R2. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.Rivian said the R2 is expected to initially be produced by one plant shift, followed by a second shift by the end of this year. The company said additional R2 details by model such as pricing, options and more will be available on March 12.Rivian has made important strides with its first-generation R1 pickup and SUV, but the market for such pricey EVs, which both start in the $70,000s, has slowed. It also continues to produce an all-electric delivery van, historically purchased by its largest shareholder, Amazon.",

    "body": "watch nowFamilies won't see relief from rising electricity prices anytime soon, as demand from artificial intelligence data centers soars while power supply grows slowly, according to Goldman Sachs.Electricity prices jumped 6.9% in 2025 year over year, more than double the headline inflation rate of 2.9%, Goldman analysts told clients in a research note published Wednesday. Prices will continue to rise through the end of the decade, as data centers make up 40% of electricity demand growth, the analysts said. This will lower disposable income, drag down consumer spending and slightly slow economic growth in the coming years, they said. Households will see electricity prices rise an additional 6% through 2027, the analysts said. Price inflation will then slow to 3% in 2028 on lower natural gas prices, they said. Consumer spending growth will fall 0.2% through 2027 and economic growth will slow 0.1% as a result, according to Goldman.The trajectory of electricity prices, however, will vary widely across the U.S. based on different regional market structures and what regulatory choices are made, the bank said. \"The income and spending drags will likely be larger for lower-income households because electricity accounts for a greater share of their spending,\" Goldman analyst Manuel Abecasis said. Households in regions with more data centers will also take a bigger hit, he said. Higher electricity prices will increase core inflation by 0.1% through 2027 and by 0.05% in 2028 as businesses pass on higher costs to consumers, the Goldman analysts said. watch nowThe rapid growth of data centers is colliding with a constrained electricity supply as regulatory barriers as well as labor and material shortages make it difficult to build new power plants, the analysts said. The tight supply-demand balance will push up wholesale electricity prices, particularly in California, the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, they said. Utilities will spend more on infrastructure to meet the demand and that will also be passed on to consumers, they said. The role that the AI industry is playing in electricity price inflation has turned into a major political flashpoint ahead of the midterm elections this November. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won elections for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, in 2025 in part on promising to bring utility bills under control. President Donald Trump has embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth, but he  increasingly sees electricity prices as a threat to the Republican Party's political fortunes. Trump secured a promise from Microsoft in January that it will not allow its data centers to drive up prices.The White House also signed a pact with several states last month that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants in the nation's largest electric grid, PJM Interconnection. Data centers are playing a particularly disruptive role in the PJM market, which covers 13 states, primarily across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The cost to secure power supplies in PJM has exploded in recent years, with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. These costs get passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.",

    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "President Donald Trump and his administration will begin imposing new limits for federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.Undergraduate borrowers will have the same current limit of up to $7,500 a year for dependent students, depending on their class year. But graduate and professional students will see new limits of up to $20,500 per year ($100,000 total) for graduate studies and $50,000 a year ($200,000 total) for professional programs. Graduate PLUS loans, which previously allowed students to borrow up to their total cost of attendance, will be eliminated.According to the proposed regulation, a professional degree \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"The Department of Education has named 11 degree fields that meet the requirements to be considered professional, and thus eligible for higher loan limits under the new rules: Pharmacy (Pharm. D.)Dentistry doctorate (D.D.S. or D.M.S.)Veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.)Law (L.L.B. or J.D.)Medicine (M.D.)Optometry (O.D.)Osteopathic medicine (D.O.)Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.)Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.)Clinical psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.)The addition of clinical psychology came out of the department's recent negotiated rulemaking session where stakeholders debated the loan limit rule and how it should be applied.The department also said programs in at least 44 other fields could qualify if they meet certain criteria, including giving students a \"level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree,\" generally resulting in a doctoral level degree and requiring professional licensure to begin practice. Potentially eligible programs include a number of other pharmacy degrees, clinical counseling and theological studies. Institutions are responsible for determining whether a program meets the requirements to be considered a professional degree or not, says Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Professional organizations respondSome professional organizations have expressed concern over the list of degrees eligible for the $200,000 aggregate federal loan limit and the Department of Education's definition of professional programs.\"Despite broad recognition of the complexity, rigor, and necessity of post-baccalaureate nursing education, the Department's proposal defines professional programs so narrowly that nursing, the nation's largest healthcare profession, remains excluded,\" The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a press release on Nov. 7. \"Should this proposal be finalized, the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.\"\"Declassifying the [Master of Social Work] and [Doctorate of Social Work] degrees will reduce access to affordable social work education, thereby increasing reliance on high-interest private loans,\" the National Association of Social Workers' Florida chapter said in a press release on Nov. 20.In a fact sheet released on Nov. 24, the Department of Education said, \"The definition of a 'professional degree' is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.\"The intention behind the loan limits is to discourage borrowers from taking on more debt than they will be able to handle and to encourage institutions to rein in tuition costs, the department said. The loan limit regulation is not final, however. The Department of Education will publish the regulation in its current form in the federal register in the coming months where the public will have the opportunity to give feedback before it becomes final.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Boaz Weinstein is calling for the removal of the entire board of a tech-focused fund managed by Baillie Gifford, in a bid to reverse what the activist investor sees as \"unprecedented\" value destruction.In a letter to the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust's board on Thursday, Weinstein — whose activist investment firm Saba Capital owns around 30% of shares in the trust — said the board has \"objectively and categorically failed\" to deliver the performance expected by shareholders.EWIT's portfolio comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on tech innovation and transformation, that target \"significant disruptive growth potential,\" according to the London-listed Baillie Gifford's website. Its holdings include Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which makes up 8.4% of its portfolio.Weinstein said EWIT's net asset value is down 30.8% over the past five years, while its share price return has fallen 35%, having \"massively underperformed\" its self-selected benchmark, the FTSE All-Share Index, which is up 71.4% over the same period.That means the company's NAV return and share price performance ultimately lag the benchmark by more than 100% over the five-year period, Saba noted in the letter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"The magnitude of this value destruction is unprecedented among peer U.K. equity investment trusts over this period,\" Weinstein wrote.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, chair of EWIT, expressed disappointment with Saba's open letter.He said EWIT's benchmark is the S&P Global Small Cap Index — not the FTSE All-Share Index cited in Weinstein's letter.\"It makes little sense to judge a global small-cap trust against a U.K. all-cap benchmark,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement, adding that EWIT's NAV total return has been 17.5% to date, ahead of the S&P Global Small Cap Index's 4.8%. Saba Capital's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this point.The trust's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31. Weinstein is calling for a general meeting to appoint a new board composed solely of \"qualified, independent directors… committed to delivering long-term value for all shareholders.\"\"We remain profoundly frustrated by the board's prolonged inertia,\" the activist investor wrote in the letter on Thursday. \"We do not have faith in the current Board's ability to implement the necessary strategic changes.\"Simpson-Dent said EWIT's board will continue to seek \"constructive dialog\" with Weinstein toward an \"equitable and holistic\" solution, including return of capital. But he warned: \"While we are open to discuss Board composition with Saba, we would strongly reject any proposal to replace the entire Board and the ambiguity that would follow.\"He added: \"The company's actions over the last year have supported a tightly managed discount, currently 5.6%, significantly narrower than the Global Smaller Companies peer group weighted average discount of 10.9%.\"The move follows an earlier attempt by Saba last year to shake up the EWI trust's board, a bid which ultimately failed to win investor support.Weinstein — whose New York-based $6 billion hedge fund trades credit relative value opportunities — has built a number of positions across the U.K. investment trust space lately. Outlining two new bets at the annual Sohn London investment conference last week, he said there is \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust sector where discounts have widened sharply.",

    "body": "The Workday Inc. pop-up pavilion ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2025.Hollie Adams | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of software maker Workday slid nearly 8% on Wednesday as analysts lowered their price targets, citing a lack of a upside after the company revised its full-year subscription revenue forecast.Many software stocks have been under pressure in 2025 as commentators have worried that generative artificial intelligence tools that can quickly write lines of code might pose risks to incumbents. This year, Workday has announced the launch of several AI agents and expanded its offerings through startup acquisitions. Earlier this month, Workday completed the $1.1 billion purchase of AI and learning software company Sana.Despite those moves, Workday's third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress Wall Street. The company called for $8.83 billion in subscription revenue for the fiscal year that will end in January 2026, implying 14.4% growth, but the figure was up just $13 million from the company's guidance in August. The new number includes contributions from Sana and a contract with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Workday finance chief Zane Rowe told analysts on a conference call.\"Investors were likely looking for more of a beat-and-raise quarter,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Matt VanVliet and Mason Marion wrote in a note to clients. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday stock. The new number, they wrote, \"borders on a slight guide down.\" The analysts held their 12-month price target on Workday stock at $280.Stifel, with a hold rating on the stock, lowered its Workday target to $235 from $255.\"It does not appear that the underlying momentum of the business is showing any signs of stabilization,\" Stifel's Brad Reback and Robert Galvin wrote in a note. Reback and Galvin said Workday implied that growth from its 12-month subscription revenue backlog will continue to slow when removing impact from acquisitions. They expect the trend to continue even as customers sign up for Workday's AI products, they wrote.The outcome was \"like turkey without the gravy,\" Evercore analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, wrote in the title of their note. Analysts at RBC, which also has the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday shares, lowered their price target to $320 from $340. Despite the mixed guidance, they wrote in a note to clients, results for the fiscal third quarter did exceed consensus. Plus, AI products contributed over 1.5 percentage points of annualized revenue growth, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on Tuesday's conference call. '\"We remain encouraged by early AI momentum,\" the RBC analysts wrote.WATCH: AI will drive the market higher in 2026, says Citizens' Mark Lehmannwatch now",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) Heads of State Council at the Yntymak Ordo (Palace of Unity) presidential residence in Bishkek on November 27, 2025. Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a draft peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework to build upon.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. On Thursday, Putin praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stops once Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces will achieve their objectives by force, he added.Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India.

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Firefighters were still working to contain the blaze in the remaining areas.Officials said the blaze may have started on a section of bamboo scaffolding encasing the complex, then spread to other buildings through the wooden poles and protective netting — prompting public scrutiny of the city's housing standards.  Hong Kong's police pointed to a \"grossly negligent\" construction company for using \"highly inflammable\" foam material, protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not have met fire standards. Three men from the construction company have been arrested on suspicion of \"manslaughter.\"  Volunteers give out food to residents after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong's Tai Po district on Nov. 27, 2025.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

Puma forecast slower profit growth as new Chief Executive Officer Arne Freundt confronts excess inventory and higher costs for marketing sneakers and apparel. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPuma shares jumped as much as 16% early Thursday following a report that China's Anta Sports is among a number of firms looking to buy the struggling German athletic brand.Puma is in the middle of what is calls a \"reset,\" as sales growth has dramatically dropped after a revenue bump during Covid-19. Post-pandemic, however, the brand has wrestled with fading customer resonance with customers and resulting high inventories.Earlier this month, shares hit their lowest level in more than 10 years, while year-to-date losses amount to more than 50% amid an increasingly competitive sportswear market and tariffs hitting customer sentiment. The company is now reportedly considering a buy-out, according to a report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources. Hong Kong-listed Anta Sports is said to weigh a potential bid for the sportswear maker, the outlet reported. Puma declined to comment and Anta Sports didn't immediately to respond to a CNBC request for comment.For Anta, acquiring Puma could be a gateway to the Western world, said Metzler analyst Felix Dennl, noting the Chinese company's strong track record in turning around underperforming assets. \"On the one hand, Anta already has broad-based international market exposure via its stake in Amer Group, hence the additional value add from Puma is expected to add to the portfolio is not completely clear,\" he added.Puma may also attract interest from Chinese apparel firm Li Ning and Japan's Asics Corp, the Bloomberg report said. \"As of now, the company has not engaged in any substantive negotiations or evaluations regarding the transaction mentioned in the news,\" Li Ning said in an emailed statement. Asics didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Puma's Frankfurt-listed shares were up 13.7% by 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET).Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPuma shares year-to-datePuma CEO Arthur Hoeld, who was appointed on July 1, is tasked with reviving the ailing brand. His turnaround plan involves cutting jobs, narrowing its product range, and improving marketing operations.\"At the end of July, we stated that 2025 would be a year of reset,\" Hoeld said in a statement on Oct. 30. \"Since then, we have taken important steps to clean up PUMA's distribution, improve our cash management and reset our operational expenses. By expanding our cost efficiency programme, we are moving quickly to address challenges and make the business more efficient and resilient.\"The company also said it is aiming to establish itself as a \"Top 3 global sports brand,\" as it reported quarterly sales that fell on a double digit basis. Puma acknowledged that key challenges included a muted brand momentum, U.S. tariffs, and high inventory levels.In July, the company cut its 2025 guidance, saying its now expecting a sales decline at a low double-digit percentage rate, from a previous guide of sales growth at a low- to mid-single digit percentage rate. It also said it expects to post an operating profit loss in 2025 — a huge swing from the previously expected profit of between 445 million euros ($516 million) and 525 million euros — due to the impact of tariffs. watch nowPuma's biggest shareholder is currently Artemis which holds a 29% stake in the company. Artemis — the holding company of France's billionaire Pinault family as well as the largest shareholder of Gucci-owner Kering — has been on a spending spree and has seen its debt balloon. Artemis' valuation expectations for Puma may be a major hurdle to any transaction involving the athletic brand, Bloomberg reported.-- Karen Gilchrist contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump returns to the White House on Marine One in Washington, D.C., on November 22, 2025.Allison Robbert | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesA judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case \"dismissed in its entirety,\" draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"\"In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years,\" Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.Fulton County Sheriff's OfficeTrump celebrated the ruling later Wednesday, writing in a lengthy Truth Social post that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed.\"\"This case should never have been brought,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement. \"A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"The case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v. Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.Alex Slitz-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.By that time, Willis was facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was disqualified from the case in December 2024.The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

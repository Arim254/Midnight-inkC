    "body": "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during an event in Turin, Italy, Nov. 25, 2025.Daniele Mascolo | ReutersDETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa views 2026 as an execution year for the embattled maker of Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles in the U.S. after years of market share declines.Filosa has been undertaking a turnaround plan since he was named CEO in May. So far, his plans have included prioritizing the company's Jeep and Ram brands in the U.S. as well as undoing many decisions his predecessor Carlos Tavares made to focus on all-electric vehicles.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa, wearing a Jeep vest over a white button-down shirt, said this year is a \"first step\" in remaking the company, which was formed five years ago through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA Groupe.He declined to discuss specifics, adding that his executive team will lay out a detailed future strategy for the automaker at a capital markets day in the first half of this year.Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also include Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.Filosa said he does believe that the company wants \"to stay together\" following some Wall Street speculation in recent years that it would be better to sell off assets or brands. \"We are building a culture,\" Filosa said.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come next week during a meeting with more than 200 company executives that will focus on the company's capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.\"We are a global company with strong regional roots,\" Filosa said, referring to one of three guiding cultural principles he's attempting to instill in the company. The others are being customer focused and working together.Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, falling from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.",

    "body": "An entrance to the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store in New York on Jan. 14, 2026, after the company filed for bankruptcy protection.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersFor more than a decade, the former executive chairman of Saks Global dreamed of adding Neiman Marcus to his collection of legacy department stores, believing the combined entities would create a luxury powerhouse strong enough to defy changes dragging down the industry.Instead, Richard Baker's $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus in 2024 ultimately plunged the company into bankruptcy just over a year after the transaction closed. From the very start, the company was struggling to pay its bills — which led to angry vendors and little room for error. In a Wednesday declaration filed in Houston's bankruptcy court hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, chief restructuring officer Mark Weinsten wrote that the deal led to \"immediate liquidity challenges\" and created an \"unsustainable\" capital structure.Mickey Chadha, Moody's Ratings vice president of corporate finance, called it a \"recipe for disaster.\"\"You had the two companies that weren't doing great, and then you combine the two companies and put on a large amount of debt,\" said Chadha. \"It was an unsustainable capital structure right from the beginning.\"The deal, funded with $2.2 billion in junk bonds, brought an influx of liquidity. But once the transaction closed and both companies paid debts related to the agreement, there wasn't enough money left over to pay Saks' vendors. With bills running late, vendors were less willing to send Saks inventory. Soon, the retailer lacked an adequate assortment to drive sales, leading the situation to deteriorate.\"This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet. This classic vicious spiral put the business in an unsustainable position,\" retail analyst Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, wrote in an emailed note. \"While the previous management team always presented the merger as an opportunity to create a luxury powerhouse, behind the glossy facade the deal was an entanglement of complex financial engineering that made it impossible for the group to execute their stated vision.\" With Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue under the new Saks Global umbrella, the company expected to see $600 million in run-rate synergies over the five years after the deal closed, Weinsten said. But soon after the transaction closed, Saks realized integrating Neiman Marcus was going to be more difficult, and costly, than expected. Just ahead of last year's critical holiday shopping season, Saks was \"affected by one-time merchandising system integration issues,\" which disrupted inventory flows at Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman at a time when sales and inventory were already at a \"seasonal low point,\" Weinsten wrote. Saks's borrowing was asset based, meaning loans were backed by its inventory. Once the company had less merchandise on hand, Saks could not borrow as much as it needed to. With less liquidity, it couldn't pay vendors according to the terms they agreed upon. Soon, $244 million in \"catch-up payments\" Saks had scrounged up to pay its vendors was \"negated,\" and once again the company was struggling to stock its shelves with the assortment its wealthy customers had come to expect, Weinsten said. By the end of the second fiscal quarter on Aug. 2, inventory was 9% below the previous year's levels, and it had over $550 million less in inventory receipts than it previously expected. That further reduced its liquidity under the terms of its asset-based loan. It spelled trouble for the key holiday season because Saks couldn't do what a retailer always needs to do to remain competitive: \"chase\" inventory so it had in-demand and on-trend items available during the busiest time of the year. \"You can't really sustain that much debt just on synergies,\" said Chadha. \"You have to grow the top line, increase your sales and increase profitability in order to sustain that much amount of debt.\" Four months after Saks secured new financing, it missed an interest payment to bondholders at the end of December. Two weeks later, it was bankrupt. 'Not a declining brick-and-mortar business'In Weinsten's declaration to the court, he made it clear it was Saks' liquidity challenges, and its subsequent issues with vendors, that plunged it into bankruptcy — not larger issues related to the luxury goods market or the decline of department stores. \"[Saks] is not a declining brick-and-mortar business,\" Weinsten wrote. \"There are strong indications that the Debtors' most lucrative customers are continuing to spend through their retail channels … in that respect, the constraints faced by the Company are not driven by declining demand; where product is available, performance has remained robust.\" He said the company does not need to make significant investments in marketing or capital expenditures to improve sales trends. Also, the synergies it expected to achieve through its merger with Neiman Marcus are starting to materialize more quickly.  By the end of its current fiscal year 2025, Saks had predicted run-rate synergies of approximately $150 million, but it's now expecting that number to grow to $300 million. It's seeing strong retention rates with its top customers and positive sales when inventory is in stock. \"This indicates that the Company's challenges are tied to inventory availability and vendor confidence,\" Weinsten said. \"Not underlying demand for luxury goods.\" Through its restructuring plan, which is subject to court approval, Saks has secured $1.75 billion in new financing and has pledged to make \"go-forward\" payments to vendors, honor all customer programs and continue staff payroll and benefits. A portion of the funds, $500 million, will be available to the company after it emerges from bankruptcy, which it said it expects to do later this year.Whether it'll be able to win back its vendors and get the business back to growth will fall on the company's new CEO, former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck. While the company's executives assert conditions are strong for a rebound as long as the company replenishes its balance sheet, department stores aren't what they used to be. Luxury brands have their own websites and stores and are no longer as reliant on wholesalers like Saks and Neiman Marcus as they once were. \"They're going to have to do something drastic, right? They can't survive with this financing, just as is … because just filing is not going to change what Saks really does. It's not going to get people into the door to buy more stuff,\" said Chadha. \"You're going to have to change the overall operation, so it's going to take a while. It's an uphill battle. They're not in the best space. It's a department store, as it is.\" ",

    "body": "TSMC offices in San Jose, California, on April 18, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a 35% increase in fourth-quarter profit, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips remained strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 1.046 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($33.73 billion), vs. NT$1.034 trillion expectedNet income: NT$505.74 billion, vs. NT$478.37 billion expectedThe world's largest contract chipmaker has now posted year-over-year profit growth for eight consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, TSMC's revenue in the December quarter rose by 20.5% from a year ago to surpass NT$1 trillion, also beating forecasts.In an earnings call, TSMC executives guided revenue for the current quarter to hit between $34.6 billion and $35.8 billion, up 4% sequentially, or up 38% year-over-year at the midpoint. \"We expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading edge process technologies,\" said TSMC's Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang during an earnings call, adding that the company's profit margins have been increasing. TSMC, Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, has benefited greatly from the proliferation of artificial intelligence, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and AMD. Advanced chips The company's high-performance computing division, which includes artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the October-December quarter at 55%. Demand from smartphones made up 32% of sales.TSMC said advanced chips measuring 7-nanometer or smaller made up 77% of total wafer revenue during the quarter. For full-year 2025, those chips made up 74% of revenue, up from 69% in 2024.In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes indicate more compact transistor designs, allowing faster processing speeds and greater energy efficiency. The company is looking to further ramp up its cutting-edge 2 nm offerings this year, after rolling out mass production last quarter. With TSMC further leaning into its advanced products, it said that its capital expenditure was expected to reach between $52 billion and $56 billion in 2026, as compared to $40.9 billion in 2025. \"The demand for AI remains very strong, driving overall chip demand across the entire server industry,\" Counterpoint Research senior analyst Jake Lai told CNBC, predicting that 2026 will be another \"breakout year\" for AI server demand. \"With TSMC's ongoing 2nm capacity expansion and new production contributing to revenue, along with continuous expansion of advanced packaging... TSMC is expected to maintain strong performance in 2026,\" Lai said. However, he added that chip demand tied to consumer electronics such as smartphones and PCs could be affected by the ongoing memory shortage and price hikes.During the earnings call on Thursday, TSMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei acknowledged the memory shortage but argued that TSMC is focused on high-end smartphones, which are less sensitive to the memory prices. However, Wei flagged global tariff policies as a potential risk factor headed into 2026. Global expansion TSMC has been expanding globally in recent years, with major projects underway in Japan, Europe, and Arizona, where it is accelerating capacity expansion.Chief Executive C.C. Wei said Thursday that the company recently purchased additional land in Arizona to support new facilities. \"We are going to expand many fabs over there, and this gigafab cluster can help us to improve the productivity, to lower the cost and to serve our customers in the U.S. better,\" he added. While these expansions could help lessen the impact of global tariffs in markets such as the U.S., the company has also warned that overseas plants will operate at diluted margins compared to those in Taiwan.

China's State Administration for Market Regulation late Wednesday said it was investigating Trip.com due to \"suspected abuse of its dominant market position and monopolistic practices,\" according to a CNBC translation of the statement in Mandarin.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrip.com is the largest online travel provider in Asia by market cap, and one of the biggest globally. The company has stakes in UK flight aggregator Skyscanner, Indian travel company MakeMyTrip, as well as several Chinese travel providers. Trip.com said in a statement it would \"actively cooperate\" with the investigation, and added its business operations were functioning as usual.The case could have long term ramifications for the company, according to Morningstar senior equity analyst Kai Wang. Wang said that \"multiple local tourism associations have complained that Trip.com is committing the same violations as the other two platforms, where it is forcing local merchants to sign exclusive agreements with the platform.\" Trip.com will then increase commissions from the merchants after these agreements are signed.Citing previous high-profile antitrust cases involving Alibaba and Meituan, as well as past government warnings, Wang said that Trip.com could incur a \"hefty fine.\" SAMR investigated Chinese tech giant in Alibaba in 2021, fining the firm a record 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) after it was found guilty of monopolistic practices. \"This is not the first time Trip.com has run afoul with the government for consumer violations, as the company was fined for forced bundling of value-added services back in 2017. This could also infuriate the government even more given its repeat offender status,\" he added.The probe into Trip.com comes as Chinese tourism is expected to surge this year, with travel marketing and technology firm China Trading Desk estimating that mainland Chinese travelers are expected to take about 165 million to 175 million cross-border trips in 2026, up from an estimated 155 million last year. The Chinese New Year holiday, which sees hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns, will be observed between Feb. 15 and Feb. 23.Travel consultancy firm Dragon Trail International said that in 2025, 501 million Chinese traveled domestically during the Chinese New Year holiday period, a 5.9% year-on-year increase. Tourism spending during the period reached 6.77 billion yuan, a 7% increase. ",

    "body": "Oil prices fell 3% on Thursday after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump calmed fears that an American strike on Iran could be imminent. Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, dipped by 2.8%, or $1.87, to settle at $64.63 a barrel. Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude lost $1.79, or 2.9%, to trade at $60.23 a barrel.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude priceSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had been informed by \"very important sources\" in Iran that \"the killing has stopped.\"\"There's no plans for executions, I've been told that on good authority,\" he said, adding that the White House would watch how the situation unfolds. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed after mass unrest in Iran was met with a violent crackdown by the Islamic Republic's security forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if civilians are killed or executed by the state. Oil prices jumped on Tuesday after Trump canceled meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that \"help is on its way,\" and extended gains on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a U.S. strike on the country was looming. Those fears were fueled by a report from news agency Reuters that some personnel had been directed to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening. The BBC also reported that some British personnel were being moved out of the base. On Tuesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory to American citizens to leave Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey. \"Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help,\" the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran said. \"If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items.\"In a note on Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said Trump's comments about the killing in Iran stopping had been taken by markets as \"a signal that the U.S. might hold off on a potential military response.\"\"[But] there's clearly lingering caution, not least given the unexpected timing of U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025,\" he noted. \"Brent crude is still clearly above its lows below $60/bbl last week, but Trump's comments had a clear impact.\"\"Bear in mind as well that Iran is a more significant oil producer than Venezuela, producing 4% of the world's total in 2023, so developments there have the potential for wider spillovers in the oil market,\" Reid added.",

The feature, called Personal Intelligence, is available for personal accounts, Google said in a blog post Wednesday. \"Whether it's connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched or finding nuance in your photo library, Gemini now understands context without being told where to look,\" Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and the Gemini app, wrote in the post. It's Google's latest attempt to build more reasoning AI capabilities within its Gemini app and lure users as the company goes head-to-head with OpenAI and others in the increasingly competitive generative AI market. While Gemini could already retrieve information from Google apps, the company said Wednesday that Gemini 3 can now \"reason across your data to surface proactive insights.\"The new feature will compete with Apple Intelligence, Apple's personal AI system that integrates apps to help with writing, image creation and understanding context. Apple said Monday it chose Google to power  its AI features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. Personal Intelligence will first be available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S., the company said, and will be added to Google's search tool \"AI Mode\" in the future. The feature will be off by default, Google said. Woodward, who has launched successful products in Gemini in the past year, warned that the beta version of the new feature hasn't eliminated mistakes, and is asking users to give feedback. \"Gemini may also struggle with timing or nuance, particularly regarding relationship changes, like divorces, or your various interests,\" he wrote. For sensitive topics like health, \"Gemini aims to avoid making proactive assumptions\" but \"will discuss this data with you if you ask,\" Woodward added.Woodward also said the company doesn't train its AI models \"directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library\" but does utilize \"limited info, like specific prompts in Gemini and the model's responses, to improve functionality over time.\"WATCH: Google unveils 'Gemini 3 Flash' AI model focused on speed and costwatch now",

    "body": "The Toyota Industries Corp. logo at the company's Nagakusa plant in Obu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of forklift manufacturer Toyota Industries jumped to a record high on Thursday, a day after Toyota Motor sweetened the tender offer price for buying out the carmaker by more than 15% to over $35 billion.Shares of Toyota Industries rose almost 6% to 19,080 yen, soaring past the revised offer price, signaling investors likely expect an even better deal. Shares of Toyota Motor, the world's largest carmaker by sales, advanced over 2%.Toyota Motor said late Wednesday it had raised the buyout offer for the group company to 18,800 yen ($118.11) per share, from 16,300 yen apiece announced in June last year, advancing plans to take the company private. Last year, Toyota Motor had sought to acquire Japan's largest corporate group for 4.7 trillion yen. The deal included 1 billion yen from chair Akio Toyoda, and Toyota Motor's investment of about 700 billion yen in non-voting preferred shares.In December, Toyota Industries said it had asked for a higher price, citing concerns that the deal's chances of success were limited.\"While the revised offer represents an all-time high, it remains arguably light,\" said Arun George, a global equity research analyst on SmartKarma.It comes in below the middle of the valuation range set out by the independent adviser, suggesting the company may still be undervalued, he said.Toyota Industries, which founded Toyota Motor, produces a range of products including forklifts, engines, electronic components, and stamping dies.\"I expect there to be some interesting fireworks on this deal. It is the biggest mis-priced takeover in Japan for quite a while. To be clear I expect activist action,\" said Travis Lundy, an independent analyst, adding that he expects activists to demand a higher price or try to block the deal.In its latest sales and production report, Toyota Motor's global output slid 5.5% to 821,723 units in November,  marking the first year-on-year decline in six months. Global sales also fell 2.2% year-on-year, with the company reporting that sales in China fell after the country scaled back on purchase subsidies in certain regions.The automaker flagged a substantial hit from U.S. tariffs, projecting a 1.45 trillion yen (over $9 billion) impact for its financial year ending March. Toyota Motor last November announced it would invest $912 million across U.S. manufacturing facilities in five Southern states, part of a broader plan to spend up to $10 billion in the U.S. by 2030.",

    "body": "Mark Mason, then CEO of Citi Private Bank, speaks during the Global Wealth Management Summit in New York, June 17, 2014.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersThe biggest U.S. banks show no sign of capitulating to President Donald Trump's mandate to slash credit card interest rates, setting up a confrontation just as the president is expected to take the world stage next week at Davos.Executives at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned this week that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has directed should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would or could support,\" Citigroup CFO Mark Mason told reporters on Wednesday.It would \"restrict access to credit to those who need it the most and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy,\" he said.On Tuesday, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum indicated that the industry could defend itself in the courts if needed, saying \"everything's on the table\" in terms of a response. Trump, keen to address voters' concerns over affordability ahead of midterm elections this year, began his broadside against banks in a late-Friday social media post by alleging that the industry was ripping off credit card borrowers. In media interviews and follow up posts, Trump has doubled down on his push and endorsed a separate bill that takes aim at the swipe fees paid by merchants.But five days after the original threat, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC that they have yet to receive any formal or written guidance from the Trump administration about the policy.That gives some of them hope that the administration isn't serious about pursuing the interest rate cap, according to industry insiders, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.Deal time?While Trump has said banks that don't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" there is currently no U.S. law capping card rates. A bill introduced last year that would cap rates at 10% for five years has stalled in Congress.\"We are legally compliant right now,\" said one person with knowledge of a large card issuer's operations.Barring legislation, which is not likely, the industry will either dodge the caps entirely or be forced to offer concessions, similar to how Trump dealt with the pharmaceutical industry, Wolfe Research analysts led by Tobin Marcus said Tuesday in a note.\"We continue to view the drugmakers as the case study in how this kind of dealmaking-under-threat could go,\" Marcus said. \"In that case, Trump had enough leverage to secure some new pricing commitments, but not enough to extract truly painful commitments.\"watch nowThe financial sector is keenly focused on two upcoming events for a sense of how the credit card battle will unfold, sources tell CNBC.The first is Senate meetings this month where bills being worked on could see the addition of Trump's rate cap or the push to limit interchange fees. But that path is murky, given that several Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have already indicated they wouldn't support price controls on credit cards.The other looming date is next Wednesday, the day after Trump's Jan. 20 deadline. That's when Trump will address leaders from the corporate and political realms at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CEOs including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon are also scheduled to attend.At last year's Davos conference, Trump surprised Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan by accusing him and Dimon of discriminating against conservatives when it comes to access to bank accounts.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump looks on before signing a bill in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 14, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his administration will approve China sales of Nvidia's H200 chip for artificial intelligence, but the U.S. government will take 25% of sales, one day after formal regulations were published by the U.S. government. Unlike Nvidia's previous China-targeted chip, the H20, the H200 is a version of the company's Hopper generation that is also sold in the U.S. and in other markets. The H200 was not specifically designed and slowed down for export. Trump pointed out in remarks on Wednesday that the H200's performance has been exceeded by two generations of Nvidia chips currently in production, naming Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips. \"It's not the highest level, but it's a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them and we're going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically,\" Trump said. Trump initially announced the approval of H200 chips and the 25% government cut a month ago.Previously, Nvidia said the Chinese market could be worth $50 billion per year. \"We're allowing them to do it, but the United States is getting 25% of the chips, in terms of the dollar value,\" Trump said. In a filing published on Tuesday, the Department of Commerce said that the rule change had some requirements, including that the exporter certifies that there is sufficient supply of the H200 chips in the U.S., and that the chips won't take global foundry capacity needed for more advanced AI chips headed for the U.S. Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseThe government said that the customers for the chips would have to have sufficient security procedures, and that the chips will need to undergo independent, third-party testing in the U.S. to confirm their specifications before shipping out. Shipments of the chips to China would be capped at 50% the total product shipped to U.S. customers. The filing also mentions AMD's MI325X chip. \"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\"The Administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors on U.S. entity lists — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial business, supporting real jobs for real Americans,\" the spokesperson continued. Last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that the company is seeing \"very high\" interest in its H200 chip from China customers, and that the company had started producing the chip again. ″We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas.It's unclear whether Chinese regulators will approve the import of the Nvidia chips as the country aims to promote home-grown but inferior AI chips for self-sufficiency. Huang said last week that he isn't expecting an announcement from China. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Last year, Huang provided a two-year forecast for AI chip sales of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Any H200 sales to China would be in addition to that forecast, he said last week. The White House said on Wednesday that it had also imposed a 25% tariff of imports on some chips like the H200, which have to be imported to the U.S. to be tested before they are shipped to China.watch now",

Anushree Fadnavis | ReutersAmazon launched its \"sovereign cloud\" offering in Europe on Thursday in a move designed to keep it among the leading players in the region even as more stringent regulations for tech giants are enforced.The term sovereign cloud broadly relates to cloud computing services where the data is stored, handled and not moved out of a specific jurisdiction. The European Union (EU) has pushed for companies operating in the bloc to be compliant with its various data and privacy regulations, as concerns have risen about the dominance of U.S. tech giants in the cloud space and potential access to European citizens' data.The Amazon Web Services (AWS) European Sovereign Cloud, based in Brandenburg, Germany, and first announced in 2023, is a new concept. Amazon said in a press release on Thursday that the cloud is \"physically and logically separate\" from other AWS regions. To do this, Amazon has created a new parent company for the sovereign cloud that will be locally controlled in the European Union (EU) and run by EU citizens. watch nowStéphane Israël will lead the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Stefan Hoechbauer, who is vice president of AWS global sales for Germany and Europe Central, has been appointed as a managing director. AWS also announced five new members of an advisory board for the sovereign cloud, three of which are Amazon employees.AWS said the sovereign cloud has \"no critical dependencies on non-EU infrastructure\" and it can continue to operate in the event of a communications disruption with the rest of the world. Under \"extreme circumstances, authorised AWS employees of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, who are EU residents, will have independent access to a replica of the source code needed to maintain the AWS European Sovereign Cloud services,\" the company said.For the past few years, European politicians and regulators have grown concerned about the dominance of U.S. tech firms over critical technology infrastructure. Despite the EU pushing for regional companies to grow their businesses, AWS, Microsoft and Google account for 70% of the cloud computing market in the region, according to Synergy Research Group. Even as AWS pushes its sovereign cloud, European regulators are currently investigating cloud computing services from Amazon and Microsoft under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the power of Big Tech. In 2024, Amazon said it would invest 7.8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud in Germany through 2040. On Thursday, Amazon said it would expand the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal.",

    "body": "The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday it will pause issuing immigrant visas to citizens of 75 countries over concerns that they may rely on public assistance in the future.In a post on X, the U.S. government said immigrants from the list of countries \"take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.\" The list, which includes U.S. allies and adversaries, alongside several top destinations for American travelers, was later posted on U.S. State Department's website.

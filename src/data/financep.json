    "body": "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, left, and Kevin Warsh, former governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve.ReutersKevin Warsh has surged ahead of Kevin Hassett in prediction markets betting on who President Donald Trump will nominate as the next chair of the Federal Reserve, as doubts grow inside Trump's orbit about Hassett's candidacy.On Kalshi, traders on Monday marked Warsh as the narrow favorite to replace Jerome Powell, assigning him roughly a 46% chance of nomination, compared with about 39% for Hassett. Just last week, Hassett's odds were as high as 77%, and Warsh's chance was as low as 10%.The shift follows fresh pushback against Hassett from high-level figures with direct access to the president, according to people familiar with the matter. Those advisers have raised concerns that Hassett, currently director of the National Economic Council, is seen as too close to Trump. The resistance may help explain a bout of uncertainty in the process earlier this month, when interviews with prospective candidates were abruptly canceled in early December. At least in Warsh's case, those interviews were later put back on the calendar and held last week, the people said.Warsh, a former Fed governor who served from 2006 to 2011, has long been viewed as a credible pick for Republicans. Hassett has been a fixture of Trump's economic team across both terms, a proximity that some advisers now fear could undermine the Fed's institutional standing.The market move accelerated after Trump injected new ambiguity into the race late last week. After previously telling reporters he already knew whom he would choose as Fed chair, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that Warsh had risen to the top tier of contenders. ",

    "body": "Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPfizer on Tuesday forecast modest 2026 guidance as it looks to longer-term investments in its pipeline to counter waning Covid product sales and declines from older drugs.Those hurdles aren't surprising or new for Pfizer, which has seen a dramatic decline in Covid vaccine and antiviral sales after raking in record-setting revenue during the pandemic. The drugmaker has pursued deals of all sizes in recent years to build new revenue streams, such as its recently closed $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera and the whopping $43 billion tie-up for cancer drugmaker Seagen in 2023. But the guidance underscores that those investments are still some distance from paying off. Metsera, for example, brings a pipeline of drugs that are still in early-stage development. Shares of the company slid nearly 5% on Tuesday. The stock is also down about 5% for the year.The drugmaker expects adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share next year. That's slightly below analysts' consensus estimate of $3.05 per share for the year, according to LSEG. Revenue is expected to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, which would largely be flat compared to Pfizer's new 2025 sales guidance of $62 billion. Analysts were expecting 2026 sales of $61.59 billion, LSEG estimates said. The company said the lackluster revenue outlook comes in part from declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. Pfizer forecasts 2026 sales from these products will fall by about $1.5 billion year-over-year to $5 billion. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity. Some blockbuster drugs, such as the company's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, are facing more competition from rivals.Pfizer's patent expirations are primarily expected to occur in 2026 and 2028, the company's CFO Dave Denton said on an investor call Tuesday. He said the drugmaker expects $17 billion in revenues to be impacted by patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations. The blood thinner Eliquis, among the company's top sellers, will also have lower prices in Medicare starting next year after negotiations with the government as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Some analysts also noted that the guidance likely reflects costs tied to the company's recent acquisitions, including Metsera. In a note Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott called the outlook \"largely expected.\" He said the Covid headwinds and research and development investments will be partially offset by ongoing restructuring at the company. On an investor call Tuesday, Pfizer said it exceeded its cost-saving goals for 2025. The company is targeting more than $7 billion in cost cuts by 2027, and said Tuesday that it expects to deliver the majority of those savings by next year.Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the slightly lower 2026 outlook \"leaves room [for] adjustments in light of vaccine policy uncertainty.\" Pfizer and other drugmakers have had to grapple with changes to U.S. vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent shot skeptic. \"Given uncertainty with HHS policy, and infection rates we appreciate conservative estimates and cost-savings … heading into the new year,\" Seigerman said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said comments by the Food and Drug Administration around shots \"don't have merit\" and are \"not going to change the way we are looking at our long term investments in vaccines.\" Bourla did not point to specific remarks, but said he believes \"this anomaly will correct itself.\" Earlier this year, Pfizer struck a landmark drug pricing deal with the Trump administration, which includes selling its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. Pfizer will also guarantee the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers.In return, the company will get a three-year exemption from President Donald Trump's pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Denton said there is \"price compression and margin compression baked into\" the company's 2026 guidance as it plans to provide \"deeper discounts\" in its Medicaid business as part of the deal with Trump. ",

Anton Petrus | Moment | Getty ImagesU.S. crude oil on Tuesday fell below $55 per barrel, hitting the lowest level since early 2021 as traders factor in a looming surplus and the possiblity of a peace agreement in Ukraine. West Texas Intermediate hit a low of $54.98 per barrel, the lowest level since Feb. 3, 2021. The U.S. benchmark was last trading at $55.16, down 2.92%.  Global benchmark Brent was down 2.77% at $58.88 per barrel. U.S. gasoline prices, meanwhile, have fallen below $3 per gallon to the lowest level in four years, according to the motorist association AAA. The oil market is under pressure this year as OPEC+ members have rapidly ramped up production after years of output cuts. Investors are also pricing in the possibility of lower geopolitical risk as President Donald Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a peace agreement with Russia. The threat of supply disruptions has loomed over the oil market since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has launched repeated drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure this year. The U.S. and its European allies, meanwhile, have targeted Russia's crude industry with sanctions. ",

    "body": "Piotr Swat | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesKorea Zinc shares nosedived on Tuesday, as its largest shareholder is reportedly opposing plans to create a U.S.-backed joint venture that will see a dilution of its equity stake in the South Korean company.  Shares of the world's largest zinc smelting company had climbed over 26% on Monday, before paring gains to 5%, as it announced a $7.4 billion mineral smelter project in Tennessee. The stock ended Tuesday down 13.94%. The company's largest shareholder alliance is opposing the move and would seek a court injunction to stop the company from issuing new shares.  The Korea Times reported that the alliance, made up of private equity firm MBK Partners and conglomerate YoongPoong, said the plan was designed for company Chairman Choi Yun-beom to hold on to management control.Under the deal, a joint venture company will be set up to build the smelter in Tennessee, with the Pentagon having a 40% stake in the JV. As part of the project, Korea Zinc will sell new shares worth $1.9 billion to this joint venture controlled by the U.S. government and certain U.S.-based strategic investors that have not been named, effectively giving the group 10% stake in the South Korean company. South Korean media outlet Business Korea said that issuing 10% of new shares will reduce the combined Yoong-Poong-MBK stake ratio from about 44% to the \"high 30% range\" while allowing friendly stakes from Choi and the U.S. government to rise to the 40% range. Early Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a post on X that \"Starting in 2026, the United States will have priority access to Korea Zinc's expanded global production, putting American security and manufacturing FIRST.\"The Tennessee project seeks to build an integrated smelter producing base metals as well as critical and strategic minerals, with phased commercial operations targeted for 2029, Korea Zinc said in a statement.The planned critical minerals smelting and processing facility could produce 540,000 tons of materials in the U.S. per year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and comes as the U.S. seeks to form critical mineral partnerships that are not dependent on China.",

Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results. Over the weekend, real estate tech strategist Mike DelPrete published mobile phone screenshots of Google Search results showing real estate listings, which appeared to be powered by real estate data company HouseCanary. The listings enabled users to view the full details of a property's page, request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com's online marketplace portal. Google's home searches appear to work only in select markets and on mobile devices as testing is underway.The decline in Zillow signals investors are bracing for the eventual impact of Google's foray into the real estate market. The company, which saw shares drop more than 11% at one point during Monday's session, lost about $1.6 billion in market cap. Zillow's market cap now sits at about $16.26 billion.However, Wall Street analysts were quick to point out that Zillow's exposure to organic search is fairly small, limiting potential downside at least in the near term as more details around Google's product come to light. Wells Fargo analyst Alec Brondolo, who has an equal weight rating on Zillow, said he would not \"expect a meaningful financial impact from listings on Google shifting from organic to paid\" — given that Zillow is not overly dependent on organic search results for traffic.\"The listings product appears similar to Google Hotel Metasearch results; introduction could increase traffic cost to Zillow, but disintermediation unlikely,\" Brondolo said in a Monday note to clients. \"In the hotel category, Google merchandises hotel rooms in search results as a metasearch ad product for OTAs. We would expect a similar approach in real estate, with Zillow, Homes.com, Realtor.com, etc. bidding for home listing ad units rather than Google attempting to monetize directly with an ad product sold to agents.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZillow stock over the past year.But some analysts see Google's testing as a longer-term headwind to Zillow and other online real estate portals.Goldman Sachs' Michael Ng wrote in a note to clients that he believes the search engine's real estate listings, which he said are an advertising format for buy-side agents, directly compete with Zillow's Premier Agent program by \"facilitating lead generation\" for agents from prospective buyers.\"While we don't expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow's business, given that most of Zillow's traffic is direct (e.g., Zillow.com, StreetEasy.com, mobile apps) and Google's new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers, we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,\" Ng, who remains neutral on Zillow, wrote in a note to clients. Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer said that Google's expansion into real estate could impact the number of consumers going to Zillow.com — which was 228 million in the third quarter — and therefore could take a hit on the company's ability to monetize its platform. \"The impact would likely take years to play out and would need to be rolled out across the US to meaningfully impact real estate portal traffic,\" Helfstein said in a recent note.Zillow shares are down more than 8% year to date.

    "body": "U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon leaves after speaking at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, Nov. 20, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration continues to move slowly in processing a massive backlog of applications from hundreds of thousands of student loan borrowers seeking debt forgiveness or an affordable repayment plan, a new court filing shows. As of the end of November, 802,730 requests to transfer into an income-driven repayment plan remain pending with the Department of Education. IDR plans limit a borrower's monthly bill to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.Another 80,210 applications were still under review with the agency for Public Service Loan Forgiveness Buyback. That program allows certain public servants with 120 months of qualifying public service employment to retroactively pay for any months they missed because of a forbearance or deferment. Just 170 student loan borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan had their debt canceled during November, the agency reported, with 280 discharges issued for the month under PSLF. \"At this rate, they will never fully clear the backlog,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's unclear how the federal government shutdown — which spanned Oct. 1 to Nov. 12 — may have affected application processing during November. In its court filing, the agency only notes that the shutdown affected its ability to provide an exact number of new applications received that month. Many student loan borrowers rely on IDR plans and the loan forgiveness programs to be able to afford their monthly payments and to eventually emerge from their debt, consumer advocates say. Over 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump officials move slowly on student loan forgiveness, payment plans: court filingSurprise year-end income could derail your tax strategy — how to plan for itStudent loan borrowers, unaware of relief options, may pay 'more than necessary'Fraud cost older adults up to $81.5 billion in 2024 — more lost at least $100,000There's still time to maximize the 0% capital gains bracket for 2025Why affordability is the 'beating heart' of the ACA enhanced subsidy debateVantageScore's CEO: Average credit score is masking signs of financial distressSingle-stock ETFs can amplify returns, analyst says, but there's 'significant risk'Why single-income households are 'a bygone era,' according to expertsIRS releases HSA expansion details under Trump's 'big beautiful bill'What December's Fed rate cut means for your moneyStudent loan borrowers have 'a limited time' to leave payment pauseTax changes Social Security beneficiaries may see based on new lawsUncertainty over ACA subsidies persists as enrollment deadline loomsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedAs a result of a legal challenge brought by the American Federation of Teachers against the Trump administration, the Education Department agreed to share status updates on its processing of borrowers' applications. The AFT, a teacher's union representing some 1.8 million members, accused Trump officials of denying student loan borrowers their legally required rights. The lawsuit concluded in a settlement in October.In March, Trump officials terminated nearly half of the staff at the Education Department, including many of the people who helped assist borrowers. Backlog comes at a challenging time for borrowers IDR plans and loan forgiveness remain hard to access under the Trump administration amid an especially difficult time for federal student loan holders. Trump officials said in April that more than 5 million borrowers were in default at that time, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers. Borrowers are reeling from a weakening labor market and promises of relief that never materialized, experts say. The Biden administration announced debt forgiveness and a new repayment plan designed to dramatically reduce monthly payments, but Republican-led legal challenges blocked both of those provisions.\"The federal student loan portfolio is probably in the worst state it's ever been in,\" Kantrowitz said. Why the backlog may get worse The backlog of applications is likely to grow. The Trump administration recently announced that borrowers who enrolled in the now-defunct Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, will soon need to transfer to another plan. That could lead to millions of borrowers filing applications in the coming weeks or months. As of July, there were more than 7.6 million borrowers in SAVE, according to the Education Department.Although SAVE has been fully blocked since a February court order, millions of borrowers remain enrolled in the SAVE forbearance that Biden officials established while the legal challenges against its program unfolded. SAVE enrollees have already found it difficult to restart repayment on another plan, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CNBC earlier this month. \"Many clients have taken steps to move out of the SAVE forbearance but are waiting months for their IDR applications to be processed,\" Nierman said. In August, Trump officials resumed charging interest for borrowers who stayed in that payment pause.\"Their loans are getting bigger and bigger as interest accrues, but they can't do anything about it,\" Kantrowitz said.

    "body": "The U.S. has halted a technology trade deal with the U.K., after officials in Washington became frustrated with the pace of progress, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.Announced in September during President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., the \"technology prosperity deal\" is a sweeping agreement aimed at encouraging collaboration between the countries on tech like artificial intelligence, nuclear fusion, and quantum computing.At the time, Trump said that the deal would \"ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side.\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the agreement was a \"generational step change in our relationship with the U.S.\"  that would deliver \"growth, security and opportunity up and down the country.\"Talks were suspended by the U.S. last week, the FT reported, quoting unnamed British officials.When asked to comment on the report, a U.K. government spokesperson told CNBC: \"Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the Tech Prosperity Deal delivers opportunity for hardworking people in both countries.\"watch nowThe agreement would establish AI-enabled research programs in areas including the development of models and datasets in mutual priorities such as AI for biotechnology, precision medicine for cancer and rare and chronic diseases, and fusion energy, the two countries said in September.It came as the U.K. signed deals totalling £31 billion ($41 billion) with U.S. tech firms like Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, and CoreWeave to build out the country's AI infrastructure. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner.The U.S. Department of Commerce has been approached for comment. ",

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, one of the finalists for the Federal Reserve chair job, showed support Tuesday for central bank independence.With President Donald Trump apparently in the final days of picking a successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, Hassett declined in a CNBC interview to directly address his own candidacy but said forging consensus is an important part of the job.\"The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too,\" he said. \"So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data.\"Prior to last week, Hassett had been considered the leading contender for the job to take over for Powell, who is nearing the end of his second term as head of the central bank. However, Trump said last week that former Governor Kevin Warsh has come to the front of the pack as well, following an interview between the two last Wednesday.There has been some pushback against Hassett in recent days. Sources told CNBC that the president's advisors worry that Hassett will be perceived as too close to Trump and will do his bidding rather than seek to set interest rates in line with the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.However, Hassett said his relationship with Trump shouldn't be held against him.\"The idea that someone isn't qualified for the job because they are a close friend who's worked well with the president is something that I think the President rejects,\" he said.Though he appointed Powell, Trump has been a constant critic of the Fed chief. Trump has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts, unsatisfied even as the FOMC has approved three consecutive cuts since September totaling three quarters of a percentage point. Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee who came on board in September, has voted against each of those reductions in favor of half-point cuts.Hassett stressed the need for consensus building at the Fed. Trump has advocated that the Fed should consult the president when making rate decisions.\"The way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,\" he said. \"When you get things wrong, you explain why and fix it. So that's the way it moves forward. But the President is a seasoned observer of the economy, and if he has a good point, then I'm sure others will recognize it as such.\"Hassett and Warsh were part of five finalists for the job. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the process, said Tuesday morning on Fox Business that the decision likely will come in early January.",

    "body": "Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot Corp., speaks during a Prime Air delivery drone reveal event in Las Vegas, June 5, 2019.Joe Buglewicz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesColin Angle, co-founder and former CEO of iRobot, on Monday said the company's move to declare bankruptcy was \"profoundly disappointing\" and \"nothing short of a tragedy for consumers.\"The robotic vacuum pioneer announced Sunday that it filed for bankruptcy and will be taken private by Shenzhen Picea Robotics, a lender and key supplier, following years of financial struggles.\"Today's outcome is profoundly disappointing — and it was avoidable,\" Angle told CNBC in a statement. \"This is nothing short of a tragedy for consumers, the robotics industry and America's innovation economy.\"In a Sunday court filing, iRobot said it had between $100 million and $500 million of assets and liabilities. The company said it owes almost $100 million to its new owner Picea, more than $5.8 million to GXO Logistics and roughly $3.4 million to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for unpaid tariffs, among other liabilities.Shares of iRobot plunged more than 72% on Monday.watch nowFounded in 1990 by Angle and two other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iRobot got its start making military and defense tech for the government before launching its flagship Roomba product in 2002 that cemented it as an early leader in the robotic vacuum cleaner market. The company's future has remained uncertain after Amazon abandoned its planned $1.7 billion acquisition of the company in January 2024, citing regulatory scrutiny from the European Union and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Afterward, iRobot laid off 31% of staff and Angle announced he would step down as CEO and board chair. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called regulators' efforts to block the deal a \"sad story\" and said it would've given iRobot a competitive boost against rivals. The Amazon acquisition was \"the most viable path\" for iRobot to compete globally, Angle said Monday. He added that iRobot's bankruptcy serves as a \"warning\" for competition watchdogs. Helen Greiner, one of iRobot's co-founders, said in a Monday LinkedIn post that the company's restructuring plan under a Chinese owner isn't good for \"consumers, employees, stockholders, Massachusetts or the USA.\" The company had been facing growing competition from cheaper, rapidly growing rivals, such as China-based Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock. Supply chain constraints in recent years added further strain to iRobot's business, as it struggled to navigate shipping and inventory delays, which dented its revenue.Its financial outlook darkened significantly after the Amazon deal fell apart, and in October, iRobot said it would be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if it failed to secure more capital or find a buyer.Gary Cohen, iRobot CEO, said in a statement Monday that the restructuring plan would help secure the company's \"long-term future.\" The bankruptcy proceedings aren't expected to disrupt its products' functionality or customer support, iRobot said. The company's third-quarter sales came in at $145.8 million, down almost 25% from $193.4 million one year earlier, and iRobot has about $190 million in debt. ",

The company, which owns popular payment app Venmo, hopes to also offer interest-bearing savings accounts to its customers, the statement said. PayPal already makes credit lines available to consumers and has been trying to expand its roster of banking-like services as it competes with a growing number of fintech companies that are aiming to take business from traditional brick-and-mortar banks.Shares of PayPal rose 1.5% in extended trading following the announcement.

    "body": "watch nowKraft Heinz on Tuesday announced that former Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane will lead the company ahead of its planned split next year.Cahillane will join the Oscar Mayer owner as chief executive on Jan. 1. After Kraft Heinz divides into two publicly traded companies, he will serve as CEO of the business it is temporarily calling Global Taste Elevation, which will include high-growth brands like Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac & Cheese.\"These are phenomenal brands that need to be contemporized, shown a little bit of love and brought back to growth,\" Cahillane said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street,\" comparing the opportunity with Kraft Heinz with the one he tackled at Kellogg.Cahillane previously led Kellogg through its own breakup in 2023. The company split its sluggish North American cereal business from its high-growth snacking unit, which was then renamed Kellanova. Cahillane stayed on as chief executive of Kellanova until Mars acquired the company for $35.9 billion.Outgoing Kraft Heinz CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera was originally tapped to lead the other company known as North American Grocery. However, he will now serve as an advisor through March 6. Abrams-Rivera has been chief executive of the food giant since 2024.The Kraft Heinz board will initiate a search for a chief executive to lead the portfolio of grocery staples, which includes brands like Oscar Mayer and Kraft Singles.As part of the transition, John Cahill, who served as CEO of Kraft during its merger with Heinz a decade ago, will succeed Miguel Patricio as chair of the board.Kraft Heinz is projecting that the separation will happen in the second half of 2026. The company announced the breakup plans in September, following years of sluggish sales despite turnaround efforts. The split reverses much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world.Kraft Heinz shares rose 1% in morning trading. The stock has fallen about 20% this year.",

    "body": "The logo of an Apple Store is seen reflected on the glass exterior of a Samsung flagship store in Shanghai, China Monday, Oct. 20, 2025.Wang Gang | Feature China | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesA shortage of memory chips fueled by artificial intelligence players is likely to cause a price rise in smartphones in 2026 and a drop in shipments, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Tuesday.Smartphone shipments could fall 2.1% in 2026, according to Counterpoint, versus a previous outlook of flat-to-positive growth.Shipments do not equate to sales but are a measure of demand as they track the number of devices being sent to sales channels like stores. Meanwhile, the average selling price of smartphones could jump 6.9% year-on-year in 2026, Counterpoint said, in comparison to a previous forecast of a 3.6% rise.This is being driven by specific chip shortages and bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain, which are pushing up component prices.The continued build-out of data centres globally has hiked demand for systems developed by Nvidia, which in turn uses components designed by SK Hynix and Samsung — the two biggest suppliers of so-called memory chips. watch nowHowever, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, is also critical for smartphones. DRAM prices have surged this year as demand outstrips supply. For low-end smartphones priced below $200, the bill of materials cost has increased 20% to 30% since the beginning of the year, Counterpoint said. The bill of materials is the cost of producing a single smartphone. The mid and high-end smartphone segment has seen material costs rise 10% to 15%. \"Memory prices could rise another 40% through Q2 2026, resulting in BoM costs increasing anywhere between 8% and over 15% above current elevated levels,\" Counterpoint said. The rising price of components could be passed on to consumers and that will in turn, drive the rise in the average selling price.\"Apple and Samsung are best positioned to weather the next few quarters,\" MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint, said in the note. \"But it will be tough for others that don't have as much wiggle room to manage market share versus profit margins.\"Hwang said this will \"play out especially\" with Chinese smartphone makers who are in the mid-to-lower end of the market. Counterpoint said some companies may downgrade components like camera modules, displays and even audio, as well as reusing old components. Smartphone players are likely to try to incentivize consumers to buy their higher-priced devices too. ",

    "body": "LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky sees a lot of career advice on the site every day, but he doesn't always agree with every piece that's shared.One common tip that Roslansky said is \"a little bit outdated\" is that \"you have to have a five-year plan,\" he told content creator Erin McGoff in an interview for her YouTube channel AdviceWithErin. In Roslansky's view, having a five-year plan is \"a little bit foolish,\" he said: given how rapidly technology and the workplace are changing, it's not realistic to \"chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like.\"Instead, Roslansky advised workers to focus on what they want to learn and what experiences they want to have.\"I think that's the right mental model in this environment,\" he said. \"If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you.\"According to Roslansky, having a linear career path isn't realistic anymore. Many people think \"you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then become a consultant and then get an MBA,\" he said – but \"that's not how it happens at all for most people.\"Once you let go of that idea, \"you can take your own career into your own hands,\" he said. \"No one is trying to figure this out for you. You have to take care of it yourself.\"His advice for young professionalsRoslansky also shared his best advice for young people navigating their careers right now.His first tip is to \"learn the tools\" and experiment with using AI at work, he told McGoff.\"Try and figure out how to create a PowerPoint presentation out of chat,\" he said. \"You know, figure out how this can help you with a better marketing message.\"\"Whether or not you like it, whether or not it's a good fit for what you're trying to do, that mental model – like, 'I'm going to use this tool and learn it to help me do something' – I think is the most important thing,\" he continued.Still, \"it's not just about the tools and technology,\" Roslansky said: skills like empathy, judgment and communication are still \"critical\" in the modern workplace.\"In a world where everyone is kind of, you know, focused more on the technology, if you really work on a lot of those human skills, it can be a great differentiator for you,\" he said.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Brian Glaser became a first-time manager about 20 years ago when he says he was promoted \"overnight\" into a leadership position at JetBlue.He had a lot to learn as a boss and now, two decades later, is the chief learning officer at Google, where he oversees teams in charge of onboarding and training for some 150,000 employees worldwide.One of the biggest lessons he learned while moving from an individual contributor to overseeing others' work was \"trusting others to get the work done,\" Glaser tells CNBC Make It.\"I remember so much of what gave me fulfillment was getting the job done right, really tackling the project, meeting the deadline, and knowing that I was single-handedly able to contribute to the goal,\" he says.Becoming a manager, though, he had to realize it wasn't about doing the work and getting credit for it. Rather, \"it's about getting work done effectively through others, which means you have to really understand their styles or motivations and work to bring out the best so that they can really deliver excellent outcomes.\"He heard it put once that as an individual contributor, you're trying to make lightning strike; as a manager, you have to create the conditions for lightning to strike.Google chief's 3 secrets to good leadershipGlaser says he's constantly working on the balancing act of setting long-term goals for his teams and charting the paths to achieve them.He's learned from his past mistakes: \"I think where I've messed up over the years [is] I've indexed more on the vision and the future\" rather than being concrete in the smaller steps and benchmarks to get there. Without that path, \"It's very easy for the team to burn out.\"Glaser says bosses should keep three pillars in mind as they lead their teams:Set a direction rather than a destination. The time of spending years on building a long-term strategy is \"over,\" Glaser says. He advises pointing teams in a direction and encouraging them to be agile and pivot when challenges arise, even if that means landing in a slightly different place than originally planned, rather than focusing solely on one potential outcome.Be willing to be wrong. Glaser says this mindset is crucial to be innovative and try things for the first time; it's also important to be able to course-correct when things aren't working out as planned. As leaders, \"we have to move from being a know-it-all to being more of a learn-it-all, which means we have to ask better questions,\" Glaser says. \"We have to be willing to take multiple perspectives and admit to people when we don't know the answer.\"Pay attention to the human side of change. AI is impacting businesses faster than ever, and Glaser says a good leader will pay attention to how those changes influence their teams socially, emotionally and cognitively. It comes down to leading with empathy, he says: \"How do we really help meet them where they are, so that we can come through whatever it is that we're going through as a team together?\"His best advice for a first-time managerFor anyone else leading a team for the first time, Glaser says \"the most important thing\" is to focus on building connections with your reports to understand \"the experiences, the interests, the aspirations of your people.\"Doing so builds trust, he says, which is a foundational part of what makes a high-performing team and helps them move through challenges and ultimately succeed.\"If nothing else,\" Glaser says, \"really invest time in getting to know your people, building those relationships, and all else will follow.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Shoppers carry Macy's bags outside of Macy's flagship store on Black Friday in New York, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Adam Gray | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAndre Lewis said he's \"anxious 364 days of the year.\" Yet the rideshare and delivery driver wants to make it a special holiday season for his 7-year-old daughter.\"I told myself I'd keep it modest,\" said the 31-year-old, who lives in New York City. But he said his daughter wants a pink keyboard that lights up, and he'll buy it for her — \"even if it's a little over budget.\"\"Christmas is the one day I let myself stop worrying,\" he said. For many U.S. consumers like Lewis, economic worries have cast a cloud over an otherwise cheery season. Consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in more than three years in early November, close to its all-time low, according to University of Michigan's monthly survey. The metric posted a slight uptick in December.Yet so far, that downbeat backdrop hasn't stopped shopping this year or dragged down the typical kickoff of the holiday season. That apparent contrast has left investors and economists wondering whether — and when — jitters over high costs of living, increased tariffs and a tepid job market will start to emerge more in spending data. Across the country, nearly 203 million U.S. shoppers hit retailers' stores and websites during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday — the highest turnout in at least nine years, according to the National Retail Federation, which surveys shoppers to calculate the annual estimate.Big-box and club retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Costco, topped Wall Street's quarterly sales expectations, and executives said they saw an encouraging start to the crucial shopping season. Meanwhile, discretionary retailers like Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle also exceeded quarterly estimates, and company leaders said consumer demand has been steady. \"I know everybody's looking for cracks in consumer health,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC in late November. \"It feels pretty consistent to us.\"Some executives also said lower-income consumers, who have felt economic pressures most acutely over the last year, have kept spending.\"The headline is that we feel very good about the lower-income customer,\" Burlington Stores CEO Michael O'Sullivan said when the company quarterly results last month. \"This customer has been very resilient. When we look at our stores in lower-income trade areas, they continue to outperform the chain.\"Some key dynamics have supported U.S. consumer spending, even as concerns about an AI investment bubble and layoffs by companies including Verizon and Target cloud the 2026 economic outlook. Unemployment numbers are still relatively low, though the labor market has slowed. While the U.S. added more jobs than expected in November, the unemployment rate hit the highest level in four years, according to delayed government data released Tuesday. Separate ADP figures showed the private sector unexpectedly lost jobs in November. Higher-income consumers, in particular, have propped up retail sales as they benefit from rising home values and stock market gains. And holiday spending, in particular, tends to be insulated since families across incomes prioritize the season, even if that means sacrificing other kinds of spending or racking up the credit card bill. Marcus Feldman, a biotech project manager from Cambridge, Mass., said he will spend about 15% more this year on the holidays. He and his wife plan to take their 9- and 12-year-old sons on a skiing trip, and splurge on nicer gifts.\"It's partly because we can and partly because life's short and the boys are only little once,\" he said.And, he added, he's noticed others spending freely.\"Every headline says people are scared to spend,\" he said. \"Then I walk down [one of Boston's major shopping streets] Newbury Street on a Saturday and it's shoulder-to-shoulder.\"On a call with reporters in early December, National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay said \"there's a bit of a moat\" around holiday spending, a time when emotions fuel demand.\"One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget,\" he said on the call.Plus, as interest rates remain high, consumers have put off some of the priciest purchases they typically make, such as new houses and cars. That's freed up money for spending on goods, said Naveen Jaggi, who leads retail transaction and advisory services at commercial real estate services firm JLL.Black Friday signage at a Target store ahead of Black Friday in Jersey City, New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStill, warning signs loom over the economy. Nearly every retailer has said consumers continue to be selective about spending and are looking for deals to stretch dollars. Shoppers' hunt for deep discounts fueled strong turnout and growth during the sales days known for promotions, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. Some of the retail spending growth has come from price hikes, which have persisted even as the rate of inflation eases.After being hit by higher prices for groceries, electricity and housing, consumers are seizing upon sales to get ahead of further price increases.Eugenio Aleman, chief economist for equity research firm Raymond James, attributes lower consumer sentiment to price hikes. He said that's accelerated some purchases because shoppers worry prices will keep going up.\"Even though they feel bad, they say, 'Okay, I have to do whatever it takes to buy now,'\" he said. The say and do gapThe contrast between spending data and consumer sentiment captures a head-scratching gap between what consumers are saying and what they are doing.That divergence dates back to 2021, soon after the Covid pandemic, when surveys of consumer spending intentions became less predictive of their behavior, said Ali Furman, the U.S. consumer markets industry leader for consulting firm PwC.In particular, she said PwC has seen higher-income households and those on the East and West Coasts more likely to keep spending, even as they report a low sentiment.That gap influenced PwC's own holiday forecast. Its consumer survey during late June and early July indicated that holiday shoppers planned to pull back on purchases from last year, with Gen Z consumers especially slashing their budgets.Based on that survey, PwC projected that consumers' average spending on holiday gifts, travel and entertainment would decline 5% from the year-ago period.Yet in late October, it surveyed consumers again and reversed its projections. PwC now expects consumers across age groups will spend 3% to 4% more on the holidays year over year. Furman said consumers may have felt a little better in the fall, as some worries about higher tariffs faded and they saw retailers' holiday merchandise start to hit the shelves. The durability of consumer spending has even surprised the National Retail Federation, the industry's major trade group. For the vast majority of months this year, retail sales have climbed nearly or more than 4% year over year, according to U.S. Census Bureau retail figures. That's higher than the 2.7% to 3.7% annual year-over-year growth that the trade group predicted.Companies tread cautiouslyIt's not just consumers: Businesses have shown caution about their spending. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to be the lowest in at least 15 years, according to the NRF, as companies try to manage higher costs from tariffs.Retailers have also stressed the unpredictability of consumer behavior, even when posting otherwise strong results.Macy's, for example, earlier this month reported its strongest growth in more than three years as it made progress on its turnaround strategy. Still, it disappointed Wall Street with a cautious forecast for the holiday quarter. CEO Tony Spring told CNBC that the \"customer is hanging in there,\" but is still spending selectively. Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said the warehouse club, which has benefitted from consumers seeking value, has seen \"bumpy\" trends that have muddied a consistent pattern of consumers spending more and seeking value, quality and new items.\"When you look at month by month, there's definitely been some lumpiness in the individual monthly sales results that we've posted,\" he said on an earnings call on Thursday.  The buzzwords retail executives have used in public comments underscore how confusing the consumer backdrop has become. CEOs in recent years have repeatedly called shoppers \"choiceful\" about their spending.Yet retailers have also started to describe consumers as \"resilient.\" In the most recent round of earnings calls, leaders from Macy's, Burlington Stores, Tapestry, Abercrombie & Fitch and Ralph Lauren all used the word to describe their customers.At some companies, it's unclear if healthy results have come from individual execution or a strong economy. The retail industry has been more starkly divided between winners and losers over the last year, and those that are executing well have won the dollars of selective shoppers.For example, Gap's Old Navy, which primarily caters to low- and middle-income shoppers, had an \"incredibly strong\" third quarter, CEO Richard Dickson said. The apparel brand's comparable sales rose 6%, far better than the 3.8% increase analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Dickson said shoppers responded to value across all income groups, as the brand saw \"consistency and strength in our customer behavior.\" Still, Gap has been in the midst of a major turnaround and only started posting stronger results after Dickson took over. Trading down and looking for dealsBlack Friday signage inside a Walmart store on Black Friday in Columbus, Ohio, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Brian Kaiser | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEven as U.S. consumers have shown resilience, there have also been clues that they're making tradeoffs and trying to get more for their money. Value-oriented retailers including Walmart and Dollar General have attracted more high-income shoppers. Off-price chains like TJX-owned T.J. Maxx and mall names like Gap have also drawn in wealthier shoppers who are looking for home decor and clothing. Luc Wathieu, a professor of marketing at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, said the disconnect between sentiment and spending is a \"paradox,\" but added shoppers and retailers have left behind a trail of breadcrumbs to explain it. He said holiday season has gotten off to a strong start because people are shopping early around events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday to save money. Retailers have been able to meet that demand and keep offering deals because of the extra inventory they bought earlier this year to avoid tariffs. Many experts expect companies to sell through those items by the end of the year. For those reasons, \"we should see a very good beginning of the season\" but \"a pretty bad end of the season,\" said Wathieu, the research director of the NRF Business of Retail Initiative at Georgetown.Consumers also feel like they don't have control over what's happening around them during an indulgent season, which is fueling spending despite their negative outlook, Wathieu said.\"It's a little bit like dancing on the Titanic before it collapses, right?\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to happen. We might as well live our life in the meantime.\"Plus, industry growth so far this season may be more related to inflation than actual strong demand, said Omair Tariq, the founder and CEO of Cart.com, which provides logistics, fulfillment and other services for retailers including Eddie Bauer, Adidas and Guess. Tariq told CNBC more than half of Cart's customers confirmed they were raising prices this year, and those companies' volumes fell after the hikes took effect.\"Conversion dropped, order volume dropped,\" Tariq said. \"What we saw was that even during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, while there was obviously some growth, it was in in the low single digits.\"In Salesforce's Cyber Week results, the company found the average selling price over the Thanksgiving selling weekend was up 6% compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, volumes only grew 2% globally and 1% in the U.S. Lewis, the rideshare and delivery driver, shopped at Brookfield Place in downtown Manhattan last week. Income is up and down with his job, he said, but a wave of holiday visitors to New York has boosted business for now. He bought a pair of Nike shoes for his daughter while at the mall.Yet to make sure he has enough for her, he's trimmed back in other ways. He's put off shoe purchases for himself, postponed a phone upgrade and hasn't taken a trip in over a year.\"I want her to feel like the world is full of possibility,\" he said.— CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report.",

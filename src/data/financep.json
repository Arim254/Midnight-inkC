    "body": "Honda vehicles are lined up at a vehicle storage yard at an industrial port, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump struck a trade deal with Japan that lowers tariffs on auto imports, in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Japan, July 23, 2025. Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersJapan's exports in November rose at their fastest rate in nine months this year, growing at 6.1% year on year, data from the country's finance ministry released Wednesday showed.   The growth sharply beat expectations of an average 4.8% rise estimated by economists polled by Reuters, and was higher than the 3.6% seen in the previous month.  The export numbers were supported by a 23.6% increase in goods shipped to Western Europe, as well as an 8.8% rise in exports to the U.S., its second largest trading partner. This marks the first time that exports to the U.S. from Japan have increased since March.The data comes after revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that Japan's economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis. Shipments to mainland China fell 2.4%, but exports to Hong Kong jumped 11.4% compared to the same period the previous year.In November, tensions between Japan and China rose after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could trigger an intervention by Japan's military, leading to Beijing restricting imports of Japanese seafood. Imports into Japan rose 1.3% in November, compared to expectations of a 2.5% rise. Trade frictions aside, Japanese companies are positive on business growth, with the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing that sentiment among Japanese companies mostly improved in the fourth quarter, especially among small manufacturers.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stateside ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of Venezuela as tensions ramp up between Washington and the South American country. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said \"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"He added, \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before — Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"\"For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" Trump said. According to the U.S. State Department, the designation of a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to knowingly provide \"material support or resources\" to such an organization, among other measures. Andy Lipow, President of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNBC that a full embargo of Venezuelan oil would affect 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of oil per day, which could increase prices by about $2-$3 per barrel. Currently, prices of Brent crude are flat at $58.92, while West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.05% to $55.85.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThis would still leave the world \"well supplied\" as the there's global oil surplus of about 2 million barrels per day, Lipow said. However, Lipow also pointed out that \"The oil market will be watching the Chinese reaction as they are the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, benefiting from discounted prices and, they may be reluctant to observe USA sanctions, keeping Venezuelan oil flowing into the market.\"— CNBC's Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",

Warner Bros. plans to spin out Discovery Global, which includes a large portfolio of pay TV networks, including CNN and TNT.Trump last week said Netflix's proposed deal, which requires regulatory approval, \"could be a problem\" because of how much market share Netflix would end up with.Trump said he will be involved in the process of approving the deal.The WB water tower is seen at Warner Bros.

    "body": "The Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNasdaq is moving closer to around-the-clock stock trading, a shift that some on Wall Street are calling unnecessary — and potentially destabilizing.The exchange said it plans to submit paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow U.S.-listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week. If approved, the new schedule would launch in the second half of 2026.Under the proposal, Nasdaq would expand trading hours to 23 hours each weekday from the current 16 hours. Stocks would trade in a \"day session\" from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, followed by a one-hour pause for maintenance, testing and clearing. A \"night session\" would then run from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. the following morning.Critics argue that formalizing nearly nonstop trading could worsen some of the very problems that plague the structure of equity markets today — thin liquidity, sharp price swings and an increasingly \"gamified\" trading environment.'Worst thing in the world'\"This is literally the worst thing in the world,\" the Wells Fargo trading desk wrote in a note to clients. \"I cannot think of an action that single-handedly gamifies the stock market even more than it has already become. This is the epitome of making trading even more like gambling.\"Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and a former market maker on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, raised concerns about the impact on listed companies themselves.\"Listed companies need a time to break and release news events and to have meetings where they're not moving markets, and now we're taking that away from them,\" Woods said. \"You're opening up a new can of worms.\"Nasdaq currently operates three weekday sessions: pre-market trading from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., the regular session from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and after-hours trading from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.Retail-focused brokers, including Robinhood, have already rolled out extended or near-24-hour trading for certain U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies, responding to demand from individual investors who want the ability to trade on global news at any time.The New York Stock Exchange is pursuing its own extended-hours model, with plans for 22 hours of weekday trading that won initial SEC approval in February, contingent on data-feed upgrades.Liquidity clusterWells Fargo added that most liquidity already clusters around the market open and close, making the idea of stretching trading hours even further counterproductive. \"Most of the complaints that I hear on market structure are about how bad volumes are as most comes in around the open and close,\" the note said. \"And the industry move is to then elongate the trading day even further? This makes no sense at all.\"While Nasdaq says extended hours could eventually attract more participation, skeptics ask whether firms would be forced to staff trading desks around the clock.\"We know between 9:30 and 4, most traders are at their desk. The biggest institutions are working,\" Woods said. \"Are we going to have to add a whole new ecosphere of traders and institutions to man the desks so they can participate around the clock?\"Woods believes pauses in trading serve a purpose, enabling markets to digest information and participants to reset.\"We take breaks for a reason,\" Woods said. \"Let's recharge the batteries. Let's all get on the same page. We already have volatility ... during the day. If things move too far, too fast, we take a pause.\"",

    "body": "Tesla electric vehicles (EV) in front of the company's store in Colma, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA California administrative law judge recently ruled recently that Tesla's marketing around its \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" systems had been deceptive, and that the company should face a 30-day suspension of each of its licenses to sell and manufacture cars in the state, according to California's Department of Motor Vehicles. The California DMV made formal accusations of false advertising against Tesla in 2022. Steve Gordon, the agency's director, said in a press conference on Tuesday that the regulator will now give Elon Musk's automaker 90 days to clarify or remove deceptive or confusing language about its Autopilot and FSD systems before implementing a 30-day suspension of the company's sales license. Gordon also said the DMV will stay the order to suspend Tesla's manufacturing license so there will be no interruption to the company's factory operations in the state.In 2022, the DMV said that Tesla's \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" marketing suggested the company's cars were capable of operating autonomously, though they required an attentive driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Since that time, Tesla has changed the name of its premium, driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving (Supervised). Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Tesla's stock price closed at a record on Tuesday, largely due to increased enthusiasm on Wall Street surrounding the company's plans for its Robotaxis.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Paul Putnam, 53, a rancher and independent contract pumper walks past a pump jack in Loving County, Texas, November 25, 2019.Angus Mordant | ReutersU.S. crude oil prices fell nearly 3% on Tuesday to close at the lowest level since early 2021, as a looming surplus and possible peace agreement in Ukraine weigh on the market.  West Texas Intermediate fell 2.73%, or $1.55, to close at $55.27 per barrel, the lowest since February 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Global benchmark Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92. U.S. crude has shed about 23% this year in its worst performance since 2018, while Brent is down about 21% for its worst year since 2020.U.S. gasoline prices have fallen below $3 per gallon to the lowest level in four years in a boost to consumers ahead of the holidays, according to the drivers' association AAA. Falling oil prices could signal a slowing economy. U.S. job growth totalled 64,000 in November but declined by 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6%.The oil market is under pressure this year as OPEC+ members have rapidly ramped up production after years of output cuts. Investors are also pricing in the possibility of lower geopolitical risk as President Donald Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a peace agreement with Russia. The threat of supply disruptions has loomed over the oil market since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has launched repeated drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure this year. The U.S. and its European allies, meanwhile, have targeted Russia's crude industry with sanctions. Ukraine's attacks on oil infrastructure and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies would likely be lifted relatively quickly in the event of an agreement, said Jorge Leon, Rystad Energy's head of geopolitical analysis, in a note to clients. \"This would significantly reduce the risk of near-term Russian supply disruptions and allow a sizeable volume of Russian oil currently stored on water to return to the market,\" Leon said. Russian oil stored on water is currently estimated at around 170 million barrels, according to Rystad.The end of U.S. sanctions on Russia would also change the incentives for OPEC+, Leon said. The group would likely resume a strategy to retake market share through higher production after recently pressing pause on that approach, he said. ",

    "body": "A job seeker speaks with a recruiter at the KeySource booth at the Mega JobNewsUSA South Florida Job Fair held in the Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, on April 30, 2025.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesNonfarm payrolls grew slightly more than expected in November but slumped in October while unemployment hit its highest in four years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday in numbers delayed by the government shutdown.Job growth totaled a seasonally adjusted 64,000 for the month, better than the Dow Jones estimate of 45,000 and up from a sharp decline in October.The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, more than expected and its highest level since September 2021. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons swelled to 8.7%, its peak going back to August 2021.In addition to the November report, the BLS released an abbreviated October count that showed payrolls down 105,000. While there was no official estimate, Wall Street economists were largely expecting a decline following a surprise increase of 108,000 in September. The October slump came from a steep fall in government employment as deferred layoffs instituted earlier this year took effect. Government payrolls were off 162,000 for the month, and fell an additional 6,000 in November.The October decline marked the third time in six months that payrolls saw a net negative level. The BLS report also showed that August's numbers were revised down 22,000 to show a steeper loss of 26,000, while September's initial count was pushed lower by 11,000.The BLS had cautioned that the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, will be affected for several months by impacts of the shutdown. Challenges in capturing the October numbers led to the cancellation of both the jobs report and the closely watched consumer price index.Despite the complications, the report painted a familiar picture of the labor market. The jobs climate continues to be one of low hiring and low firing, affected as well by stringent border practices under President Donald Trump that have drained the workforce of the usual influx of immigrants. The establishment numbers showed most of the gains in November came from a familiar source — health care added 46,000 jobs, accounting for more than 70% of the total net increase. Construction rose by 28,000, while social assistance contributed 18,000.On the down side, transportation and warehousing was off 18,000, part of a continuing trend in job losses for the sector. Leisure and hospitality also posted a loss of 12,000. \"The U.S. economy is in a jobs recession,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The nation has added a mere 100,000 in the past six months. The bulk of those jobs were in healthcare, an industry that is almost always hiring due to America's aging population.\"However, the White House put a positive spin on the report.\"The strong jobs report shows how President Trump is fixing the damage caused by Joe Biden and creating a strong, America First economy in record time,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Workers' wages are rising, prices are falling, trillions of dollars in investments are pouring into our country, and the American economy is primed to boom in 2026.\"From a policy perspective, the Federal Reserve has had to work a difficult line between trying to head off further weakness in the labor market and guarding against making stubbornly high inflation worse.At its most recent meeting, the central bank lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point but signaled that the bar is higher for additional cuts. The Fed has approved three consecutive reductions since September, taking its benchmark funds rate down to a target range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"The Fed is unlikely to put much weight on today's report given data disruptions,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory.\"Markets continued to put low odds on another rate cut in January. The probability was around 24.4% following the jobs report, unchanged from Monday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Fed officials have maintained that the labor market is not a source of inflation, and Tuesday's jobs report backed up that assertion.Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, below the estimate for 0.3%, and were up 3.5% from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since May 2021.The 0.1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was largely a function of labor force growth.Over the two-month period, household employment actually increased by 407,000. However, that was offset partially by a rise of 323,000 in the labor force as the participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were flat in September, against a forecast for a 0.1% increase, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Excluding autos, however, sales increased 0.4%, better than the 0.2% estimate.",

    "body": "Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPfizer on Tuesday forecast modest 2026 guidance as it looks to longer-term investments in its pipeline to counter waning Covid product sales and declines from older drugs.Those hurdles aren't surprising or new for Pfizer, which has seen a dramatic decline in Covid vaccine and antiviral sales after raking in record-setting revenue during the pandemic. The drugmaker has pursued deals of all sizes in recent years to build new revenue streams, such as its recently closed $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera and the whopping $43 billion tie-up for cancer drugmaker Seagen in 2023. But the guidance underscores that those investments are still some distance from paying off. Metsera, for example, brings a pipeline of drugs that are still in early-stage development. Shares of the company slid nearly 5% on Tuesday. The stock is also down about 5% for the year.The drugmaker expects adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share next year. That's slightly below analysts' consensus estimate of $3.05 per share for the year, according to LSEG. Revenue is expected to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion, which would largely be flat compared to Pfizer's new 2025 sales guidance of $62 billion. Analysts were expecting 2026 sales of $61.59 billion, LSEG estimates said. The company said the lackluster revenue outlook comes in part from declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid. Pfizer forecasts 2026 sales from these products will fall by about $1.5 billion year-over-year to $5 billion. Pfizer also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity. Some blockbuster drugs, such as the company's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, are facing more competition from rivals.Pfizer's patent expirations are primarily expected to occur in 2026 and 2028, the company's CFO Dave Denton said on an investor call Tuesday. He said the drugmaker expects $17 billion in revenues to be impacted by patent and regulatory exclusivity expirations. The blood thinner Eliquis, among the company's top sellers, will also have lower prices in Medicare starting next year after negotiations with the government as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Some analysts also noted that the guidance likely reflects costs tied to the company's recent acquisitions, including Metsera. In a note Tuesday, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott called the outlook \"largely expected.\" He said the Covid headwinds and research and development investments will be partially offset by ongoing restructuring at the company. On an investor call Tuesday, Pfizer said it exceeded its cost-saving goals for 2025. The company is targeting more than $7 billion in cost cuts by 2027, and said Tuesday that it expects to deliver the majority of those savings by next year.Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the slightly lower 2026 outlook \"leaves room [for] adjustments in light of vaccine policy uncertainty.\" Pfizer and other drugmakers have had to grapple with changes to U.S. vaccine policy under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent shot skeptic. \"Given uncertainty with HHS policy, and infection rates we appreciate conservative estimates and cost-savings … heading into the new year,\" Seigerman said. On the call, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said comments by the Food and Drug Administration around shots \"don't have merit\" and are \"not going to change the way we are looking at our long term investments in vaccines.\" Bourla did not point to specific remarks, but said he believes \"this anomaly will correct itself.\" Earlier this year, Pfizer struck a landmark drug pricing deal with the Trump administration, which includes selling its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. Pfizer will also guarantee the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers.In return, the company will get a three-year exemption from President Donald Trump's pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. Denton said there is \"price compression and margin compression baked into\" the company's 2026 guidance as it plans to provide \"deeper discounts\" in its Medicaid business as part of the deal with Trump. ",

    "body": "Tarek Adieh, of Tampa, Florida, looks at cannabis flower from wholesaler Dep Kings at Champs Trade Show at the Palmer Events Center, Sept. 11, 2025.Jay Jannar | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that would broadly expand access to cannabis. Industry advocates, executives and researchers who spoke to CNBC said the changes would come with big implications for both consumers and the health-care industry. Trump said Monday he's \"strongly\" considering an executive order that would reclassify pot as a Schedule III drug under the Drug Enforcement Administration, which would place cannabis alongside Tylenol with codeine, rather than Schedule I with the likes of heroin and LSD, as it's classified now. The order would also authorize a pilot program allowing Medicare to cover cannabis products for seniors. The proposal is expected to apply specifically to cannabidiol products, better known as CBD, aimed at treating chronic pain, sleep deprivation and other age-related ailments, said Shawn Hauser, a partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP.CBD has spiked in popularity in recent years, moving into the mainstream via canned cocktails and body lotions, but has yet to win full-throated backing from federal drug regulators. \"I expect the executive order will make clear what kind of cannabinoids are covered, that they have to come from a federally legal source,\" Hauser told CNBC. While many in the cannabis industry view the shift to Schedule III as a done deal, the inclusion of a controversial Medicare provision adds an extra wrinkle that could embed cannabis-derived products into the U.S. health-care system, despite limited clinical evidence of their efficacy, some experts told CNBC. Insiders like Hauser expect the final order to define legal cannabinoids, administrative methods and a framework for Food and Drug Administration oversight.\"A lot of people want to see it, the reclassification, because it leads to tremendous amounts of research that can't be done unless you reclassify,\" Trump told reporters Monday. \"So we are looking at that very strongly.\"Rescheduling and Medicare coverage are likely to trigger new investments from institutional capital and investors that typically follow federal insurance coverage to big pharmaceutical companies, said Timothy Seymour, founder and chief investment officer of Seymour Asset Management and a CNBC contributor. \"The valuation of the sector will be worth a lot more because institutional investors will be allowed in, will have access and will have liquidity, and exchanges will trade them,\" Seymour told CNBC. \"That immediately could double or triple the sector.\"The push for reclassification comes as a 2024 report found that more Americans reported using marijuana daily, or near-daily, than reported drinking alcohol at the same frequency. It was the first time the share of daily use had flipped in marijuana's favor, based on analysis of 40 years of data from Carnegie Mellon University.A budtender organizes and inventories marijuana flower at The Health Center, a medical cannabis and recreational marijuana dispensary in Denver.Vince Chandler | Denver Post | Getty ImagesMedicare disagreementsThe Medicare initiative is being championed by billionaire Howard Kessler, a financier and longtime Trump ally who founded The Commonwealth Project in 2019. The organization says it advocates for senior care, including through cannabis use. Kessler and advocates like Hauser have urged the administration to bypass typical FDA hurdles — like yearslong clinical trials — and use a pilot program to gather real-world data on the safety and outcomes of cannabinoids in the senior population.Kessler did not respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment. In September, cannabis companies' stocks rallied on optimism that Trump would soon weigh in after he shared a Commonwealth Project video on Truth Social that branded CBD coverage as \"the most important senior health initiative of the century.\"However, the Medicare proposal has drawn scrutiny, even from other Trump allies. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has raised concerns about the cost and liability of such a program, the Washington Post first reported, while FDA officials argue that reimbursing Americans for non-agency-approved treatments would be unprecedented.Beyond the politics, the scientific case for medical cannabis remains contentious. Research shiftsThe FDA has so far only approved CBD-based drug Epidiolex to treat rare forms of epilepsy. This narrow approval reflects both regulators' caution and the fact that high-quality clinical trials are still limited for most of the other conditions where cannabis is being promoted.Critics warn that a Medicare pilot program could endanger seniors, a demographic that often takes multiple daily medications. A recent FDA-funded study suggested that prolonged CBD use may cause liver toxicity and interfere with other life-saving medications. \"It's not at all based on science. This is all based on money, and it's egregious. That's not the way we make medical decisions,\" said Meg Haney, director of the Cannabis Research Laboratory at Columbia University. \"[Kessler], who's a buddy with the president ... can make a lot of money selling something that has no evidence behind it.\"Other research has cast doubt on cannabis' efficacy entirely, suggesting it may not be effective for many of the conditions targeted by the proposed pilot, Haney said. For example, a 2023 review of 134 studies involving adults age 50 and older found medical cannabis to have inconsistent outcomes for improving conditions like end-stage cancer and dementia. The review also found more frequent links to harms including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and injury.Rescheduling cannabis would, however, ease barriers to conducting clinical trials that experts say have historically stifled scientific research.\"Medical research has effectively been under lock and key,\" said Ryan Vandrey, a Johns Hopkins University professor who helps run its Cannabis Science Lab. \"Schedule I makes large, placebo-controlled trials incredibly difficult. Without that data, policymakers are being asked to make decisions in the dark.\"Investing potentialFor investors, the specific terms of rescheduling are critical. Rescheduling would improve growers' access to banking and financial services because it would lift certain IRS tax restrictions, which bar cannabis businesses from deducting standard expenses. The economic backdrop is already shifting: The annual value of the U.S. cannabis production jumped 40% last year from the previous year, according to the Department of Agriculture. The global market for cannabis-derived products is projected to hit $160 billion by 2032, according to Grand View Research.Rumors of rescheduling and a possible pilot program helped shares of weed producers Tilray Brands and Canopy Growth jump 44% and 52%, respectively, on Friday.  As Seymour described it, Medicare coverage and federal insurance involvement is the \"holy grail\" that could unlock institutional capital.A Schedule III classification could also help legitimize the sector for institutional investors who have been hesitant to wade in, paving the way for more stocks to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and shifting valuations from retail sentiment to fundamental cash flows.\"The Schedule I classification is what has held back a lot of institutional investors,\" Seymour said. \"Having to go out and tell their shareholders ... that they own a company who's selling something that is on a par with heroin, LSD or cocaine ... is kind of a tough thing to swallow.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStocks of largest market cap cannabis companies in the U.S. Business risksIf cannabis shifts to a reimbursable prescription drug model or federal legality, the category could attract interest from major pharmaceutical companies and distribution could eventually migrate from state-licensed dispensaries to national pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens. That could spell trouble for smaller weed businesses.Already, large pharmaceutical companies have the deep pockets needed to fund the multiyear, double-blind clinical trials required for FDA-approved drugs — a barrier to entry that few current cannabis operators can surmount.However, Seymour views Medicare coverage as a catalyst for merger and acquisition activity rather than an immediate death knell.\"You are going to see more consolidation in the sector,\" Seymour said. \"Smaller companies that have good businesses, that are profitable ... are probably going to be seen as targets.\"Meanwhile, Green Thumb Industries CEO Ben Kovler foresees more competition among pharmaceutical companies and cannabis companies to achieve medical breakthroughs.\"The pharma sector, in the past, has been a major lobbyist against [cannabis] because it is a threat,\" Seymour said. \"Therefore, yes, it's a huge opportunity for pharma.\"— CNBC's Brandon Gomez contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, one of the finalists for the Federal Reserve chair job, showed support Tuesday for central bank independence.With President Donald Trump apparently in the final days of picking a successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, Hassett declined in a CNBC interview to directly address his own candidacy but said forging consensus is an important part of the job.\"The Federal Reserve's independence is really, really important, and the voices of the other people at the [Federal Open Market Committee], they're important, too,\" he said. \"So the way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data.\"Prior to last week, Hassett had been considered the leading contender for the job to take over for Powell, who is nearing the end of his second term as head of the central bank. However, Trump said last week that former Governor Kevin Warsh has come to the front of the pack as well, following an interview between the two last Wednesday.There has been some pushback against Hassett in recent days. Sources told CNBC that the president's advisors worry that Hassett will be perceived as too close to Trump and will do his bidding rather than seek to set interest rates in line with the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment.However, Hassett said his relationship with Trump shouldn't be held against him.\"The idea that someone isn't qualified for the job because they are a close friend who's worked well with the president is something that I think the president rejects,\" he said.Though he appointed Powell, Trump has been a constant critic of the Fed chief. Trump has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts, unsatisfied even as the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has approved three consecutive cuts since September totaling three quarters of a percentage point. Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee who came on board in September, has voted against each of those reductions in favor of half-point cuts.Hassett stressed the need for consensus building at the Fed. Trump has advocated that the Fed should consult the president when making rate decisions.\"The way you've got to drive interest rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data,\" he said. \"When you get things wrong, you explain why and fix it. So that's the way it moves forward. But the president is a seasoned observer of the economy, and if he has a good point, then I'm sure others will recognize it as such.\"Hassett and Warsh were part of five finalists for the job. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the process, said Tuesday morning on Fox Business that the decision likely will come in early January.",

Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA record number of educated young Chinese are flocking to government jobs for security as the world's second largest economy faces growing headwinds that have diminished prospects for private sector jobs.  As many as 3.7 million applicants nationwide, including graduates from the country's top universities, sat for the annual civil service exam last month. But only one in about 100 is expected to secure a place among the 38,100 entry-level government roles, starting next year. Many were willing to take those odds as private job prospects dim amid an economic slump and worsening business sentiment. Unemployment among 16- to 24-year-old urbanites in China has stayed above 17% since July, compared to around 10% in the U.S. Government jobs were once considered \"iron rice bowls\" for their stability and fixed hours. But as the Chinese economy opened up, the country's educated youth pursued higher pay and more job opportunities in the private sector, vying to join home-grown technology giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei. Now these \"Iron rice bowls\" are making a come back again, as a prolonged economic slump and Beijing's regulatory crackdown on certain parts of the economy, such as real estate, technology and tutoring firms, have led to large-scale layoffs in the private sector. The top 500 private firms in China slashed their workforce by 314,600 last year, according to an industry and commerce association body. Amid the mismatch between available roles and expectations, jobseekers are lowering their ambitions, and searching for government jobs.Take 22-year-old Coral Yang. She spent four months job hunting before securing a role at a local marketing agency, only to have the offer rescinded weeks later after the company scrapped the position as part of cost cuts. \"There aren't many openings out there. It's crushing to lose an offer after months of searching,\" Yang said, \"but it just shows how unstable the private sector has become.\" Yang, who graduated from a top university in Shanghai majoring in data analytics, is now preparing to take the civil service exam next year.  She is not alone. A growing proportion of students listed public sector jobs, including government agencies and state-backed firms, as their top career choice last year, rising to about 63% in 2024 from 42% in 2020, according to a survey conducted by recruitment platform Zhilian Zhaopin.     Within public sector jobs, students face better employment odds at state-owned firms with more headcounts — compared with government agencies — making them a safer option given the low passing rates for government exams, said Wei Shan, a senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute of the National University of Singapore. The number of graduates seeking jobs at private enterprises is declining, dropping to 12.5% last year from 25.1% in 2020, the survey showed. Rising uncertainty in the jobs market, layoffs and slowing wage growth in the private sector have pushed many youngsters to seek the \"security, predictable benefits and social prestige of public service,\" said Mingjiang Li, associate professor at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. China's education ministry has sought to bolster employment at privately owned enterprises, offering tax rebates, social insurance reliefs and subsidies to encourage hiring young graduates. But the incentives have been low. The Shanghai municipal government, for instance, offers just 1,500 yuan in one-time subsidy per new hire. Government hiring slowsApplications for public sector jobs surged, but openings are hardly keeping pace as local governments are struggling to expand headcounts, making civil service roles harder to come by. Fiscal strain from the property slump has left many local governments \"cash-constrained and reluctant to add staff,\" said Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis, noting that \"government hiring, after a period of expansion, has now flattened,\" making competition fiercer.  The new openings at government agencies jumped 66% in 2020 from a year earlier amid rising demand for public workers to enforce pandemic-induced lockdown and related efforts. But for 2026, the central government trimmed the headcount by 4% to 38,119. The competition ratio in some provinces now rivals the world's most selective universities ... quietly becoming one of China's most competitive national sporting events.Han Shen LinProfessor at New York University ShanghaiThus competition has become increasingly brutal: one in about 100 candidates will get hired next year, compared with one in 70 in 2023. The application-to-acceptance ratio for certain posts in rural area where jobs are already scarce was a staggering one in 6,470 applicants.“The competition ratio in some provinces now rivals the world's most selective universities ... quietly becoming one of China's most competitive national sporting events,\" said Han Shen Lin, a professor at New York University Shanghai.  A record number of college and vocational school graduates — some 12.7 million — are entering the job market next year, set to make the race even fiercer. As part of the push to absorb more employment, Beijing raised the eligibility age cap by three years to 38 for those with postgraduate degrees and 43 for those with PhD degrees, further increasing the candidate pool. But still, \"a significant share of the openings is being reserved for new graduates,\" said Shan, estimating that about 70% of new hires this year were graduates, up from less than 40% in 2019. Better work-life balanceThe surging demand for public service jobs is also the result of an increasingly disillusioned young population losing faith in private enterprises and attaching greater importance to work-life balance, experts say. \"More people are finding appeal in what they call 'lying flat' within the government system,\" said Shan, referring to the internet catchphrase where people drop out of the rat race and doing the bare minimum to get by. \"Of course, whether it's really like what people imagine is another question.\"  Many who successfully land government jobs find the rigid bureaucracy stifling, career advancement can be slow and gets more political the higher one climbs, said Neil Thomas, a fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis. \"This is hardly unique to China, but increasingly pronounced,\" he added.    Diminishing value of higher degreeMeanwhile, fewer students are betting on postgraduate studies. Candidates for the national postgraduate entrance exam that took place in October fell to 3.4 million, according to the education ministry, from a peak of 4.74 million in 2023, reflecting waning confidence in advanced degrees improving job prospects. \"The return on a graduate degree appears to be diminishing … the imbalance has led to a relative devaluation of the degree itself,\" said Xu, adding that many students no longer see an extra 2-3 years of study as a guaranteed path to better employment.  The Zhilian Zhaopin survey told a similar story. Vocational college graduates enjoyed stronger job prospects, with employment rates rising to 56.6% last year. Postgraduates, meanwhile, saw their chances deteriorate, with fewer than 45% landing offers, down from nearly 57% in 2023.Economists warn that an increasing share of top university graduates clustering in the public sector rather than pursuing entrepreneurial or high-risk private-sector paths could weigh on longer-term economic growth.  \"Over time, this trend could reshape China's talent landscape by strengthening the state bureaucracy's human-capital base while reducing innovation dynamism in the private economy,\" RSIS' Li noted.

    "body": "Lovable cofounders Anton Osika and Fabian Hedin. Credit: LovableVibe coding startup Lovable's latest funding round values the firm at $6.6 billion and includes U.S. VC firm Accel, sources with knowledge of the deal told CNBC.That figure is more than triple the $1.8 billion valuation the Swedish AI company achieved after closing its most recent funding round in July. It's Lovable's third in 2025 and follows a breakneck year of growth that's seen it become one of Europe's most valuable startups.Both sources asked to remain anonymous while discussing private information. Forbes previously reported in November that the round would value the company at \"around\" $6 billion.Accel was participating in the round, both sources said, which has not been previously reported. Accel participated in Lovable's previous round and has emerged as a key backer in the wave of new AI startups. It's participated in billion-dollar rounds for vibe coding startup Cursor and former OpenAI executive Mira Murati's AI company Thinking Machines.U.S. investor Khosla Ventures is also participating in the latest round, one of the sources told CNBC.Lovable, Accel and Khosla Ventures have been approached for comment by CNBC, but had not responded as this article went live.Founded in 2023, Lovable reported $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in November, just under a year after achieving $1 million in ARR for the first time. The startup's July fundraise picked up $200 million. As well as Accel, investors then included Creandum, Klarna founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski, ElevenLabs founder Mati Staniszewski and Synthesia founder Victor Riparbelli.watch nowLovable is Europe's leading player in the vibe coding space, which has seen huge investor interest in recent times.In the U.S., Anysphere, which created coding tool Cursor, raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November. In September, Replit hit a $3 billion price tag after picking up $250 million and Vercel closed a $300 million round at a $9.3 billion valuation.Based in Stockholm, the company is opening offices in Boston and San Francisco.Lovable's platform uses AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to help users build apps and websites using text prompts, without the need to understand coding.The startup said that 100,000 projects were being built using its platform every day when it announced its latest ARR figures in November.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersWhat started off as a particularly rough year for Tesla investors is turning into quite the celebration.Following a 36% plunge in the first quarter, the stock's worst period since 2022, Tesla shares have rallied all the way back, reaching an all-time closing high of $489.88, jumping 3.1% on Tuesday. They're now up 21% for the year. The prior intraday high was $488.54, reached almost exactly a year ago, and the previous record close was $479.86. The stock got a spark this week after CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest person, said Tesla has been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. With the rally, Tesla's market cap climbed to $1.63 trillion, making it the seventh-most valuable publicly traded company, behind Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, and slightly ahead of Broadcom. Musk's net worth now sits at about $684 billion, according to Forbes, more than $430 billion ahead of Google co-founder Larry Page, who is second on the list. Bullish investors view the news as a sign that the company will finally make good on its longtime promise to turn its existing electric vehicles into robotaxis with a software update. Tesla's automated driving systems being tested in Austin are not yet widely available, and a myriad of safety related questions remain.It's been a roller-coaster year for Tesla, which entered the year in a seemingly favorable position due to Musk's role in President Donald Trump's White House, running the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government and slash federal regulations. However, Musk's work with Trump, endorsements of far-right political figures around the world and incendiary political rhetoric sparked a consumer backlash that continues to weigh on Tesla's brand reputation and sales. For the first quarter, Tesla reported a 13% decrease in deliveries and a 20% plunge in automotive revenue. In the second quarter, the stock rallied but the sales decline continued, with auto revenue dropping 16%.The second half of the year has been much stronger. In October, Tesla reported a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue as buyers in the U.S. rushed to snap up EVs and take advantage of a federal tax credit that expired at the end of September. The stock jumped 40% in the period. Business challenges remain due to the loss of the tax credit, the ongoing backlash against Musk and strong competition from lower-cost or more appealing EVs made by companies including BYD and Xiaomi in China and Volkswagen in Europe.While Tesla released more affordable variants of its popular Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedans in October, those haven't helped its U.S. or European sales so far. In the U.S., the new stripped-down options appear to be cannibalizing sales of Tesla's higher-priced models. According to Cox Automotive, Tesla's U.S. sales dropped in November to a four-year low.Despite a difficult environment for EV makers in the U.S., Mizuho raised its price target on Tesla this week to $530 from $475 and kept its buy recommendation on the stock. Analysts at the firm wrote that reported improvements in Tesla's FSD, or Full Self-Driving (Supervised) technology, \"could support an accelerated expansion\" of its \"robotaxi fleet in Austin, San Francisco, and potentially earlier elimination of the chaperone.\" Tesla operates a Robotaxi-branded ride-hailing service in Texas and California, but the vehicles include drivers or human safety supervisors on board for now.WATCH: Why speed isn't selling EVs",
